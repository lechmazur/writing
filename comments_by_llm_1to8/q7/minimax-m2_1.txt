    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("frost creep... in delicate crystalline veins"). Information density is high, with most lines doing double work. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "the pauses between events held their own meaning" echoes "patient waiting for the precise moment"; "fear had dulled... worn away" is followed immediately by "She was beginning to understand." Template stems recur in the final third: "She had discovered," "She was beginning," "She rose," "She tucked," "She smiled." Deduction −0.4 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in the closure sequence. No grammar errors; specificity is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the thermal-mapping beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "spaces that had once rung with music" / "concerts and performances that had meant most" restate the same idea across adjacent paragraphs; "frosted" recurs four times in proximity without charged variation. The phrase "she had [verb]" scaffolds the final paragraph (had avoided, had encountered, had been preparing, had come, had succeeded), creating template cadence at closure. Figurative language ("like musical notation," "like insects trapped in amber," "like a divining rod") clusters densely without muddle but approaches decorative threshold. Clarity and propulsion remain solid; no causality break occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. The opening "which was unusual because nothing ever arrived for Aldric Vane anymore" efficiently establishes isolation and stakes. However, several template stems recur: "His hands had grown steady... his eyes had grown tired... his heart had grown something else" creates parallel scaffolding that feels mechanical. "A sound like a foghorn, distant and mournful" and "swollen and strange" lean toward stock phrasing. The phrase "wasn't quite a chair, wasn't quite a throne, but occupied both states at once" is clever but the repetition of "impossible" (impossible space, impossible light, impossible throne-chair, impossible lens) in close proximity becomes a minor loop. The closure paragraph is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with longer reflective sentences giving way to sharper action beats in the bell-ringing sequence. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or atmosphere. However, several loops and near-paraphrases appear: "the slow erosion of hope that sanctions inflict through absence rather than attack" followed closely by "the particular grief of proximity"; "a whisper becoming a promise becoming a declaration" is evocative but borders on stock cadence. The phrase "amplified quiet" recurs without evolution. Figurative density is controlled but occasionally tips toward purple ("water eventually carves stone," "altar of whispered resistance").

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("pilgrim of sparks," "tendrils of light caught between...stones"), but the accumulation approaches overwriting in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: nearly every sentence in the final paragraph carries metaphor or elevated diction, risking opacity. Paraphrase loops appear: "elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere" and the breathing description ("shallower, then deeper, then catching") recycle structure without adding pressure. Template cadence is visible in repeated "the [noun] [verb]" constructions. Register drift into mystical abstraction ("the veil between remembered and forgotten") clashes slightly with the concrete apparatus work. These artifacts lower momentum and clarity at closure, triggering deductions here and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is ambitious and textured with strong figurative density: "atoms too polite to mention their imminent departure," "origami made of hours." However, multiple beats stack metaphors without causal propulsion—"the way a held breath contains both the memory of inhalation and the anticipation of release" extends into abstraction rather than advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening: "The garden earned...Elara had spent...she understood..." Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph four repeats the temporal-folding concept across adjacent sentences. Information density is high but momentum occasionally stalls under ornamental weight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear, varied, and dense with information. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. A few phrases ("dancing like memories," "deliberate darkness") lean slightly toward stock metaphor, and "staggering grace" in the opener is evocative but somewhat abstract. The arrow description—"strange fletching... synthetic fibers... carnival's promotional banners"—exemplifies tight, world-building specificity. No filter-verb stacks or line-level artifacts. High information density sustains momentum, and the final image recharges earlier motifs (wall, seeds, futures) without summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose carries information density ("colors made sounds, not metaphorically but literally, a faint chime at the edge of perception"). However, the opening ~200 words stack exposition without advancing present action, and several metaphors border on overwrought ("flames the color of things unsaid," "a million small erosions"). No loops or major template cadence, but the piece could tighten its reflective passages to increase propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("bruised amber and soft viridian," "liquid silver," "luminous disbelief"), but appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or functional variation, triggering a −0.5 overwriting penalty. Paraphrase loops occur: "the portraits she took were never really stolen…just borrowed" echoes "the true gift…not the stealing of moments, but the revelation." Scaffold phrases recur ("quietly savvy," "luminous disbelief," "illuminated moments") without evolving meaning. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels, adding −0.3 for momentum drag. Information density is moderate; many sentences describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (ice as internal glaciers, glass as potential) is coherent. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "thawing" is restated across multiple sentences in the opening and closing without added pressure. Template cadence in the fourth paragraph: "He had stumbled… when the ice was melting then too and he was looking… What he found instead…" runs a predictable pattern. The phrase "temperamental temperament" is tautological. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed to understand") cluster in reflective beats but do not dull immediacy given the lyric mode. Overwriting in figurative density (nearly every sentence carries metaphor) without clear escalation triggers modest penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.6)
    Template-cadence check triggered: three successive complex sentences in paragraph two open with "The [noun]" constructions ("The whispered seashell... The revelation... The seashell"), creating drumbeat rhythm (−0.5). Paraphrase loop in paragraph six: "he had known the truth all along, had facilitated her mother's capture, had let Maya live a lie while using her as an unwitting pawn" and the following sentence "His transformation from guardian to captor" restate the same betrayal without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor strings appear in high-pressure beats: "words tumbled out like tide against rock," "moonlight poured through holes... like spilled milk," "transforming vulnerability into something sharp and usable" (−0.4). Cumulative line-level debt totals −1.1, disallowing 9+ and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high across most sentences without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," "topology of shadow," "patient language of stones." This creates textural richness but also mild overwriting that dilutes momentum. Paraphrase loop detected: paragraph three's "not through narration but through absence, through the spaces between marks, through the careful study of what remained unsaid" cycles synonyms without added pressure. Sentence openings vary; no hard clarity breaks. Template cadence in paragraph two: repeated "the way they..." and "the messages..." structures.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening and closing images anchor well. However, template cadence and paraphrase loops reduce propulsion: "the robot has come to understand" / "the robot reasons" / "Unit 7-Kappa understands"; "something fundamental" / "something essential" / "something more than mechanical feedback" / "something that might be called feeling" recurs as filler. The phrase "countless instantaneous decisions" and "looped timelines" + "timeline iterations" + "timeline loop" show synonym churn. These artifacts cluster in expository passages but do not obscure the closure image, keeping the penalty within-band.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is generally high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies, though several mid-section paragraphs open with "I" or "The" in adjacent sentences, creating minor template cadence. Two paraphrase loops appear: "words became unreliable vessels for truth" / "words could no longer be trusted" and "transparency was still possible" / "honesty...might finally be enough" restate without added pressure. Figurative language is dense in the opening and closing paragraphs (held tears, frozen forecourt, hopeful refractions) but mostly coherent. One mixed metaphor: "frost of mistrust" followed by "thaw" works, but "prison of calculated words" mixed with "freed...honesty" in the penultimate paragraph strains slightly. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery ("sap stains," "clouded from years of handling," "web of cracks"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the marbles' meaning is restated across paragraphs without added pressure. The phrase "wisely pragmatic" recurs three times as a label without fresh action tied to it. Minor scaffold remains in exposition about the elders' view and the investors' fate. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image alone, slightly dulling momentum. Overall clarity is high, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with strong image work ("iridescent membranes folding and unfolding," "prismatic blueprints"). Rhythm varies naturally and paragraph breaks create visual pacing. Minor redundancies appear: "subdued awakenings" recurs three times without reweighting, and "mechanically warm" appears twice as identical phrasing. The phrase "obliging sky mechanic" is used twice in identical construction within the same story, creating a small template echo. Figurative density is controlled, and no paraphrase loops or causality-obscuring artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats carry abstract scaffolding. "Lately inspired, she had told herself it was coincidence" introduces an unexplained phrase that doesn't land as idiom or irony. The phrase "the water damage spread like living things" mixes vehicle (living things don't spread like stains). The final paragraph loops thematic summary across multiple restatements ("transmission, as connection, as the only language…"). Figurative density in middle beats (constellations, chemistry, vocabulary of vibration) is high but remains mostly coherent. No major loops or filter stacks, but some redundancy in the closure reflection lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, no loops or scaffold, high information density. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor friction: "peripherally aware" appears three times (dream, console, illustration) in slightly mechanical pattern, though each use advances a beat. The metaphor "swaying in her like a damaged antenna" is vivid and character-specific. Figurative language is controlled and does not overload peak beats. Propulsion is steady; every sentence does work. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. Two notable issues: repetitive phrasing around "swallowed truth" (appears verbatim twice in close proximity) and a minor paraphrase loop in paragraph four ("voices into the darkness" restated as "frantic calls"). The final paragraph edges toward summary ("what he had come here to find—not answers, not proof...") where scene pressure would better sustain momentum. Figurative language is controlled and apt (headlamp "carving a pale tunnel," darkness "grown thicker and more substantial"), though one mixed metaphor: truth "swallowed and carried until it poisoned everything" conflates ingestion and toxin without clear vehicle logic.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is polished with varied rhythm and vivid specificity ("volcanic glass, black and unyielding," "soft rustle of turning pages"). However, paraphrase loops appear: para 1 and para 5 both describe the keeper's patient witnessing across seasons; para 2 and para 5 both describe the silence's regenerative work with near-identical phrasing ("mended the fractures," "regenerated what noise had worn away"). Template cadence in para 3 ("had learned," "had become") and final para ("had become," "had held"). Apply −0.6 for loops and stems per Q7 artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled with strong imagery ("light...took on a honeyed, surreal quality"). However, the piece carries paraphrase loops: "the preservation of wonder" is restated multiple times across paragraphs, and the final paragraph summarizes the thematic stance ("ordinary magic: not spells or enchantments, but...") already dramatized earlier. Template openings ("She was," "She understood," "She thought") cluster in exposition, reducing density. Apply −0.6 for loop and scaffold patterns that dull momentum without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but several passages lean into decorative phrasing: "the bronze quiet of the silo library, the silence of the post-dream world pressing against the concrete walls like a held breath" layers metaphor without advancing pressure. The opening's "oddness was not a single peculiarity but rather an atmosphere" is mildly scaffolded. Sentence openings vary well, and no paraphrase loops appear. The phrase "probe through these half-burned diaries with tools of brass and patience" is vivid and job-specific. Minor overwriting in the middle third (e.g., "the dragons in the tapestry began to make terrible sense") slightly dulls momentum, but the final paragraph recovers propulsion. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; grammar and tense are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. The opening line ("white finger pointing toward nowhere") anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several phrases recycle stem patterns ("he wrote... and did not know" three times in paragraph three; "the way" construction appears seven times across the piece), creating mild template cadence. The microdot specs metaphor is strong, but "transposed into a new key" repeats without added pressure. No loops obscure causality, and clarity remains high. The figurative language in the final paragraph (illuminating/shadow) feels slightly elevated but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, balancing long accumulative constructions with short beats ("11:47"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, method, or stakes. However, several scaffold patterns recur: "the [noun] of [noun]" structures cluster heavily ("loop pedal...chant...quality of stillness...investigation of thresholds"), and synonym churn appears in "dimensional anchor" / "threshold" / "edge of completion" across adjacent paragraphs without meaningful differentiation. The final paragraph's triple "where" clauses ("where Gabriel's struggle...where the possession...where hidden assumptions") stack template cadence, triggering −0.4 to −0.6 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "crystalline song," "upturned silence," "frost forming on glass." However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The structure rose… its walls transparent" restates boundary-blurring in adjacent clauses; "missed her childhood not as a single place but as a continuous stretch of light" then "always present yet perpetually out of reach" recycles the same abstraction. Template stems recur: "She traced… She understood… She began… She wrote… She felt." Apply paraphrase-loop (−0.2) and template-cadence (−0.5) penalties totaling −0.7 in Q7. Minor proprietary-word issues ("upturned silence" lacks clear physical anchor) reduce clarity at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully and figurative language (glowing stones, suspended instant, fractured corridors) establishes atmosphere. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty layering concept and image. However, paraphrase loops appear: "fractured timeline... fracture... fractured timelines... fragmentation" recurs across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. The phrase "the only way through was through" is a stock formulation. Template-stem runs ("she saw herself... she understood... she reached out... she floated") accumulate in the middle third, dulling rhythm. No critical opacity, but scaffold and metaphor density in reflective passages slow momentum without payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly controlled: "time seemed to pool," "tide receding from shore," "membrane, thin as paper." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Two significant drags: the phrase "audibly muted" is oxymoronic in ways that muddle rather than enrich (how does a deaf protagonist perceive "audibly"?), and the closing paragraph's future-tense summary loops through scaffold ("would become...would chip away...would become") instead of holding the present image. The untranslated "隔离" is a clear artifact. Information density is high in the cavern sequence but drops in the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear but shows repeated structural patterns: "She had [past perfect]" opens three sentences in paragraph two; "The [noun]" launches multiple descriptive beats. Paragraph six contains paraphrase loops: "simple pleasures represented exactly what was at stake" is immediately restated as "quiet courtyards...peace...stolen." The metaphor "motivation crystallized" followed by "stacks of storm records...were witnesses" mixes geological and legal registers without coherence. No major loops obscure causality, but momentum sags in exposition-heavy middle paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but multiple beats rely on synonym loops and paraphrase chains: "frayed coil," "rough fibers," "frayed end" recur without new pressure; "pattern-drawing," "spiral," "map," "translate" cycle across paragraphs. The third paragraph's "ethically playful part of Mira's nature—that curious impulse" is scaffold exposition. Template cadence in the opening ("had become," "had been," "had tried") flattens propulsion. These artifacts spread across the piece, totaling −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Information density is high; lines do multiple jobs—"skeleton of iron and stubbornness ringed by the hulks of ships" anchors setting, tone, and metaphor. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful: "hand reaching from a well," "chronic hush," "teeth of devastation." Minor: "beautifully, terribly unfinished" appears twice in quick succession, a small echo. Grammar and punctuation are clean; spatial choreography tracks clearly. Zero scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors ("static electricity rise against her fingertips like tiny electric admissions"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or concept. However, the final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "her half truths had always been whole lies" is immediately glossed as "useful ones, necessary ones," and "professionally thorough" and "the work was never finished, only suspended" restate prior content. Template cadence appears in repeated "she had [past perfect]" openers across multiple sentences. These artifacts dull the closure beat's sharpness, triggering cumulative deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery (inverted-ship shelves, starlight through the dome). Information density is solid: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme. However, several passages carry slight overwriting: "the way a ship's bell went silent when its owner died" and "invisible threads that bound people together" lean toward stock metaphor; "cautious exuberance" in the final beat feels like a thesis label rather than embodied state. Template cadence appears in the opening's triple example structure and in the paired backstory blocks (grandmother/mother) that mirror each other closely. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts, but figurative density in non-peak beats occasionally slows momentum without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Figurative language is controlled and earns its keep: "marsh-reed...hollow promise," "fruit of frozen quartz," "luminescent ache" all recur with evolving meaning tied to stakes. However, mild template cadence appears in the middle section: "She would stay. She would learn...memorize...bring...ask" stacks four parallel future constructions in succession without variation, creating a drumbeat rhythm during a pivotal beat. One paraphrase loop: "as something like anticipation" echoes the earlier "something different" without added pressure. Opening and closing lines are strong; the arbor as "a question carved from night" and final spirals "leading her deeper" charge the frame. No major loops or scaffolding beyond the noted parallels, and sentence openings generally vary.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the journey sequence. Clarity is maintained throughout. However, multiple lines exhibit paraphrase loops and stock openers: "She understood now what she must do" / "Sera realized with sudden clarity" duplicate the epiphany beat; "carefully, deliberately" is boilerplate intensifier; "The echoes returned...reborn and released, flowing together" loops synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening paragraph's list structure. Apply −0.6 for pervasive scaffold and loops; no additional causality break, so penalty remains in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often elegant (stalactites as downward forest, loss as "a stone that had learned to breathe"), but the final third stacks metaphors and abstract phrases without clear propulsion: "dovetailed with it," "fit into the mosaic of her being," "grief might…find its pattern too," "something like peace." These restate the same acceptance idea across adjacent lines, creating a paraphrase loop. The closing sentence runs 80+ words with nested clauses that dilute momentum at the closure beat. Sentence openings vary, but information density drops in the final paragraph. No severe artifacts, but the overwriting and loop in the closure passage pull the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.9)
    Density is uneven: the opening paragraph layers metaphors and abstractions ("shadowed library," "building's hidden arteries," "sapphire hush," "liminal and holy," "crawl space dwelling is not exile but calling") that slow momentum without advancing plot. Paraphrase loops appear: "methodical kindness is not performance but essence" restates what prior lines establish. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She stops...She lifts...She understands." The final two sentences form a loop, restating fulfillment and visibility without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("building's veins," "infrastructure's depths") and filter-verb stacks ("she hears, as if through water and years") dull immediacy in a peak beat. The untranslated character遗言 is a generation artifact that obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., linden leaf description also reveals Vera's evasion tactics). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective sentences giving way to shorter action beats at the trellis. Two friction points: "circuitously sincere" repeats as a phrase within two paragraphs, creating a minor loop; the "sustaining transformation" phrase in paragraph four edges toward thematic label-speak. No major scaffold or template cadence. Figurative language (bruises spreading, stone in chest) is coherent and embodied, not stacked to opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sentences carry information density (water wars → rain-reading → tidal causeway → convergence). Minor template cadence in the middle section ("where water had carved…each trickle…each pool") and one paraphrase loop ("how haggard she must appear, how her hands…how her eyes") flatten momentum slightly. No major loops or scaffolding, and the figurative language ("secret being whispered") remains coherent. The closing beat is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings show range. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character insight, or cave mechanics. The piece avoids major loops, though "learning to listen instead of looking, learning to inhabit the present" edges toward synonym pairing. Figurative language is controlled and apt: "sounds hung in the air like visible architecture," "dropped thoughts." One copy artifact ("small奇迹") and minor scaffolding in "something else entirely" (used twice in opening pages) reduce precision. The prose reads cleanly with strong verbs and concrete nouns. Propulsion is steady; the nine-day compression risks summary but maintains momentum through layered sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with good rhythm variation and sensory specificity ("salt crystals still clung to his notebooks," "ivory stones gleaming after rain"). However, several phrases loop or scaffold: "fragments" appears excessively across paragraphs without functional variation; "staggered intervals" is repeated verbatim in the final sentence as a direct callback to the prompt element; "compile fragments into meaning" recurs without added pressure. The final paragraph contains minor redundancy: "watched the boats continue to arrive" after establishing arrivals earlier. These artifacts dull momentum slightly but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant template cadence and paraphrase loops harm momentum. "Analytically artistic mind," "trembling certainty," and variations recur without adding pressure. Paragraph structure is repetitive: many begin with declarative setup + elaboration in identical stems. Figurative density is high throughout ("mist rose…like breath," "stars hung like holes," "vault around her") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). The confession beat itself is clear, but surrounding prose recycles "ancient," "forgotten," "unspoken" in synonym churn. Loop check: adjacent sentences restate (e.g., "the answers you seek are not hidden—they are waiting" rephrases the same idea). Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.8 to −1.2 in Q7, with loops touching the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues: "courageously kind offerings" in paragraph six feels slightly forced; "the skepticism remained—it was part of who she was, and she would not betray herself" in the final paragraph borders on explaining what the scene has shown. A paraphrase loop appears between "Her motivation shifted from documentation to creation" and the following elaboration. No major artifacts touch closure, so these remain contained deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally controlled. However, several issues accumulate: the unexplained Chinese character "永恒" is a proofreading error; phrases like "the spaces between spaces, the silence between heartbeats" employ template parallelism without added meaning; "the vast and terrifying absence" and similar abstractions dilute specificity. The final paragraph contains minor paraphrase loops ("not an ending but a doorway, not a cessation but a translation") that restate rather than advance. These artifacts touch but don't obscure the closure beat, triggering baseline penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but several beats summarize rather than dramatize: "she asked Darius to wait while she worked" compresses what could be active waiting; "Three weeks later, when approval came" elides the story's central test. Minor template cadence: "The ink pot sat... Elena understood... The application she produced..." in adjacent paragraphs. "Deathly vitality" and "liquefies rigid thinking" are metaphorically strained—life/death opposition is clear, but "liquefy" applied to thought process risks purple abstraction. No major loops, but density could tighten in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies; sentences advance atmosphere and character. Information density is high in the opening paragraphs. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the second paragraph's "She believed these sounds carried memory" is restated as "silence was not empty but full, that it held the compressed histories"; "earnest studious pursuit" recurs verbatim twice; "gilded-leaf标志" appears identically in two beats. The phrase "charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn" is repeated exactly. These loops and scaffold reduce propulsion in a piece already light on pressure. Apply baseline artifact penalty (−0.6 in Q7) for paraphrase and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the death certificate's effect is restated across two paragraphs ("declared nonexistent"/"mark gone"), and "one that could not be erased" / "one that shifted" / "one that belonged" creates a template-cadence run in the penultimate paragraph. Mixed metaphor: "accumulated like shells gathered from a shore that never remained still" conflates accumulation with instability in a way that muddies the vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "expecting nothing more than an abandoned project" / "not produce the discordant twang she anticipated" restates expectation without new pressure. Template cadence in reflection blocks: "she realized," "she understood," "she felt" cluster in the final third. The phrase "универсальный riddle of all the things left unsaid" mixes languages mid-phrase without pattern-teaching or payoff, reading as artifact. Stock metaphors ("dark as dead eyes," "abandoned thoughts") appear without fresh inflection. Minor filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("she realized," "she understood," "she felt") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch but do not fully obscure the closure, triggering moderate Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clear and sensory with varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high in the opening paragraph (raft city, carnival, dual role, apartment location, stone chip, Market Hall dismantling). Minor scaffold appears: "She needed to reorganize not just the physical space, but the community's response" restates the prior beat without adding pressure. The calliope callback and stone-chip reprise ("less like a relic and more like a promise") rely on explicit interpretation rather than image alone. No major loops or template cadence, but some telling replaces scene work in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence structures and strong verbs. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. The chemical-timer detail and regolith permanence are specific and integrated. Deductions: "purposefully curious, though she preferred to think of it as professionally obsessive" is a paraphrase loop that restates the same trait. The phrase "tiny monuments to human passage" and "humanity's most distant witness" in the final paragraph elevate diction into generic poetic register, risking template cadence in the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is high. However, several text artifacts cluster: "heartfelt artisan" (twice), "quiet" (four times), paraphrase loops in the opening ("limitless but a different kind of sight entirely" / "understanding that water refused to hide what other materials revealed slowly"), and the summary-heavy final paragraph that recycles concepts ("departures and arrivals," "decoding what was broken into what could fly again"). The middle beats flow cleanly, but scaffolding at open and close dulls momentum. No filter-verb stacks or register crashes in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character expertise, or interpretive accumulation. Minor scaffold appears: "the way moisture gathered differently near underground rivers" and "the way all things, given time, find where they belong" echo phrasing ("the way…") in the final third. No loops or muddle touch closure; figurative language (condensation as rivers, falcon's "deliberation") is controlled and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with purposeful variation in sentence length and structure. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. Minor scaffolding appears in the form of repeated explanatory phrases—"not merely a collection of buildings but a system of resonance" and "not to invoke spirits but to remind the buildings" follow identical syntactic templates. The metaphor density is high but mostly coherent; "feeling—a vibration that settled into the marrow" and "wound in the landscape" work without contradiction. One loop: "she walked" and variations appear frequently enough to create mild redundancy, though the repetition mirrors the character's method and may be purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language ("kelp curtains," "sunken cathedral," "spiraling column of silver and gold") is vivid without overwhelming. Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, memory, or transformation. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The gathered hush of the temple seemed to intensify" echoes the opening's "gathered hush of centuries," and "Marina gasped, drawing water into her lungs, but she felt no drowning. She felt the opposite" is a near-restatement. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("not as herself but as something greater: the gathered hush given form, the ephemeral rendered eternal, the last song...") stacks parallel clauses without propulsion. Minor: "unsnarl" (verb choice) and the extraneous character "羲悬" are small line-level slips. These artifacts do not obscure closure but reduce tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries density and vivid imagery ("copperlight repose settle over the black reef like a fever breaking into sweat"), but multiple sentences loop conceptually: "chasing the hush" and "sustained impossibilities" appear as synonym variations without advancing pressure. Template cadence emerges in the third and fourth paragraphs with repeated "he had" and "the" structures. Figurative language is frequent but not always coherent—"thread a labyrinth with your own story" mixes metaphors (threading ≠ labyrinth navigation), and "hover...in that other sense" introduces vagueness at a key moment. Several phrases read as elevated for effect rather than character necessity, weakening propulsion. Information density is high, yet paraphrase loops (e.g., "not to vindicate his father, not exactly, though that would come") stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high in places (the debt's origin compressed into one paragraph). Two craft issues lower the score: (1) Overwriting in the opening—figurative language in nearly every sentence ("luminous coffin," "smoke refusing to rise," "imprisoned light," "temperament of their keeper," "stars that never rose") without pattern-teaching or payoff; this registers as density without propulsion (−0.5). (2) Paraphrase loop: "The ghost bride had nearly finished her work. The young gardener would carry on now" restates the closure without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence appears in the debt-history paragraph ("She had been... he a... the price had been... but he had bargained") but remains functional. No loops or scaffolding touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear. Information density is moderate: many sentences do more than one job (e.g., "She understood now that sleepwalking had become her method" anchors both her state and the story's central mechanic). However, several paraphrase loops and stock phrases appear: "her consciousness drifting while her body navigated" is restated as "sleepwalking had become her method"; "beauty in ruins and purpose in devastation" recycles synonyms without added pressure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes ("transforming an empty pool of water into a site of reverence") and stacks abstract nouns ("healing and home"). Template cadence: "This was her gift and her burden," "This was her life's work now." Figurative language is vivid in places ("veins carrying memory instead of blood") but occasionally strained ("orchid solace bloom in her chest" mixes metaphors). No major clarity breaks, but the cumulative artifact load (loops, summary-mode telling, stock openers) prevents entry into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. Sentence openings vary effectively, and rhythm accelerates during discovery beats ("she saw that the gnomon…had been carved with symbols that matched the birthmark") then breathes in reflective passages. However, the piece carries minor paraphrase loops: "interrupted journey" recurs four times across the text, and the final paragraph's doubled structure ("a homecoming that was also a departure, a death that was also a kind of rebirth") reads as template parallelism. The untranslated "静脉" in paragraph one is a clear artifact. Filter-verb density is acceptable but clusters slightly in the opening ("she had crossed," "she stood," "she watched"). No loops touch the closure beat directly, so deductions remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high in setting detail, though some lines loop concepts: "carefully inventive hope" echoes "carefully inventive mind" from earlier without adding pressure. The phrase "futuristic nostalgia of an abandoned entertainment palace mingled with the ancient human need" stacks abstractions in a single beat without anchoring in concrete action. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally dense ("liminal territory where truth sometimes lived") without clear propulsion. No major loops or scaffolding, but the final third recapitulates the ritual (gathering clipboard, chalk, stepping out) in summary fashion rather than advancing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching (−0.5): "constellations blooming beneath her needle," "electric tension," "labyrinth of adjacent possibilities." Paraphrase loop in paragraph 4: "The galaxy charts weren't merely decorations; they were encoded records" immediately restates what prior paragraphs showed (−0.2). Template cadence in paragraph 9: "The servants who heard... The scribes who copied... The mothers whose sons..." creates list rhythm without pressure variation (−0.4). Information density is moderate; several scaffold sentences ("Let them think her foolish. Wisdom... was safest when disguised") restate prior material. No loops touch the closure beat directly; apply Non-closure Accumulation Cap at −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Figurative language is purposeful (roots as "crooked fingers reaching for absolution"). Minor deductions: "fierce tenderness" and "tender, fierce, unbroken space" repeat the pairing mechanically in the final paragraph; "the apology she'd owed for seventeen years" appears twice in similar phrasing (paragraphs 2 and 6); "the letter Maren had written but never delivered" and "the unsent letter" loop conceptually. These slow the closure beat slightly but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"pacific conflict-zone," "vernacular of shrapnel," "unknotting," "lotus-hearted ache"—and several metaphors crowd peak beats without clear pattern-teaching. "Lotus-hearted" and "terrible persistence" in the final line feel over-wrought. Template cadence appears in the backstory block: "She had been… her body now spoke… she had not chosen… but here she was." Paraphrase loop: "the coral fragment seemed to pulse… a piece of living architecture that built itself from damage" restates prior framing. Information density is moderate; some lines ornament rather than advance. No major causality break, but pervasive elevation and synonym churn lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is often striking: "fog had settled like sediment," "colors...like breath onto glass," "twisted stumps...like broken teeth." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and character together. Slips accumulate: "the blur of something that matters" is self-explanatory scaffolding; "the way all genuine joy carries within it the knowledge that it could end" tells rather than trusts the image; "as if it had given everything it had left to give" repeats the concept of depletion unnecessarily. These artifacts appear in non-closure beats but lower momentum. Deduction: −0.6 for scaffold/paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Two artifacts touch mid-story beats: "a轮" (likely a character encoding error for "skull" or similar) appears mid-paragraph three, breaking immersion; "bewitch" as a verb in "felt herself bewitch through a method" reads as non-idiomatic without pattern-teaching. The phrase "methodically infinite" in the final paragraph stacks abstract modifiers. Paraphrase loop appears in paragraph five: "She understood now why the garden had been built this way, why the walls curved just so" unpacks the same realization across two clauses without added pressure. These issues lower momentum but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting muddies key moments: "the particular warmth of a woman who knew secrets worth dying for" and "candidly cryptic, each furrow a sentence, each trellis a warning" stack modifiers without adding clarity. Paraphrase loops appear ("This was how the club operated—names never spoken" / "silent dialogue—tomatoes spelling out historical dates"). Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She understood what he meant. The seed wasn't merely botanical—it was philosophical resistance"). The closure beat itself suffers from figurative excess ("water table of rebellion") that abstracts rather than sharpens the image.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but largely coherent. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold: "shyly unstoppable" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "the long wait" recurs without evolution; "continues/continuing" is repeated. The photosynthesis metaphor is extended across multiple sentences in the middle third, flirting with overwriting. "Too long" and the author's self-edit note are meta-artifacts that break frame. Clarity is high, but density could be tightened by 15–20% without loss. Apply −0.6 for loop/scaffold and −0.2 for the meta intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("marble spun into glass," "memory hung in the air like frozen breath," "happinesses once common as sunrise," "dust of the absolute dark"). Paraphrase loops appear: "for as long as the museum of extinct feelings required its caretaker, for as long as there were names worth saving" restates the same idea. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "she had already begun preparing" after "she would need it again, tomorrow night and the night after that." Density −0.6, loop −0.3, cumulative −0.9 in Q7. Information density is low; most sentences ornament rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished with strong individual images ("braille written for the dead," "musicians finding their entrance"), but figurative density pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or escalation, flattening propulsion. Repeated phrase stems ("she understood," "she had," "she knew") and synonym loops ("silence," "held-breath," "absence but anticipation") create mild scaffold drag. The final paragraph contains a paraphrase loop: "silence that followed was not emptiness but held-breath, was not absence but anticipation waiting to become fact" cycles the same idea without new pressure. Grammar and syntax are clean, but the elevated register holds constant across emotional peaks, missing opportunities for rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "monument to some long-dead engineer's ambition to build harmony between human settlement and geological volatility" and "slyly heartfelt in their mundane specificity" load figurative language without teaching a pattern. Mixed metaphors: "dappled resolve" suggests light through clouds, not emotional texture. Template cadence runs in paragraph four ("He had mixed… encoding… ensuring…"). The final paragraph recycles "harmony" and "channels" without added pressure, creating a paraphrase loop. Applying the Overwriting and Patterned-artifact penalties: density (−0.5), coherence drift (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), paraphrase loop (−0.3), totaling approximately −1.7 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat. This disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages loop conceptually: the trust/waiting motif is restated across three beats without added pressure. "The particular weight of absence" and "the shape of healing she had been unable to name" are stock metaphor strings that reduce specificity in peak moments. Template cadence appears in the third paragraph's paired "songs about home, about the particular weight" construction. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy, triggering cumulative penalties of approximately −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language clusters densely without clear payoff: "crooked rivers," "prism light," "fractured hush," "diagram drawn in the new weather." Mixed metaphor in paragraph six: terrace "moving toward" the village "by currents that followed flight paths" conflates water, air, and architecture without coherent vehicle. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: parallel "that [clause]" constructions stack without variation. The scaffold phrase "the only maze that mattered" and synonym loop ("necessary distances" / "sacred threshold" / "boundary") dull closure momentum. No paraphrase loops severe enough to trigger full deduction, but density without clarity lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and vivid images. However, several patterns accumulate: "廊 glowed" is a visible encoding artifact (Chinese character mid-sentence); abstract modifiers stack without concrete grounding ("softly ingenious," "patient attention," "trembling lift"); and some phrases loop conceptually—"the rhythm of belonging" recurs without evolving pressure. The opening sentence's nested construction ("dreamed in reverse") and "forgetting" as a noun read as ornamental. The firefly description is strong, but figurative density in reflective beats ("conversations with the void," "blur into something like kinship") trends toward stock lyricism. Information density is moderate; some lines describe rather than advance. No major clarity breaks, but momentum sags in the middle third's archive browsing.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; sentences layer setting, action, and interiority effectively ("She worked by conjecture, piecing together fragments the way a sailor reads scattered clouds"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "every surface seemed to hum with the residue of things not yet forgotten" is restated conceptually in "reading the residue that living beings left behind." The phrase "some paths didn't fade gradually. Some disappeared all at once" uses template cadence without new pressure. The final paragraph contains minor overwriting ("iridescent walls held their light steady, patient witnesses") that borders on symbolic convenience. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for distinct paraphrase and template issues.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several lines paraphrase without adding pressure: "carefully constructed frameworks within which randomness could occur" restates the opening thesis, and "making the predictable unpredictable through the only means he trusted—calculation dressed as intuition" loops the concept without advancing stakes. Figurative language clusters in reflective beats ("choreography of chance," "calculated wilderness," "serenading monotony") without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure. Filter verbs ("he had learned," "he had chosen") stack in expository mode. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("Each gesture… each choice… each journey") dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without clear payoff—"architecture of her bones," "fractured light the entire vocabulary of the tides," "small sounds of evening insects beginning their songs"—creating decorative density rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops: paragraph one states exile twice in adjacent constructions. Template cadence in paragraph four: three "felt" constructions in close succession. The final paragraph stacks theme statements that could be cut, and "the tide dancer smiled, and it was the smile of someone who..." is a filter-verb construction that distances the key realization. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically dense, with strong sensory anchors ("cool weight," "rough edges worn by rains"). However, template cadence appears in stacked clauses: "each one distinct, each one connected"; "This is her purpose, clear in its complexity, simple in its execution." Paraphrase loops occur between "the water returning to its meditation" and "the last ripple reach the edge and disappear, completing its journey from chaos back to order." Line-level clarity is high, but redundancy dulls momentum in the final third. The phrase "before everything shifts" repeats without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but the piece suffers from figurative density and register drift in key beats. "The landscape of her survival mapping itself," "slow dance of celestial bodies," "hard softness," "gently skilled fingers," and "translate the pain" stack metaphorical and abstract language across adjacent lines, especially in the opening and closing paragraphs, without pattern-teaching or payoff that justifies the load. Template cadence appears in the final third: "not to punish herself, but because…," "not to speak to Elena but to speak for her." These artifacts dull immediacy and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.6 baseline, touching closure raises it to −0.9). Starting mid-7s, deduct ~0.9 total.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence-level craft is clean with varied syntax and no grammatical errors, but information density is low: most sentences restate the research premise in synonym variations without advancing situation or knowledge. Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs (e.g., paragraphs 2, 5, 12, and 18 all rephrase "hope requires methodology"). Template cadence is visible in repeated "she understood that" and "her work" constructions. The prose is polished but weighted with conceptual redundancy and scaffold phrasing that dulls momentum. Reading aloud reveals rhythmic competence but a drumbeat of similar-length declarative sentences that flatten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is often luminous ("ivy pressing against shattered windows like curious animals seeking warmth") with high information density and varied syntax. However, multipleparaphrase loops appear: the building "dreamed" is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure; "legacy's burden" recurs as near-synonym; and the phrase "half-burned diaries" is used twice in adjacent beats. The untranslated Chinese insertions (现代, 记录的) are generation artifacts that obscure sense and break rhythm. Template cadence in several expository transitions ("The problem, as always," "But more than disaster") flattens momentum. Apply −0.6 for loops and artifacts, with an additional −0.3 for the untranslated tokens that touch a key discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery (water droplets catching light, dawn coaxing shadows). However, multiple instances of near-paraphrase: paragraph 2 restates Aria's grace three ways without adding information; paragraph 6 recycles "mirrors begin to stir" / "surfaces growing watchful, receptive" / "unlocking something deep within each mirror." Template cadence appears in paragraph 7: three sequential sentences open with "The [noun] [verb]" structure. Filter-verb cluster in paragraph 4 ("She understood that persuasion required...that the most profound changes came") stacks two abstractions. Figurative density in final paragraph ("seeds of possibility," "sleeping mirrors," "coded lullabies") without escalation. Apply −0.8 cumulative for loops and template patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and controlled with varied syntax and strong verbs ("bled into night," "wreckage of ancient grudges"). Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, the final paragraph introduces mild scaffolding: "messy, incomplete, beautiful in its imperfection" echoes "flawed and beautiful in their incompleteness" from two paragraphs prior, and "endless, gentle muster" repeats the "operatively gentle" motif without adding pressure. A paraphrase loop appears when "she understood that she had found her own redemption" rewrites the insight already dramatized in the handshake beat. Applying −0.4 for loop and scaffold that dull closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong verbs. However, several lines carry overwriting: "the salt flat stretched toward every horizon, a vast expanse of white that hurt her eyes and silenced her thoughts" stacks description, and "fractured grace" reads as ornamental. Template cadence in the backstory block ("She had chosen... She had given up... She had been there") flattens rhythm. The final beat avoids loops and closes with a clear image. Information density is moderate; some sentences ("They were both right") add flavor without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, but several patterns accumulate: "each one," "this was," and "she had" sentence stems recur across paragraphs; paraphrase loops appear ("the lullaby of conformity was a subtle thing, sung in lullabies"). Stock metaphors like "golden filaments of individual spirit" and "prison of beauty" lean on familiar phrasing. The metaphor of "threads" and "untangling" is extended throughout but never grounds in a concrete mechanic—how does one perceive a non-physical thread? Information density is high in description but low in action advancement. Template cadence and synonym churn in reflective beats trigger −0.8 in Q7; no artifacts touch closure directly, so high-band remains possible elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. However, several beats loop conceptually: "half-lit epiphanies" appears twice with near-synonym phrasing; the ethical-storytelling thesis is restated in the penultimate and final paragraphs. Figurative density ("fallen celestial eye," "combustion," "horizontal monument") accumulates without full integration into action. The final paragraph's abstract summary ("the stories we refused to complete") recaps rather than trusting the image of the planted stick. Template cadence in the long participial openers appears across multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong image density ("ghost-impressions of green against the gray pumice," "orange speck against the gray"). However, the piece carries multiple paraphrase loops: "temporary structures" and "transiently rooted" recur without added pressure; "signals meant for" appears twice in proximity; "the patient work/construction" cycles near the end. The phrase "her esoteric realist's mind" functions as a filter-verb stack equivalent across three beats. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("knowing she would build… knowing that the act…"). These artifacts dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack, preventing entry into the 8+ band despite otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the craft beats. No major loops or scaffold. Small deductions: "After forgiving yourself, the world looks different" is a stock opener for that paragraph; the final paragraph summary ("not a monument to the past but a living archive") slightly over-explains where image would suffice. Figurative language is controlled ("guilt sat like a stone," "names rose in the air like breath"). Sentence openings vary and clarity holds. Propulsion is solid through the night sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and purposeful compression. Minor artifacts include the visible encoding error "颤动ting" in the first draft (corrected in the rewrite) and paraphrase loops: "decaying directive" described twice in close succession (inheritance paragraph), and "this room, this seal, this moment" recurs without added pressure. Figurative language ("leaves parting like curtains," "emotional cartography") is coherent but dense in the final paragraph, approaching overwriting. Information density is high; no scaffolding stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the archive-discovery sequence. "Diagrams that mapped the tile's numeric patterns to star positions and palace corridors alike" carries efficient specificity. However, paraphrase loops appear: "encrypted devotion" recurs in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "schematic representations" is repeated within one beat. Template cadence in the opening: "The astronomer Maruk counted...for he had learned...The palace where he had served...Yet Maruk remained, for the rooftop..." cycles identical causal stems. The Chinese-character artifact "脚步声" breaks clarity. Figurative language ("whisper of deeper order," "sealed not with blood or seal but with mathematical poetry") occasionally stacks without advancing the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several paraphrase loops: "Reality is falling apart" echoes the prior paragraph's "fracture in reality"; "not in my mind—in my cells" restates the cellular-memory claim in adjacent beats (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: "resentment calcified his heart into something the changing world could not touch"—calcification implies brittleness, yet "could not touch" implies imperviousness (−0.5). Template cadence in mid-section: "The space where...gaped," "You are broken," "Was made out of..." (−0.3). Cumulative line-level debt totals −1.2. The closure beat is clean, so non-closure cap applies: base ~7.1 reduced to 5.9.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or concept. However, several template-cadence runs appear: three consecutive sentences in paragraph three begin with variations of "She had/took/began," and the final paragraph uses parallel "the [noun] [verb-ing]" constructions four times. Mixed metaphor in "breath against glass...pressed against each other" conflates breath-on-surface with two solids pressing. Stock phrasing includes "rising sharp and clear against a sky" and "perpetual half-light." These artifacts cluster but do not obscure the closure image, warranting moderate penalty in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. Several passages show overwriting: "the space between them, carrying in her hands the evidence of her brokenness and her repair, her failures and her persistence, her accidental wisdom earned through the only way that ever mattered" stacks abstractions without fresh propulsion. The phrase "deciduous vows made manifest" and "accidental wisdom that arrived unbidden and unearned" drift into elevated register. Minor paraphrase loop: "forgotten contents" echoes "forgotten hair ribbon" within a paragraph. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. The orchard-as-constellation image is vivid and specific. Clarity remains high, but figurative density in reflective beats reduces momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing images. However, figurative density is high throughout—"memory-fruit," "honey through a sieve," "ink dissolving in water," "water through a broken dam"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Template cadence appears in the third paragraph: "The inheritance had never followed...she understood now...her grandmother had received...who had received...who had received" creates a looped stem pattern. Paraphrase loops appear between paragraphs two and three (the inheritance's nonlinear nature is restated). Minor scaffold phrases like "if one could call" and "she understood now" pad without advancing. Artifacts do not obscure the closure image but accumulate to −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is high; no grammar or tense errors. Information density is moderate—many sentences advance atmosphere or concept without altering situation or choice. Paraphrase loop: "She understood now why she had been summoned" / "she understood that the rescue mission" restates theme across paragraphs. Template cadence: "She found…," "She understood…," "She realized…" recurs across beats. Figurative language ("unheard symphony," "crystalline note") appears frequently but remains generic rather than vehicle-specific. Mixed metaphor: "cracks spreading through ice" (frozen) / "rippled through" (liquid) within one clause. Apply patterned-artifact baseline: −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for mixed vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long sentence ("The fog had swallowed...") contrasts with shorter beats at closure. One minor paraphrase loop: "recapture something that memories alone could not hold" echoes the opening "phantom passengers who remembered" without added pressure (−0.2). "Blissful aberration" and "unkindled solace" are high-register phrases that fit voice but border on ornamental in peak beats. Information density is high; no scaffold or template cadence. Figurative language (rivers beneath ice, veil lifting) remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clean, but several phrases loop conceptually: "fables of absence" recurs without added pressure, and "warmly methodical" appears twice as scaffolding. "The particular excitement of a scholar" and "simple, undeniable presence" edge toward generic descriptor stacks. Information density is adequate but not exceptional. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm modulates well (long, layered sentences in exposition compress to shorter beats during discovery). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (crack patterns = diagnostic method + thematic resonance). However, paraphrase loops appear: "relentless waves of light and sound" / "unceasing bombardment" restate the same pressure within two paragraphs, and "silence into a forgotten luxury" / "remembered what it felt like to exist without...frequency" echo closely. Template stems recur in the opening ("The beings themselves remained," "The mapkeeper's life had prepared"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull propulsion in non-closure beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence-length variation is present, but template cadence dominates: multiple independent clauses joined by commas and "and" across long runs (paragraph two opens with three such structures in succession). Paraphrase loops appear in paragraph four ("could the shard be used to rekindle" / "her blessing had been preparing her for this moment"), restating intention without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster: "thistle-blown hope," "winds that could not be contained," "spark of connection," "hummed with purpose." Register drifts into thesis-speak in the final paragraph ("proving coincidences had meaning was not just her duty but her gift"), clashing with prior sensory grounding. Information density is uneven—paragraph one front-loads eleven years of context while the prism discovery compresses into summary. Figurative language in most sentences of the final third (pavilion approving, ancient systems recognizing, shattered pieces reassembled) without pattern-teaching triggers overwriting penalties. Pronoun references remain clear and grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no mechanical template runs. Information density is high in descriptive passages ("crystal whispering forecourt," "fog becomes solid"). However, the piece suffers from conceptual paraphrase loops: "collective memory of a people," "collective memory was precisely this," "collective witness" cycle through adjacent paragraphs without adding pressure. Several lines restate the same thesis in different metaphors (fog/solid ground, monument/memory, sculptor/creation) without propulsion. The final paragraph contains a minor filter-verb stack ("felt her own identity shifting, becoming less a thing she carried") that dulls immediacy at closure. Apply −0.6 for loops and −0.3 for closure-beat filter density.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but coherent—"hope itself had developed its own gravity," "nature's quiet rebellion against all those centuries of siege logic." However, multiple beats engage in paraphrase loops: the grandmother's knowledge is restated three times in different metaphors without advancing pressure, and "serious playfulness" is explicitly named after being shown. Template cadence appears in the preparation sequence: "She spread… she continued… she carried… she placed… she lit…" across five consecutive beats. The overwriting in high-density metaphor and the scaffold phrasing lower propulsion and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty, capping the category below 7.5 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally vivid with strong specificity ("jade cicada," "mineral coolness," "cathedral"), but several passages loop conceptually: the transition-period theme is restated across multiple paragraphs without adding new pressure. Template cadence appears in the reflection-heavy middle ("She saw… saw… saw…"). Figurative density is high throughout, occasionally slowing momentum ("silence stretched… like the surface of a pool waiting for a stone" followed by more metaphor). Information density is strong in the opening and closing beats; the middle sags slightly under the weight of backstory and thematic assertion. No filter-verb stacks or grammatical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but largely coherent. However, repeated abstract coinages ("intangibly tangible" appears three times, "gilded hush" four times) function as thematic tags rather than earning new meaning each time, creating a paraphrase loop. The phrase "she understood now" and variants appear in three consecutive paragraphs, summarizing insight rather than advancing pressure. Metaphor density at peaks ("the embrace of someone she had never learned to recognize," "the captured breath of everyone who had ever stood where she stood now") blurs specificity and slows momentum. Line-level clarity is mostly intact, but scaffold phrasing and synonym churn reduce propulsion in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are not template-driven. Information density is adequate but several lines paraphrase without advancing pressure: "the knowledge passed down through generations of operators who understood that silence could be instructed, that the absence of sound could be taught to embrace" loops conceptually. The phrase "fluidly logical" appears twice as scaffold without dramatization. Figurative language is dense in the opening and closing thirds (storm glass as "representation of silence," hush as cathedral) but does not muddle clarity. Minor loop penalty (−0.2) and one register-elevated phrase that slightly stalls momentum in the grandmother's exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is legible and imagistic, with strong figurative density: "crystallized light," "grass that hummed with harvested starlight," "colors so old they had fossilized into something like stone." However, repetitive sentence stems ("she had," "the orchard," "the murals") and synonym loops ("patient enough...yet bold enough"; "what had been...what might yet be"; "what had been lost...what might yet be found") create template cadence. The stray Chinese character "炽热" is a generation artifact. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the Throne's purpose without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without teaching a pattern or varying cadence under pressure: "thresholds," "suffocating," "drowning," "sanctuary," and "bridges" appear in nearly every paragraph, often in adjacent lines with overlapping meanings. Paraphrase loops are visible: "sanctuary implied safety" / "she had forgotten what safety meant"; "love could suffocate" / "some embraces were simply another form of drowning." Template cadence in the opening ("selecting each charred timber," "creating a space," "she called it") and filter-verb stacks ("she understood," "she had learned," "she understood then") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final paragraph clusters abstract declarations where concrete image would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "promises could be traps, beautiful lies dressed in the language of hope" front-loads abstract thesis, "the way her grandmother must have felt...the way Maya herself felt now" is paraphrase loop, and "the bolt sat cold and ordinary...but something had changed" restates without added pressure. Template cadence: "she should have / she found herself / she grabbed / she wondered" in paragraph two. Figurative density ("frozen waterfalls," "heartbeat beneath the surface," "taste like anticipation and copper") in the climax muddies rather than sharpens. Deductions: −0.6 loop/scaffold, −0.4 density, −0.3 cadence = baseline ~5.9; artifacts touch closure (final paragraph restatement), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, several adjacencies loop: "secrets kept in plain sight" immediately after "deliberately placed," and "sound did not emerge as she expected, did not play" uses template negation twice in one beat. The phrase "first yawn of evening" appears identically three times. These artifacts don't obscure causality but create mild drag. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors ("frozen stars," "waking insects"). However, multiple passages loop conceptually: "forgotten" recurs as a modifier (forgotten place, forgotten performances, forgotten patterns) without escalating meaning, and the phrase "as reality shifts" appears twice as a structural marker without on-page causality. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("possibilities...captured...in wooden form and dancing strings, have weight and worth") that dilute propulsion. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt the forgotten patterns...stir") in key beats reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere, but several prose artifacts harm momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: the opening paragraph restates Mara's archival philosophy three ways without adding pressure. Template cadence runs in "she had become...she had come...she had learned." The phrase "examining unknown" (used twice, opening and closing) reads as syntactic error or forced motif without clear meaning. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "the button...like a pressed flower...like a compass needle" stacks competing metaphors. Apply baseline artifact penalty −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template cadence; the closure beat is not directly touched but momentum drags in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though some phrases loop conceptually: "carefully resourceful" appears twice verbatim across paragraphs one and four, and "revised histories" recurs without reweighting. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. "Amber-lit streets," "auric lagoon," and "glittering in the dark water like scattered codes" are vivid without purple excess. Minor template cadence in paragraph two: "She had perhaps an hour…" / "Her contingency plan…" / "Now it was…" uses parallel structure without propulsion gain. The final paragraph's "The revised histories would meet their revision" is clever but slightly precious, and "carefully placed truth" echoes the opening's "careful resourcefulness" as thematic scaffold rather than fresh line work.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is competent with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several passages exhibit density overload and template cadence: "He raised his saxophone… began to play. The first note emerged… seemed to summon… It was not music… but something older." Stock metaphor fragments ("breath against a membrane," "thread through a needle") appear in multiple high-pressure beats without transformation. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster in the middle third, dulling immediacy. Information density is moderate; many sentences do atmospheric work without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("patience of stone," "boundary… thin as spider silk," "genetic memory of a thousand harvests"), creating texture but occasionally blurring propulsion—multiple metaphors cluster without pressure linkage. The phrase "she always emerged transformed always" is a template artifact; "mossy delight swelling in her chest" mixes registers awkwardly. Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm modulates, avoiding monotony. No paraphrase loops or severe clarity breaks, but the prose leans toward ornament over momentum in peak beats, earning a −0.5 deduction for pattern density without escalation payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening stems are distinct. Information density is strong: "broken-clock tinkerer" compresses backstory and character in two words. Figurative language is purposeful without overwriting: "rusted to the color of dried blood" and "leaves could no longer follow her down" carry spatial and thematic weight. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or template cadence detected. Grammar and sequence are clean. The prose is clear and propulsive with high specificity in nouns and verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is generally high, and the repair sequence propels through concrete action. However, several prose artifacts lower the score: the untranslated Chinese fragments (石头, 追求, 公式) are clear generation errors that break readability. "Factually mystical" appears twice and reads as oxymoronic filler rather than precise description. Minor template cadence in the reflection blocks ("She had called...She had dismissed...she had come") creates rhythmic repetition. The phrase "eyes washed clean by tears and rain" borders on stock metaphor. These issues cluster but don't obscure the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density supports atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the attribute she wore modestly—fearlessness" is immediately restated as "exhaustion with fear itself"; "simple in description but impossible in practice" is scaffolding that could be cut; "the familiar ache in her chest that never quite healed, the wound that motivated her work" loops the same idea. Stock phrases cluster: "threads of amber light," "sacred absurdity," "luminous ache." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats (−0.6 in Q7 for template loops and stock metaphor strings).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative density throughout ("anesthesia dissolved like sugar in rain," "time had become a rubber band") maintains consistent voice and advances atmosphere without obscuring causality. Minor template-cadence slip: three consecutive "she [past verb]" constructions in paragraph four create brief rhythmic monotony. Information density is high—most lines layer body state, world detail, and thematic weight—and the final sentence's syntax ("would demand a price she had not yet calculated, would ask her to trade") mirrors the accumulating obligation effectively. One paraphrase loop: paragraph three restates the proprioception-as-curse idea across two sentences without added pressure, triggering −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the market and alchemist scenes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I had thought I was honoring...Now I understood: I was being prepared" restates the same realization. "Between-worlds translator" is explained twice (practitioner paragraph, then alchemist's label). Template cadence in the middle: "She had given...She led...She examined" runs filter-verb stacks. These artifacts don't obscure closure but dull momentum in key beats, warranting −0.6 to −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (dust → air movement → hatch outline compressed into one paragraph). Clarity holds throughout with strong verbs ("sputtered," "transmit," "unwind") and specific nouns. Two frictions lower the score: "weightless burdens he carried without complaint" and "the particular silence that follows mechanical surrender" drift toward elevated register at the opening, and the phrase "echoes—impressions left behind by intense human emotion, replaying themselves endlessly like a scratched record" reads as scaffold exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The closing image ("ready to discover what ceilings hid when no one was looking") recharges prior material cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening third (Negotiation, glass orchard, frost-reading compressed into three paragraphs). However, paraphrase loops recur: "whisper… compressing itself" / "compressed histories" / "compress… eternities" cycles the same root across beats without escalating meaning. Template cadence appears in the middle: "She had heard… people had learned… world had been" stacks past-perfect constructions. The metaphor "climate responded to thought" and "night-sweat of reality" is vivid but borders on mixed vehicle (sweat as thought-weather). Minor clarity slip: "运作" (Chinese characters) appears mid-sentence, likely a copy error. The final line's "learn to listen" risks cliché, though it coheres with prior rustling imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong opening line and vivid imagery ("visible time...pooled like amber honey," "hollow-eyed and desperate, their escape pod cracked"). Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding or atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in the reflection-heavy fourth paragraph: "The mirrors were...," "She uncovered...," "The burnished sorrow..." creates a repetitive stem pattern. The penultimate paragraph contains conceptual loops—"a single story, a single future" / "multiplicity...baroque complexity...both lost and found"—where adjacent phrases restate rather than advance. The closure paragraph recovers with concrete imagery (cloth over mirror, imagined civilization). Deduction for template runs and thematic paraphrase, but artifacts do not obscure the closure image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm modulates well between meditative setup and the tightening final act. Information density is high in the opening exposition but slackens in the middle third with paraphrase loops: "the orchestrion had been silent since the theft" restates what "its pipes empty of breath, its bellows collapsed" already conveys. Template cadence appears in reflection: "He had learned then... He had felt then... Some nights, sitting in the darkness..." (~three consecutive past-perfect stems). The final image is clear and propulsive. No mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold ("the chip itself was no larger than a thumbnail, veined with impossible red") adds texture without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clean with high information density and varied rhythm. The opening and closing images are strong. However, minor scaffold appears: "simple and sufficient fact," "exactly where one was meant to be" in the final beat risk abstraction that slightly dulls immediacy. "The factory had closed, and in its silence, this place had opened" is a tidy closure couplet but borders on over-explained thematic bookend. No loops or paraphrase chains; figurative language is coherent. The deductions are small and do not touch causality, capping penalty at −0.4 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; sentences often do double work (e.g., "navigators before satellites" anchors her competence and the GPS as plot trigger). Minor scaffold appears: "understanding how salt and current shaped" and "felt a clarity she hadn't experienced" lean slightly tell-heavy. "Turbine-hum reverie" in the storm paragraph and "timewoven alliance" recur as phrase-templates across multiple beats without full pattern-teaching. The closure beat ("each motion a prayer, each curve an invitation") stacks parallel constructions purposefully, but earlier runs approach template cadence without payoff. Apply −0.6 for mild template drift and figurative density in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and strong sensory specificity ("burnt orange and deep gold," "warm, fragmented showers"). Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the opening's "questions that others dismissed as idle fancy" is restated as "the question consumed her...filling every quiet hour with its mystery"; the discovery beat recounts "noticed something she had overlooked for months" then immediately explains what she's seeing in a long, clause-stacked sentence that cycles through "hidden layers...hidden layers" and "etched design...etched glass." The phrase "reckon with what she was seeing" uses "reckon" intransitively in a way that reads slightly awkward. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "It was not merely about...but about...about..." creates a minor rhythmic stall. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems that touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is steady through the descent sequence. No loops or synonym churn. Line-level clarity is high. Minor overwriting: "that searing mixture of grief and wonder that had defined her entire adult life" stacks modifiers at a reflective beat; "crystalline, each memory preserved in perfect clarity like an insect trapped in amber" layers metaphor without added pressure. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "saw her grandmother rising") appear but do not stack densely. Information density is moderate; some sentences could do more than one job.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.1)
    Syntax varies and rhythm generally supports the tone. However, several scaffold phrases appear: "This was not resurrection," "This was reimagination," "This was the method"—template cadence that mechanically guides the reader. Paraphrase loops are present: "taking the essence of what had been and allowing it to become what could be" restates the prior sentence's content. Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching ("seeds waiting for rain," "sketch drawn in fog"). Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs, but some ("watching an entire civilization begin again") summarize rather than advance. No major clarity breaks, but propulsion slows under the weight of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Figurative density is high but purposeful: "amber light through a window left ajar," "sediment," "fireflies in a jar." Information density is strong—most lines advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or thematic layering. Two frictions: (1) The Chinese fragment "悬在半空" in paragraph one is unexplained, breaking lexical consistency and reading as a generation artifact (−0.4). (2) A paraphrase micro-loop in paragraph four: "no genuine vow would ever be truly lost, only waiting" echoes "they had been speaking all along…only now had the world grown quiet enough to hear" within two beats, restating fulfillment-through-silence without added pressure (−0.3). Sentence openings vary, rhythm supports the mystical register, and no scaffold or template cadence mars the closure. Proofreading is otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many lines doing double duty (setting + emotion, action + theme). However, figurative saturation appears in most sentences of key beats without clear pattern-teaching: "coiled with potential energy," "yarn winding onto a spindle," "water finding its level," "river seeking its source" stack within close proximity. Two paraphrase loops touch the closure: the final paragraph restates "borrowed time" and "investment" concepts across adjacent sentences without added pressure, triggering −0.2 for loop and −0.4 for metaphor density in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (every detail serves setup or atmosphere), and the prose is clean. Minor artifacts: "credibly curious" (adverb + adjective construction feels slightly forced), "the slow majesty of something that had been waiting all day to be born" (elevated register), and light paraphrase in the second paragraph's atmospheric description ("temperature differentials were narrowing, the humidity climbing" closely mirrors "microclimate variations"). The test sequence propels clearly. No loops or scaffold, but figurative language in the final third ("rose like a dawn," "expanding waves," "borrowed warning") trends decorative without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraph two restates "spiritually curious nature" as "empathy" and "understanding"; paragraph four cycles "vulnerability," "exposed," "naked exposure," "vulnerable openness" across adjacent lines. Template cadence runs through "They believed," "They had learned," "They had discovered," "They understood" in paragraph three. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh texture: "swim through warm water," "light and loss," "death and seed." Filter-verb stacks ("they believed," "they understood," "they felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Figurative language in most sentences of paragraphs four and five lacks coherence (rainbows glimpse a story; vulnerability is "naked exposure"; empathy is "cultivated"). Information density is low; many lines restate prior claims without advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and free of major loops or template cadence. Sentences vary in structure and length, supporting the contemplative mood without stalling momentum. Minor issues: "weight of unspoken words" appears three times in slightly varied forms, risking synonym churn; "tranquilly perceptive" and "astonished recluse" are elevated constructions that border on over-writing for the stakes. The final paragraph's "eloquence of silence" and "unspoken words had found their keeper" lean abstract when a concrete image would land harder. No grammatical errors; information density is good, though some figurative language (moth wings, pools of amber) accumulates without causal pressure in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: paragraph four's "She thought about the person...thought about how time had failed...how strange it was" cycles through restatement without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in paragraph three: "She wrote...She wrote...She wrote" (−0.4). Figurative density in most sentences ("sand through fingers," "wounded birds," "fragmented promises of memory") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Total artifacts: −1.1, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density remains high without outright muddle, though the piece edges toward overwriting in peak beats: "seemed to hold captured twilight," "small miracle of construction," "burnished hush," "small scattered suns" stack within close proximity. Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "The way..." constructions across three consecutive sentences, creating rhythmic monotony (−0.4). A paraphrase loop occurs when "the incomplete opens itself to possibility" is immediately followed by "the next wounded thing that needs tending" and then "can still gesture toward the clouds, can still mean flight even when it cannot achieve it"—three variations on the same thematic assertion without added pressure (−0.3). Information density is high in the opening third but thins in the reflective closing, where scaffold phrasing ("the poet thought," "the poet did not feel") externalizes rather than inhabits.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and information-dense, with most lines advancing character, setting, or theme. However, template cadence weakens several beats: "The wire served a dual purpose: it provided... and it created..." follows outline logic. Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "encouraged the trees to channel their energy" restates "subtle conductivity" without added pressure. Register drift: "the great storms of the previous century," "the proper distribution of energy throughout the interconnected system" sound like museum placards rather than Maren's lived thought. The line "铜 wire" is a typographical error (Chinese character for copper embedded). One minor factual slip: "braze" instead of "blaze."

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn are present: "artificial pilgrimage she designed to process the unprocessable" echoed by "artificial pilgrimage she constructed for herself"; "homecoming" appears in nearly every paragraph with slight rewording but no added pressure. Template cadence: "She lifted… She thought… She carried… She walked…" in the final third. Stock metaphors: "frozen river of stone," "restless spirits," "lantern illuminating mysteries." Filter-verb stacks in reflective beats dull immediacy. Artifact penalty in Q7: baseline −0.8 for loops and cadence, plus −0.3 for stock strings. High-band entry for Q7 is blocked.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language—"wooden finger," "colossal beast," "battlefield of species"—but the density sometimes tips into overwriting, especially in the second paragraph's long explanatory clause about dead languages. "Fertilizeed" (typo) and "fertilization spell" adjacent to "fertilize" create minor churn. Template cadence appears in paragraph four: "Each seed pod he planted was… a single word in…" mirrors prior constructions. The opening and closing images anchor well, but mid-story scaffold ("This was a battlefield now, not of soldiers but of…") pauses momentum to explain rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language (wound, memory, bottled messages, seed metaphor) is vivid and mostly coherent, though "tinted revelations" in paragraph three feels like unexplained ornament. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph: "The riddle... resolved," "I sat... holding," "He had left... had searched" creates a slight drumbeat without payoff. No filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak in peak beats. Propulsion remains strong through the decoding sequence; the closure image is clear. Overall craft is solid with minor rhythmic uniformity at the end preventing higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    Heavy reflection dominates (~60% of text) with abstract phrasing: "liminal space," "echoed silence," "blessed pariah," "temporally stretched." Paraphrase loops appear: "the true north she had been seeking" recurs in varied synonyms across three paragraphs. Template cadence in the final paragraph stacks declarations without propulsion. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "understood") cluster in high-density beats, dulling immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but overwritten in stretches: "対齐towers" (an untranslated character), "ribbons of amber and bruise-purple," and "microhistories contained within like a cartographer charting underground rivers" pile figurative language without advancing pressure. The "Wait—I have miscounted" section is a paraphrase loop—the second telling covers identical ground with minor cuts, creating scaffold rather than momentum. Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("the sky was wrong," "the lid was small," "she had grown taller"). No filter-verb stacks, but the density of metaphor in the opening dulls propulsion. The final line ("stepped into the unknown with open arms") echoes the earlier phrase verbatim, reading as repetition rather than resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and middle sections. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "The way a stranger…The way a mother…The way an old man" constitutes a three-beat anaphora that reads ornamental rather than pattern-taught, and the final paragraph recycles "the small gestures, the unbound memories, the nomadic shadows" in list form without new pressure. Mixed metaphor: "luminous absence" recurs five times, diluting its charge. Figurative density in the final third (terrible light, fractured voices, acoustic curves) approaches overwriting without clear payoff. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.4, template cadence −0.5, figurative density without pattern-teaching −0.4, totaling approximately −1.3 within Q7's accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "digestive tract of knowledge," "seed beneath snow," "doorway" for reflections, "water finding its level." In the climax paragraph, metaphors stack without clear propulsion: "The buried talent rose like water... sharp and sudden, but it came paired with something... gratitude for having been given such gifts." Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "her grandmother speaking... her childhood home dissolving... her talent... buried beneath years." Paraphrase loops occur: "not a curse to be feared but a garden to be cultivated" restates the seed metaphor from two sentences prior. Information density is modest; many lines elaborate a single idea. The read-aloud test reveals syntactic monotony in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("amber of stopped time," "woven hush"). Information density is high in the opening. Minor scaffold: "The first drops of rain began to fall as the villagers slowly, hesitantly, began to move again" uses passive phrasing and hedging adverbs where sharper construction would tighten. The phrase "fidgets productively habit" in paragraph four is a typo or grammatical slip ("productively" should likely be "productive" or the sentence restructured). No major loops or template cadence, but closure paragraph compresses multiple beats (finishing tapestry, rising, understanding exile, forgiving self, walking) in summary fashion.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several phrases trend toward overwriting: "breath held too long," "careful lies," "forged hush of enforced silence" (where "forged hush" already implies enforcement). The phrase "something essential had been taken from her—not by force, but by her own willing surrender in exchange for belonging" is scaffold-like summary rather than embodied memory. "Stolen authority" and "stolen freedom" recycle the modifier. Clarity remains high and no loops obscure causality, but density could be tighter in the reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose carries high information density and vivid imagery ("copper hull," "quicksilver creature," "crater she could span with her thumb") but suffers from repeated scaffold phrasing and overwriting in peak beats. The kintsugi concept appears in three variants within one paragraph ("kintsugi intentions," "final act of kintsugi," "This was her kintsugi"), creating synonym churn. Template cadence runs through the scar-cataloging sequence: "The deep gouge... The cluster... The fine hairline fractures..." without variation. Mixed metaphors appear: "quilting memories through the language of scars" conflates textile and linguistic domains without coherent vehicle. The final paragraph stacks abstract philosophical claims ("negative space," "truth became visible") that dilute propulsion at closure. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems; −0.4 for figurative density in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmic, but several issues accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "the promise had tangled in his grief and become indistinguishable from regret" is restated as "his promise returned to him then, clear as the water." Template cadence runs through multiple "he had [verb]" constructions in the final third. Overwriting is present in stacked metaphors ("theater with no actors, colors faded to gray" followed immediately by "intimacy of someone who knew loneliness intimately"), and the closure beat itself carries figurative density ("monument to his grandmother's teaching") that slightly dulls immediacy. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but figurative density spikes without full payoff: "bruised clouds," "fever" stone, hearts "smooth[ed] like stones in a river," flares "like wounded stars," jasmine "bloomed outward like a confession," intent "like a blade of light through fog." Mixed metaphor appears in "screaming tenderness"—a charged oxymoron that works thematically but stretches coherence. The phrase "珍贵 as gold" drops untranslated Chinese mid-sentence, likely a generation artifact, breaking flow. Template cadence is minimal, but some stems repeat ("she had come," "she understood," "she thought"). Clarity and momentum hold, but overwriting in high-pressure beats (the sending of the vibration) dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening establishes mood and stakes cleanly. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (moon-phase clarity both trait and constraint). Minor scaffold appears in repeated syntactic stems: "Mara was…," "Mara understood…," "Mara walked…" across the middle third, creating a light template cadence. The final paragraph edges toward overwriting ("gleamed like the bronze censer foot") but remains legible. No loops or major opacity; propulsion is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong imagery ("mouth had become an open wound, bleeding sincerity"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: the orchard's persistence is restated three times across paragraphs without added pressure; "fractured but functional, damaged but directed" exemplifies synonym churn. Template cadence in reflection: "She remembered... She remembered... She had adapted..." Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, especially in non-peak beats. Information density is moderate; several paragraphs describe without advancing situation. The scaffold sentences lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and opening/closing lines anchor well, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "sleeping moon," "golden eye blinking," "tide marks on stone," "sea of uncertainty" cluster without space. The boutonnière discovery—"tiny folded paper concealed among the dried petals"—strains credulity (Aldric held it multiple times before noticing). Template cadence appears in the second paragraph: "What made this visitor different was... the way his eyes... and the sudden, urgent gesture..." A paraphrase loop occurs between "borrowing memories" explanation in paragraph one and "borrowed memories" method in paragraph two, restating without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with good rhythm variation and purposeful detail. Information density is high in most beats. However, several abstraction clusters reduce immediacy: "the sheer weight of maps passing through her hands," "the calm recognition," "magnetic weight of all the maps." The phrase "empirically intuitive" appears twice without concrete dramatization. Minor scaffold: "The paper remembered, and so did she" is evocative but slightly ornamental. No major loops or template cadence, and the final image "the blooming cavern held its breath" lands with strong specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes). However, several phrases drift into elevated diction that feels ornamental rather than pressure-driven: "lacy menace" appears once without payoff, "cobalt grotto above clouds" is stock atmospheric phrasing, and "mystery solved and purpose reclaimed" stacks abstractions at closure. Minor paraphrase loop: "bleeding starlight" is described twice in adjacent beats (dreams, then grotto ceiling) without added detail. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "capture presence"/"distill essence"/"hold secret" and "density accumulated through return"/"each encounter adding layers"/"moments pressed dense" restate the same idea across adjacent lines without added pressure (−0.8). Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [past-tense verb]" constructions. Register drift into corporate-academic diction ("accumulated heat," "threshold between day and night," "emotional weight of every tide") at peak beats (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "pocket-sun" borrows light yet also grows "cooler" as if it were thermal, violating its own logic (−0.3). Information density is low; many sentences perform thematic commentary rather than advancing scene or character.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high—most sentences layer image, interiority, and thematic charge—but figurative language clusters densely in peak beats without always clarifying. "Feral nostalgia rising in my chest like something wild and caged" mixes metaphor (feral/wild/caged overlap). The final paragraph stacks three poetic constructions in succession ("The mountain holds its breath. The cabin exhales its shadows. And somewhere...a bird sings"), creating rhythmic saturation. Paraphrase loops appear: "chaos into narrative" recurs in opening and closure without reweighting, and "jaded wonder" is named twice in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in the anaphoric close is purposeful but borders on over-patterning. No major scaffold or syntax errors, but register elevation and figurative density in high-pressure beats warrant deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing images anchor well ("bell above the door," "screw still warm in her hand"). Information density is high in early paragraphs. However, several artifacts accumulate: "reading between the lines" appears twice in identical phrasing (paragraphs 5 and 6), and paragraph nine contains paraphrase loops ("she understood now" repeated across three sentences). The phrase "The humanize through occluded views" is grammatically broken, obscuring meaning at a peak reflective beat. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph: "She had helped... She could not... She understood..." Stack of filter verbs ("could almost smell," "could not taste") clusters in a single beat without pattern payoff. Apply −0.6 for loops and template, −0.3 for the grammatical break, totaling −0.9.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears: "She had scarred herself learning to carve" followed by "The patterns on her palms were pale now" restates scar presence without new pressure. "Tears, sweat—they became small diamonds" and later "her crystallized essence becoming the ink" loop the crystallizing concept without escalating its function. Figurative density in the closure paragraph ("sheets of silver," "luminous and perfect," "language older than scholarship") stacks metaphor without muddle but trends decorative. No major loops or template cadence runs; rhythm varies and propulsion is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries strong specificity ("curvy vessel of violet glass with a faded gold label"). Two paraphrase slips: "the words had tangled in her throat like loosened strings" closely echoes the earlier "words felt like stones dropping into still water," creating minor redundancy in the apology beat. The final paragraph's "the particular ache of an apology delivered too late to matter and just in time to begin again" borders on over-explanation, slightly dulling the closure image's charge. Information density is high otherwise, with minimal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings show variety. Paraphrase loop across final two sentences: both describe simultaneous inward/outward movement using near-identical structure without added pressure (−0.4). Figurative density is high but consistent with lyric mode and taught early; no mixed metaphors. Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work without advancing choice or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "razor edges," "knife-edge," "temple to patience," "endless conversation," "stubborn insistence" cluster in nearly every paragraph, creating a decorative texture that sometimes obscures rather than sharpens. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs on clocks measuring "something more slippery" and "the space between breaths" restate the same idea across multiple sentences. Template cadence: "She had learned," "She was the only," "She thought about," "She understood" open successive beats. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (water seeking its level as both process and metaphor), but scaffold sentences slow momentum in the middle third. Applying cumulative artifact penalties: −0.6 for figurative saturation in peak beats, −0.4 for paraphrase loops, −0.3 for template stems = baseline ~7.1, reduced to 6.4.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The prose carries high information density and integrates action with reflection. However, several phrases trend toward the generic-literary: "amber quiet," "indifferent rhythms," "the shape of risk itself." The final paragraph's "addition of losses that might yet become multiplication of meaning" is metaphorically coherent but approaches overwriting at a peak beat. The "clover melancholy" descriptor in dialogue framing feels slightly ornamental. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong, but figurative density in the closure could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; lines frequently do double work (e.g., "a artery of concrete and copper beneath the city's veins" anchors setting and metaphor). Minor article error ("a artery") and one instance of near-paraphrase loop (harmonica described as "not quite music and not quite memory" echoes "neither quite glass nor crystal" structurally) create small drag. No major scaffold or template cadence, and figurative language is controlled and coherent, though density in the reflective middle risks slight momentum loss given the lack of on-page action to interleave.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high and figurative language is purposeful early on ("purple light bleed into the water like an old photograph developing"). However, the final two paragraphs accumulate metaphor density without clear escalation: "currency," "bridge," "shawl," "stitched together" crowd the closure beat, creating mild figurative muddle. Minor paraphrase loop: "preserve the weight of small moments" appears in paragraphs 2, 6, and 7 without material reweighting each time. Template cadence: "She had come," "She was gently," "She had learned," "She had been" creates repetitive sentence openings across paragraphs 1–5. Apply −0.6 for density at closure, −0.4 for loops and stems.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several passages loop conceptually: the explanation of reciprocity is stated, then restated in slightly different terms ("To cure loneliness, one had to recognize it..."). The phrase "improbable" appears three times in proximity, creating lexical repetition. The mid-story insertion of "愈合" (Chinese character) reads as a text artifact or encoding error. Some filter verbs ("thought of," "understood") dull immediacy in reflective passages. The final paragraph's sentence rhythm accelerates effectively, but earlier scaffolding ("This was how," "What few people understood") reads as expository framing rather than live perception.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and often vivid ("cool metal drink in the whispered histories," "tiny earthquakes of insect movement"), but sustained metaphor across most sentences of the opening risks overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. The phrase "quiet blaze" recurs three times, and "the pause of shifting constellations" appears twice, bordering on synonym churn. Sequential clarity falters in "Hours passed, or perhaps it was only minutes, for time moved strangely across the pause of shifting constellations"—the temporal vagueness is intentional but undercuts momentum. The final two paragraphs loop conceptually: "not a destination but a doorway," "truest navigation," and "architecture of her own soul" restate the epiphany without advancing it, and the closing sentence recaps the stillpoint's eternal patience, echoing prior claims.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong; information density is high in the signal-work passages. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: the pen's lack of ink is stated twice in close proximity ("no longer held ink" / "dried nib"), and "strange comfort" recurs across paragraphs without advancing pressure. Template cadence in reflective beats: "She had been assigned… She had learned… She did not mind…" creates a flat rhythm. Minor metaphor muddle: "folded into itself like origami made of radio waves" is vivid but the physics contradict (origami implies discrete folds; radio waves are continuous). These artifacts do not touch the closure beat but accumulate across the middle third. Apply −0.8 for distinct loop and template issues under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance image or emotion. Several loops appear: "silence" recurs seven times, "translate/translator/translating" eight times, with near-paraphrase in adjacent lines ("grief mapped in curves," "love folded into shapes"). The old man's dialogue ("You translate silence into music" / "to translate silence into music is to find the rhythm") reads as thematic echo rather than distinct speech. Template cadence in reflection blocks ("She thought of…and she understood…"; "The harbor seemed…the night itself had come…") flattens momentum mid-beat. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Opening sentence is vivid but overlong (49 words) and buries the lead. Paraphrase loops appear: "knowledge had been hoarded rather than shared" restates "fees to open" without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the Archive section ("She had been following...when she found," "she understood why," "she realized"). Stock metaphors: "thread tied around her heart," "burning bright enough to illuminate." Figurative density in the closure paragraph ("volcanic tenderness," "thread...promise...gates") muddies rather than sharpens the final image. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.4 for stock metaphor strings.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is often vivid ("vomiting stars," "liquid light") but density suffers from paraphrase loops: "The lagoon was breathing" is stated, then restated as "the lagoon pulsed under starlight." Template cadence appears in the second paragraph ("the harmonic ferns that sang... the bass moss that pulsed... the chiming orchids that required"). Mixed metaphor: "auric rings" and "liquid light" blur visual logic. Final third avoids major artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language (mycelium, sea-goat climbing upward) is controlled. Minor scaffold detected: "not with official symbols but with her own notation" and the adjacent explanation feel slightly redundant. "The key was different" as a paragraph opener is functional but template-like. One paraphrase loop: the key's uselessness is restated across two sentences without added pressure. The final image is clean. Overall strong but a few seams reduce propulsion slightly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm modulates purposefully, with longer reflective passages yielding to tight action beats ("The boy noticed. His head lifted"). Some scaffold persists: "She had learned" and "She understood" appear multiple times, creating template cadence in the opening third. Figurative language ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "stars that moved in spirals") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, though density in early paragraphs occasionally slows momentum. No loops touch the closure beat; the final image is clean and propulsive. Information density is high in action beats, lower in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "When parents asked... When teachers noticed... When they couldn't articulate..." (identical stems across three beats), "The point was the mother who... The teenager who... The elderly man who..." (parallel construction without pressure variation). Stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "forests of second thoughts," "seeds of wondering," "armor of certainty." Filter verbs stack in reflective passages ("She learned to cradle," "She taught them to cradle") without adding pressure. These artifacts reduce information density and dull momentum, particularly in the final third where closure should land. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7 for loops, stems, and stock phrasing that touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages loop or paraphrase. "She had guarded herself fiercely" and the following two sentences restate her armor-building without added pressure. "The scrimshaw had never unlocked anything. She had kept herself locked" is synonym churn. Template cadence appears: "not a demand... an invitation," "not to unlock others' hearts, but to unlock her own," "not through combat, but through surrender. Not by holding on, but by letting go." Stock metaphors cluster: "heart... opened like a flower," "the world could transform the tender into the terrible." Figurative density in the final third (bioluminescence, disappearing island, flower) crowds without clear pattern payoff. Minor pronoun ambiguity: "their violence become legend, their treasures become heirlooms" could briefly confuse antecedent. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs, −0.4 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings show range. Information density is high—most lines layer action, memory, and thematic weight. Minor loop: "This is my farmhouse…This is my hush…This is my grief" in the penultimate paragraph reads as purposeful parallelism (charging the ending) rather than paraphrase artifact. One instance of slight overwriting: "the hush was remade, you see. They remade all silences" could compress. Figurative language (turbines as "graceful and terrible," wood curls "like a falling thought") remains coherent and voice-motivated. No grammar, tense, or pronoun issues.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose demonstrates controlled rhythm and vivid figurative language ("winter light broke against the frozen lake like fractured glass scattered across silver water"). Clarity remains high with no pronoun confusion or tense slips. However, multiple beats loop conceptually: "boundaries dissolve" is paraphrased across columns two, three, and the ending without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section ("She approached...She stopped...She did not know"), and elevated diction in peak beats ("tremor of certainty" repeated thrice) creates minor register drift. Information density suffers from ornamental restatement where compression would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structures. Information density is high in the opening (phoenix, courtyard, Mira's history, the reed tongue) without feeling rushed. Two minor scaffold moments: "This was her gift and her burden" summarizes rather than trusts the prior image, and "anyone who would look closely enough" in the penultimate paragraph loops the lesson already dramatized. The phrase "bartered awakenings with the old harmonium player... trading three paintings of shadows" introduces a metaphor ("bartered awakenings") that recurs but remains slightly abstract—what "awakening" means as a tradable unit is never concretely anchored, relying on the reader to infer. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in "smoking phoenix" motif bookending (opening and near-end) without new work.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Some phrases border on overwriting without pattern-teaching ("powerfully gentle" appears twice, and constructions like "the texture of connection itself. Not the fact of connection...but its texture" loop conceptually). "Golden shadows" recurs across multiple beats, charged at the end with "liquid courage." Clarity remains strong throughout. Minor template cadence in the committee-explanation paragraph ("She began each design phase by asking..."). No significant loops or scaffolding, but the piece favors explanation over propulsion in several passages.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum generally strong; sentences advance character and atmosphere. "Hollowed out and scattered like crushed pearls" and "the bottom had no floor" are vivid. However, paraphrase loops appear: "mourning jewelry maker" recurs five times; "curtains of intention" appears four times in identical phrasing without pressure variation. Template cadence: "She had arrived... She collected... She descended... She approached... She touched..." clusters in adjacent paragraphs. Figurative density ("gossamer barriers," "starlight poured," "essence everywhere") is high but legible. No major artifacts touch closure, so cap non-closure deductions at −0.4 per accumulation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the card-spread passage, where systemic failure layers accumulate without bloat. Minor template echo: "She had known, of course—she always knew by the end of a reading—but hearing him speak the words aloud was part of the process, the confession that opened the way to understanding" contains two appositive clarifications in sequence, a small scaffold pattern. The phrase "inherited mystery" appears three times, risking synonym churn, though it functions as a motif. No major loops or muddles; clarity and propulsion hold.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several images are striking ("fractured shadows," "luminescent dust motes"). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy: the "atoms of nostalgia" concept is restated multiple times across paragraphs without adding pressure. Phrases like "terrible beauty, their capacity to wound even as they healed" and "burden and blessing" rely on stock oppositions. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("understanding," "purpose," "pursuit," "knowledge") that dull momentum. Template cadence appears in the repeated "I had learned / I understood / I felt" sentence stems.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm, supporting the contemplative accumulative design. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or thematic texture. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She understood this footage intimately because she had been the one to archive it, though she could not remember the archiving itself, only the afterward" restates the memory-gap concept already established. "She neither confirmed nor denied these rumors; she simply continued her softly deliberate work" adds minimal new pressure. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph ("She had always been sharp-eyed about dusk, about the moments when one thing became another, when the bound and unbound touched at their edges") stacks parallel clauses without clear propulsion. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template artifacts that dull momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high—most lines advance character state or thematic charge. Minor scaffold appears: "She picked up the tail tip, feeling its lightness" → "The tail tip's colors caught the starlight" recycles the object anchor unnecessarily. The final paragraph's "shimmering stillness, full of possibility and the patient understanding that all things shed their layers eventually" stacks abstractions where a single concrete image would sharpen. Figurative language (mist as breath, stars as salt, certainty as cage) remains coherent and serves the accumulative design. No loops or template cadence runs mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm, but several lines loop or restate: "more awake than she had ever been" after "anesthesia had worn off" paraphrases without added pressure, and "forgotten mug at the tunnel's entrance" / "each ring a date marker, each pattern a chapter" cycles through synonym variants. The frosted hourglass description appears three times with similar phrasing. Figurative density in the opening ("world held its breath like a child waiting for a thunderclap that never comes") is vivid but borders on overwriting for a post-anesthesia POV. Minor filter-verb stacking ("felt the displaced miracle… settling") slightly dulls immediacy. No major clarity breaks, but tightening would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("hum of unused love," "accumulating dust in the silence," "ghosts fumbling for form"). However, the piece exhibits template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She understood," "She saw," "She knew from experience" across multiple paragraphs. The phrase "spatially imaginative" recurs three times as a label without fresh action each time. The closure paragraph stacks summary clauses that restate theme rather than trusting the prior image. Information density is high in the vision sequences but dulls in the frame passages.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors recurring in nearly every sentence ("remembered stardust," "unwritten calendar," "shadowed rapture," "moonstruck dreamer"). Paraphrase loops are pervasive: paragraphs two and five both restate that she has been struggling and that stardust is dormant. Template cadence appears in the opening of paragraphs ("She had been," "She had tried," "She had spent"). The final paragraph stacks declarations without propulsion: "thank it, to thank her grandmother, to thank the remembered stardust itself." Register drift into elevated lyricism ("shadowed rapture," "aurora-scented air") clashes with the plain stakes. Sentence rhythm is often uniform, lacking the varied propulsion expected at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-motivated ("phosphorescent note," "possibilities that had never collapsed"). One mixed metaphor: "fold in the landscape where the light bent wrong" followed by "fold of light"—the vehicle shifts from topography to illumination without clear linkage. The phrase "祈愿" (appears untranslated, likely a generation artifact or intentional code-switch) disrupts flow without payoff. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Propulsion is steady; the piece breathes appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled—no mixed metaphors. However, template cadence appears in paired constructions: "like a farewell, like a beginning, like the sound of..." and "was here, was everywhere, was the space between..." create a lyric drumbeat that flattens propulsion in the final paragraph. Paraphrase loop: "questions themselves had grown teeth" and "questions...humming with the frequency" restate the same animating conceit without added pressure. Information density is high in setting but lower in action beats; the unraveling of the tangle occupies three sentences of passive description ("vines withdrew," "springs unspooled") where causal agency would sharpen momentum. No significant clarity breaks, but the closure beat is cushioned by ornament rather than propelled.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "light began its slow surrender," "bones of the heart," "shed skin," "cotton and shadow." In the opening paragraph alone, three metaphors compress into two sentences, risking overwriting without clear payoff until the leash-release beat. Paraphrase loop in paragraph four: "courage was not something one gathered" followed immediately by "courage...waited in the places one refused to go" restates rather than advances. Template cadence: "the woman rose...and she felt" / "They began...and she recognized" / "She took...and she walked" creates rhythmic predictability. Information density is moderate; several beats (guides' centuries of farewells, the route's looping indirection) describe rather than constrain choice until the crest.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively; sensory detail is vivid ("green with oxidation yet somehow bright"). However, multiple sentences loop or restate without added pressure: "he did not know if he believed that, but he believed in the bolt's weight" restates the prior clause's idea. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "had remained when he could have fled, had seen when he could have looked away" is purposeful parallelism, but earlier scaffold—"not a vision. Not a miracle. Just evidence"—feels rhythmically mechanical. Figurative density in the final paragraph (snow as notes, fortress settling, heart thawing) clusters without clear pattern-teaching, per the overwriting check (−0.4 to −0.6 range).

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is polished and carries vivid images ("sun-bleached murals were old acquaintances rather than ruins"). However, heavy overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening paragraph stacks figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff ("knowledge slumbered," "dust motes drifted like memories," "readers long turned to bone and name"). Template cadence in the third paragraph: repeated "she" sentence openers and parallel structures. Paraphrase loop: "pretender to the throne" / "fraud...slipped into power through deception" restate the same content. Deductions: density overload −0.5, template cadence −0.4, paraphrase −0.2; total −1.1. Additionally, the opening two paragraphs are scaffold that delay plot entry without creating immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Clarity is excellent; no loops, paraphrase cycles, or template cadence runs detected. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "cemetery of living structures," "photographs of temporary truths," "breath held and released." Minor density slip: the third paragraph's exposition on tapping rhythms ("Three short taps for temperature...") reads slightly scaffolded, summarizing rather than showing the practice in action earlier. Grammar and usage are clean; pronoun references unambiguous. Strategic telling compresses transit ("after the ban," "seven years") efficiently. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong sensory anchoring ("toes curling against the cold metal floor," "vibrating through the metal grates"). Information density is good; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Two frictions lower the score: (1) "The hum of the ancient stone circle grew stronger" / "The stones rose around her" / "the hum move through her" / "The hum shifted"—four variations on the hum's presence within adjacent beats, edging toward synonym churn. (2) "awkwardly confident" appears three times in similar constructions, creating a template cadence around that trait. No paraphrase loops touch the closure beat, so deduction is contained.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor scaffold appears: "the old woman heard the plants… rise up in a chorus" and "Yara felt the plants calm around her, their message complete" are near-paraphrases of the same receptive beat. The phrase "implanted destinies" in Anya's dialogue and "genetic script and ancient wisdom" at closure risk elevated register outside lived speech. No severe loops or artifacts touch the closure image directly, but cumulative minor slips (−0.6 for template phrasing and register drift in peak beats) lower the band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions (greenhouse repair = character trait + setting + stake). Rhythm varies naturally, and the opening anchors voice and frame effectively. Minor pattern emerges in mid-story with repeated "she" + past-tense verb stems across several paragraphs, creating brief template cadence. The phrase "somatic markers of the present" and "nervous system doing what it needed to do" edge toward clinical register that slightly flattens immediacy in peak trauma beats. No loops or major scaffold; figurative language (phantom limbs, pearl of stillness) is coherent and sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; no major loops. Information density is strong in the card-untangling sequence. However, the piece carries figurative language in nearly every high-pressure beat without teaching a lyric pattern that would justify the density: "ghost prints," "watercolors bleeding," "threads woven from light and memory," "luminescence of her aching clarity." The final paragraph's "somewhere smaller to find something larger" and "no longer needed fixing" feel slightly scaffolded. Register is consistent with the mystical-realist frame, but the accumulation of metaphor in the descent scene (light "softer," darkness "necessary, not empty but full") slightly dulls propulsion. Proofreading is clean; no grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but momentum suffers from overwriting and scaffold. The opening sentence runs 28 words with nested qualifiers; similar constructions recur throughout. Figurative language appears densely without pattern-teaching: "cold fire that burned without flame," "time moved like honey," "ancient silence, waiting." Several passages contain paraphrase loops—the ink's nature is described multiple times across paragraphs two and three without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears: "He understood now that..." (twice), "The tracker noticed/felt/understood" (four instances). Information density is moderate; many sentences do atmospheric work but don't advance plot. The final sentence runs 130+ words, creating a breathless catalogue effect rather than propulsive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are not monotonous. Information density is moderate—many lines advance atmosphere and interiority, though some restate without added pressure (paragraphs 3 and 4 loop on the letter's weight and Kira's trembling). No egregious template cadence, but the prose leans on elevated metaphor clusters that blur momentum: "pocket of silence," "stones dropped into a frozen well," "each sentence a small apocalypse," "rot in ice." Figurative density is high across most beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, edging toward overwriting (−0.4). One paraphrase loop: "the weight of the revelation pressed against her chest" echoes "that dizzying quiet pressed against her thoughts" (−0.2). Grammar and clarity are clean; no significant loops in the closure beat. Overall, the piece is legible but carries scaffold that dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops in the final two paragraphs: "her work mattered" → "weaving continuity through chaos" → "to tend what could be saved" all restate the same thesis with synonym variation. The phrase "engraved quiet where the weight of sand had pressed silence into every fiber" mixes metaphor (engraving requires a tool; pressing creates compression, not engraving). Template cadence appears in "She was...," "She had...," "She simply..." constructions. Figurative density is high but occasionally overwrought ("fever," "thunder that never broke into rain").

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated description. In the climax, "sound that was also a color, a grief that was also a bell" and "absence of every sound that had ever hurt him" pile abstractions where a single concrete image might land harder. Some template patterns: "He would have to... He would have to..." and repeated "The [noun] [verbed]" constructions. Information density is strong, with most lines advancing atmosphere and stakes. Clarity holds, but the prose works hard for its effects rather than achieving effortless propulsion, and some phrases ("visible vibrations," "transliterate") repeat their core idea.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is largely polished with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high in the backstory compression (three generations summarized efficiently). However, paraphrase loops appear: "the journalist had been used as a weapon, fed half-truths designed to make her look guilty" restates the sabotage insight without added pressure. "Orbits of regret" appears four times, risking echo without evolution. The "rosewood pen nib" is introduced twice in the opening with near-identical framing. Minor template cadence in the ancestry list ("Her great-grandfather had killed... Her grandfather had suppressed... Her father had buried...") is purposeful parallelism, not artifact. Figurative density in the opening (smoke, whales, stars) is high but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "something more desperate and something less," "the ability to hear what the dead had tried to say, to translate the unspeakable communications"; "not as a ghost or a memory, but as a current"; "not accusations but instructions." Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: firmware in an insect trapped for millions of years yet "dated to the night her sister had died" collapses physical logic. Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the closure beat ("meteor hush," "stars of redemption," "firmament of her broken timeline") without pattern-teaching flattens propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure directly, triggering the cap and preventing 9+ eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety is strong, rhythm breathes with scene needs, information density is high. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the unlearning motif. Minor overwriting in two stretches: "not blocking sound but clarifying it" and "something that had been unlearning began, gently, to learn" hedge toward eloquent summary rather than image. One paraphrase loop: "not as performance but as permission" echoes the prior "not despite impermanence but because of it" construction within a few lines. No template cadence, clear grammar, no filter stacks. These are hairline issues that keep it shy of 8.5+ but leave the closure image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing character or atmosphere. The opening ("moved through the smoke-tinged dawn like water finding its path") establishes voice and stakes efficiently. However, several artifacts dull momentum: "This was mercy, though it would look like madness" and "This was the old art" employ stock declarative phrasing; "The patterns spoke in the tongue of the old builders" and "encoded in the tessellation" loop the concept of encoded meaning without adding new detail. The phrase "allowing a single shaft of light to pierce through" contains the intrusive Chinese character "允许," a clear generation error that breaks immersion in the final paragraph. Filter-verb reliance ("she recognized," "she understood") is present but not pervasive. Figurative language is dense ("arms of steel," "ember," "water finding its path") without being taught as a pattern, which risks overwriting in a piece this short, though most images remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies sentence-to-sentence; no template cadence or loops. Information density is moderate—each paragraph advances setting or reflection—but phrases like "threshold place where the edges of reality wore thin," "tapestry of might-have-been," and "the infinite web of connection" stack figurative language without concrete anchors. "The ghost raised the tarot coin, and its painted surface began to produce echoes" repeats "echoes" across adjacent lines without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stack ("seemed to shift," "seemed to dance") in mid-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally controlled. Paraphrase loops appear: "The crystal seemed to catch the ambient light differently… its internal facets gleaming" / "The geode's internal structure caught the RGB lights, refracting them into fractal patterns" restates without adding pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the second paragraph: multiple "The [noun] had [verb]" and "she'd [verb]" stems across five sentences (−0.4). Stock metaphor strings in the climax ("delicate, luminous threads," "fragile hope") trend generic (−0.3). Cumulative artifacts in Q7: −0.9. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting total penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is vivid, but the piece exhibits template cadence in the final paragraph: parallel declarations ("a fact that had become legend, a legend that was actually memory, a memory that Maren would carry forward") that loop conceptually without advancing pressure. The opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor figurative muddle: "the bioluminescent algae pulsing soft green along the cavern walls like a living map指引她前行" includes an untranslated Chinese phrase that reads as a generation artifact. Paraphrase loop in the final beat: "float in its hidden waters" echoes the earlier tidal-pool float without added detail or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and sensory anchors are concrete ("calloused fingers," "worn surface"). The piece suffers from paraphrase loops: paragraph four's "worked quietly inspired" echoes adjacent reflection, and the final paragraph restates theme across three clauses. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph ("not a document… but a living system, a way for prophecy to breathe"). Filter verbs ("could sense," "could feel") stack in paragraph four without voice motivation. Information density is moderate; scaffolding phrases ("what emerged was") slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual pacing, but several metaphors stack without clear vehicle logic: "silver and silent" mist, courage "folded into itself like a letter never opened," mist that "brightens" as if "acknowledging spring." The phrase "during her convalescence in a basement that smelled of mold and regret" mixes concrete and abstract registers. The pillbox is described as "engraved" and "etched" in adjacent sentences (paraphrase loop). Filter verbs ("felt something ancient and vital stir") dull immediacy at a peak beat. Minor artifacts reduce density but do not obscure closure. Apply −0.6 for stacked figurative language and paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the piece exhibits scaffold and template artifacts: "closely attentive eyes," "spindrift serenity," "palimpsest promise" appear as poetic labels without being dramatized in action; several sentences loop thematically (distillation, carrying forward, simplicity/essence) without advancing pressure. The phrase "ambient awareness of the crossing—its moods, its secrets, its quiet revelations—the true meaning had percolated" stacks abstractions. Figurative language is dense in reflective passages without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Apply −0.8 for loops and label-stack in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("clay remembered everything," "smoke… like a sigh," "timelines stacked like plates in a kiln") and occasionally risks overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff—most metaphors are craft-adjacent but cluster heavily in contemplative beats. Paraphrase loop in paragraph four: "The answer… was not in the land… but in the accumulated kindness" restates the theme already implied. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph ("would take… would set… would let"), reducing propulsion. Sentence openings vary; no clarity breaks. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, others linger.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (petal as "small,红色叹息" [red sigh], "harbor sang its quivering hush") is vivid but occasionally dense without payoff. The Chinese phrase disrupts register and reads as a generation artifact. Minor scaffold appears: "she had stopped crying" directly after "The girl was quiet, but she had stopped crying" creates a paraphrase loop. Sentence openings vary, but some constructions feel template-driven ("The harbor stretched," "The sound reminded"). Information density is high, yet peak beats carry decorative metaphor that slows momentum rather than sharpening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structure. However, the piece carries patterned artifacts: synonym loops ("coexistence" / "coexisted" across paragraphs), template cadence in reflective blocks, and metaphor density that occasionally muddles clarity ("a frequency, a channel," "brittle awakenings had not been breaks in her sanity but dawnings in her soul"). The closure paragraph stacks figurative language without breathing room. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is moderate; some reflective passages circle without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished with rhythm variation and strong images. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "rejoin what they had lost, bridging silences" / "rejoining what the storm had scattered"; "thread" recurs six times across adjacent paragraphs without pattern-taught purpose. "分离ations" is a typographical artifact (Chinese character mid-word). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; the Nautilus metaphor and "second sky" work. Template openings ("She thought about," "She would build," "She stayed") flatten momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is adequate and no major loops appear, but several lines restate without adding pressure: "The community divide spreading across campus was not organic—it was engineered, harvested, a crop of chaos being cultivated" cycles through three synonyms for the same idea. Template cadence surfaces in paragraph four: "She understood now... The protests, the polarized student councils, the fractured friendships: all of it could be traced back..." Figurative language clusters in paragraph five ("ethereal grit... settled into her bones like a second skeleton," "margins of charts that had never been designed for this purpose") without clear payoff. Sentence rhythm varies adequately but information density sags in expository middle paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("spatial mutiny," "impossible geometry," "origami made of shadow and silence") within the second paragraph, though none obscure clarity. The phrase "prudently adventurous" and "spatial mutiny" feel slightly forced as concept-labels. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected; the final paragraph's thematic summary ("rebellion not against any enemy...") adds slight redundancy but doesn't break momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sensory anchors are strong ("stiffened silk like preserved skin," "stone faces cut into the hillside"). However, multiple paraphrase loops and template stems flatten momentum: "She searched for... She searched for...," "The portrait would go... Elena would not solve... But she would awaken..." The verb "lance" is used twice in different contexts (police "lance through piles," Elena will "lance through the fog"), creating figurative muddle. The final paragraph recycles diction ("methodical," "fragment," "shadowed") without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing images frame the arc purposefully. Grammar and tense remain consistent. However, multiple line-level patterns drain momentum: paraphrase loops recur (e.g., "the nail's presence had driven her toward maps, toward the hope that geography might explain" immediately followed by "Now, at thirty-four, she finally had access"), template cadence appears in the journal-decoding sequence ("The journals were… but Maren had… and the coded stanzas yielded"), and filter-verb stacks ("understood," "thought," "felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Stock metaphors populate key moments: "spongey dread," "voices deliberately silenced," "screaming through the gaps." The closure beat—"rose from her chair with the nervously confident stride"—tells rather than shows the stance shift. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 for loops and template cadence distributed across beats, escalated to −1.2 because filter verbs cluster in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative language is vivid but dense to the point of overwriting: "scaffold netting… snapped in wind like the wings of enormous, anxious birds," "pixels of color that reassembled into an image… like a ghost photograph learning to breathe," "the road unwound before her like a song that had never learned to end." Three extended similes in the final third create rhythm drag (−0.5). The phrase "溶解ed" (a mixed-script typo) breaks copy consistency (−0.2). Paraphrase loops appear: "the possibility of return—not to what was, but to what might have been" and "proof that even the ashes of 'never' could be sculpted into something that breathed and shifted" restate the same thematic claim across adjacent beats (−0.3). Information density is high, but scaffold phrasing ("she would later call it," "she understood then") externalizes insight rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is mostly clear, but several paraphrase loops appear: "abandoned circus train" recurs without variation, and the "dusky harmony" metaphor is restated three times with minimal progression. Template cadence emerges in the backstory summary ("Marcus had carried both into the world…where he applied his inherited wisdom") and in expository beats that narrate rather than dramatize key turns. The final paragraph's rhythm ("growing dim and peaceful…still marking its territory") is effective, but earlier beats carry scaffolding that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied syntax, but several beats loop conceptually: paragraph three restates "understood" multiple times; paragraph four paraphrases "dreams had always been different" in adjacent clauses. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph ("not to solve...but to share," "not from answers...but from"). Stock metaphors (stars "spoke in languages," "tide of recognition") appear frequently without fresh inflection. The closing lines summarize rather than propel, and figurative density ("healing words," "burden of revelation") in the final third obscures concrete action. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence; cap at 8.7 per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high; most lines advance situation or atmosphere. The piece avoids major loops, though "what mirrors don't show" / "What mirrors didn't show" recurs with functional variation. Figurative language ("confession made solid," "unbent the rigid structure of his own shame") is dense but mostly coherent. One typographical artifact (動作) in "his動作 deliberate" breaks immersion. Minor register drift occurs when abstract philosophical phrasing ("discovering truth meant first losing your grip on illusion") intrudes in the final paragraphs. Opening and closing images are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but repetitive phrasing appears: "the future had arrived early" opens two paragraphs, and "she had learned" / "she had felt" / "she had waited" stems recur across backstory blocks. Minor article slip: "a illumination" should be "an illumination." Figurative language is dense—"tendrils of awareness," "veil between the possible and the impossible"—and occasionally stacks without clear propulsion in peak beats. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the scaffold of past-perfect constructions flattens momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or stakes. However, multiple prose artifacts cluster in key beats: "fiercely gentle" / "fierce gentleness" / "dusky resolve" recur as label-phrases without fresh embodiment (−0.4). The phrase "the realm between, where spirits lingered in orchards such as this one" is expository scaffolding mid-beat (−0.3). Metaphoric density is high without pattern-teaching—almost every sentence carries figurative weight, which blurs clarity in the barter scene where concrete causality would sharpen the transaction (−0.4). The closure paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("currencies of being," "architecture of being," "impossible calculus") that obscure rather than clarify the final reweighting (−0.5, touching closure).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high in the opening and appraisal paragraphs, each line advancing character or situation. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold: "confident uncertainty" appears three times with slight variations, "echo valley longing" recurs without evolving meaning, and the phrase "insulating emotionally with facts" is explicitly restated. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "couldn't face another venue, couldn't face another amplification, couldn't face the absence." The final paragraph's metaphoric density ("deep as the silence between songs," "sound never truly disappears") stacks figurative language in adjacent sentences without clear propulsion, slowing momentum at closure. These artifacts pervade enough to trigger the −0.6 to −1.4 penalty range in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is largely clear and rhythmically varied, but paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear in adjacent lines: "the act of understanding, for the moment when chaos resolved into meaning" recycles the same concept. Template cadence runs in the reflective passage ("She thought of cuneiform… She thought of her own ambitions… She thought of the tree…"). The closure beat leans on abstract phrasing ("suspended in perpetual becoming," "the transition itself felt like coming home") that softens concreteness. Overall deduction −0.8 for loops and template stems in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent (water as migration metaphor, gears as continuity, wintersun as permanence), but it pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting. Several lines loop conceptually: "migrating identities" vs. "identities that came seeking preservation," "accepting contradictions" vs. "your contradictions will be accepted." Template cadence appears in the welcoming script ("here, you may rest; here, you may change; here, your contradictions...") which repeats verbatim across paragraphs. The final third recycles the opening's phrasing without tightening, dulling momentum. No clarity break at closure, but pervasive synonym churn and paraphrase loops lower density.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity is generally strong; propulsion varies. Opening rhythm is confident ("seventeen doomsday bunkers in her twelve years"), but the piece accumulates some figurative density without always advancing pressure: "cathedral of crystal," "small, contained sun waiting to be born," "heartbeat of a hesitation that had lasted forever and no time at all." The pearl/hope mechanics are told more than shown ("acquiring abandoned hopes, drawing them into itself"). Minor paraphrase loop: "confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral" appears twice in close succession without added detail. One template stem run: "She had spent...she had forgotten...she would file...she would also send" stacks filter constructions across the penultimate paragraph. No major loops or scaffold, but mid-range density and a few stock metaphors ("crack in her chest") lower momentum at peak beats. The final sentence is strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong figurative language: "green veins," "palimpsest of repairs," "stones dropped into still water." Rhythm varies purposefully. Information density high in the graffiti-discovery beat. Minor issues: some paraphrase loops ("she had blamed herself for the breakdown, for the voices...for the way she had lost weeks" recycles structure) and a few filter-verb stacks ("she had learned," "she had sought," "she had imagined") in reflective passages. The typo "allude[d]" and a slight template cadence in the grandfather-backstory paragraph ("He had played...through his own darkness, through the loss...through the lean years") cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraphs 4–5: "time...did not flow—it folded" is immediately restated as "propagation delays...were part of the cipher itself" without added pressure. Template cadence runs through paragraph 6: "She understood now...The watch was not merely...but a key" stacks filter constructions. Abstract nominalizations ("cautious optimism and wild hope," "cyclically reversed nature") replace concrete action verbs in high beats. Overwriting pervades: "flower made of pure language" and "every word that had died on desperate tongues" pile figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.7). The closure beat suffers from this density, triggering the artifact-touching-closure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift effectively. However, figurative density is high throughout ("secret wanting to be told," "promises losing their glow," "green breath," "ice violin sang of everything") without pattern-teaching or cost differentiation; this registers as mild overwriting (−0.4). Two paraphrase loops: "perforated with gaps… punched holes through" and "fading… losing their glow" (−0.2). Minor scaffold in "she had learned to listen without flinching, to receive without questioning why." Information density is strong; propulsion is present but occasionally dulled by metaphor stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is polished but overwritten in places: "threshold of stillness" appears six times, often in similar phrasing ("suspended in the threshold," "the threshold of stillness relaxed"). Sentence openings show variation, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction. "Radiant hush" and "luminously preserved" edge toward purple without earning the charge. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but scaffolding like "She had learned to see" and "She had never spoken of these visions" could be cut. Template cadence in the middle paragraphs (repeated "The X [verb]" stems) lowers momentum slightly. No severe loops, but the recurrence of "threshold of stillness" and "emerald chip" without variation constitutes mild churn. Apply −0.6 for density and scaffold, −0.3 for mild loop.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. Opening anchors effectively; final image recycles the hairpin with reweighted meaning. However, the piece contains light paraphrase loops: "contentment was not a destination. It was the cycle itself. The tending was the point. The caring was the reward" restates the same insight across four sentences without added pressure (−0.3). "The moment-to-moment work of nurturing what could not nurture itself—that was the source" repeats the pattern. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally stacks ("vineyard hush," "golden light," "quiet fullness") without clear pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative language is dense but coherent ("wind catching the edges of her coat like willing wings," "hollow mirror shard"). However, several beats loop paraphrase: the cloak-of-doubt concept is restated three times without adding pressure, and "sincerely insincere" appears twice as label rather than dramatized contradiction. The final paragraph stacks poetic abstractions ("fragile dawn," "questions came to find their answers") that blur momentum. Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift, but information density drops in reflective stretches. Apply paraphrase-loop and minor scaffold penalties totaling approximately −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, revelation, or character. Two artifacts touch pressure beats: "someone who had lived long enough to understand that growing younger was just another word for returning" is a paraphrase loop (growing younger = returning restated without added meaning), and "truth woven carefully / truth withholds itself / truths could only be taught" recycles the same conceptual claim across three moments, creating synonym churn around the core thesis. The closure paragraph stacks filter constructions ("understood," "knowing") that slightly dull immediacy. Otherwise, prose is controlled and vivid with strong concrete anchors ("smooth as worry, dark as the space between stars").

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic with high information density. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had not moved from this place in so long that the dust had learned her shape" is echoed by "her body had grown stiff and ancient in its stillness." Template cadence runs in the fourth paragraph ("When they spiraled… When they scattered… When they flew…") without taught payoff, triggering −0.4. Stock metaphors ("like the ribs of some fallen god," "thin across the canyon") lack fresh particularity. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats; figurative language remains coherent. Applying paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties totaling −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies (short "Then the mist began" follows longer setup), and imagery is specific ("synthetic packing moss," "carved stone"). Clarity holds across beats. However, minor loops appear: "forgotten things are beautiful, dimmed by time but not extinguished" and "brilliant dimness...paradox of light that illuminated precisely because it acknowledged its own approaching absence" restate the same idea within adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in para 2: "The crate...was small...lay a garden folly keystone...seemed absurdly out of place." Apply −0.4 for paraphrase/stem repetition per the Loop/Scaffold Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lyric and often vivid ("amber and rose," "saffron and violet threads"), but overwriting clusters in key beats. "Luminous vow," "luminescence in the dark," "meteor hush" recur as motif but also as crutch—synonym churn around light/promise/silence creates subtle loops. Figurative density is high: "fingerprints on the world," "light that refused to go out," "messages in bottles made of fire." Some metaphors strain: "vows luminescence" (verb use unclear), "signified his father's vow by living it" (diction elevates past the POV's idiom in peak clarity moment). Template cadence appears in paired "he had" constructions (paragraph two). The final paragraph stacks abstraction ("the kind of man who wandered purposefully") where a concrete image would land harder. Paraphrase loops: paragraphs five and six both explain that discovery requires patience rather than effort.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several instances of paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "quietly enthusiastic" appears twice; "patient" recurs without reweighting; "the static" and "static bursts" cycle through multiple near-identical constructions. Template cadence in reflection passages: "She believed...," "She had learned...," "She would..." The metaphor of "wavelength" is overextended without coherent vehicle logic. Figurative density is high but some images muddle (purpose "隐藏 itself from those who sought it too loudly" mixes registers).

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; no template runs. Information density is high (each image does multiple jobs—light scatters, monsters settle, grief crystallizes). Minor scaffold appears: "she felt" and "she understood" recur across paragraphs, creating slight filter-verb stacking. "Scattered light" appears three times in similar constructions, edging toward loop. The phrase "something that was not quite a heart but was enough" is strong, but adjacent lines ("she felt the weight... she also felt something else") paraphrase emotion without added pressure. Closure beat remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character, action, or atmosphere. However, template cadence and synonym churn appear: "The mage was earnestly naive enough...and wise enough" mirrors earlier "too weak...too much...What it needed"; "modest and persistent" recurs three times in the final third without functional variation. The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "steady application of something modest and persistent, exactly as the dripping rates had taught him" restates the repair method already shown. Stock metaphors ("hollow eyes," "chest ache with purpose") and elevated diction in a few beats ("belied," "cosmic") slightly jar the established voice. Apply −0.6 for template runs and loops; −0.3 for stock phrases. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is varied and sentences generally advance, but several artifacts cluster in peak beats. "快照" (Chinese for snapshot) appears mid-sentence—likely a generation artifact that breaks immersion. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "She understood… to ensure… to replace… She understood…" recycles stems. The phrase "she spin stories into shared meaning" contains a verb-tense error ("spin" for "spun"). Mixed metaphor: the reservoir "held its breath" but also "spoke in a language"—breath-holding precludes speaking. These line-level issues dull clarity in high-pressure moments and disqualify 9+ globally per the filter-verb/template-cadence rule.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.1)
    Density is high but marred by paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the reconciliation theme with synonym churn: "balance what she knew with what she felt," "liminal space between knowledge and wonder," "logic leaned toward intuition," "measurement and mystery," "formula and faith," "what could be proven and what simply was." These loops dull momentum and flatten the closure beat. Figurative language is pervasive without clear pattern-teaching, and some metaphors blur ("crystal became a living thing that pulsed with impossible light, a bridge"). Several lines use similar stems ("The crystal represented," "The birds moved," "The starlings wheeled"), creating rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and several images are sharp: "sunlight through breaking fog," "anvil lit by moonlight on one side and dark as coal on the other." However, paraphrase loops accumulate: "could observe… could track… could see… but could not reach… could not warn… could not do anything" and later "could see… could track… could guide… but could not fly… could not share… could only observe." Template cadence ("This was my domain," "This was the weight," "This was how I preserved") and the repetitive "watcher's burden" phrasing flatten momentum. The loops touch the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact penalty and 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "They felt everything. I felt nothing" is restated as "They had not experienced the death… They felt everything" within adjacent paragraphs. The final third deploys template openings ("The ego death had been," "The numbness remained," "The floating rock dojo settled") and summary constructions that dull propulsion. The blade's metaphoric work (cuts "membrane between imitation and authenticity") mixes vehicles without concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "unspoken grief," "unspoken sorrow," "unspoken" recurs without reweighting; "macerate the stillness," "macerated the stillness" repeats the same concept. Template cadence runs: "He did not rush. Mourning required..." / "He moved through..." / "He pulled the cord again..." Figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching: "echo chamber tunnel," "symphony conductor," "mechanical resurrection," "acoustic memory" blur into abstraction. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.0) and clarity drag across high-pressure beats (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("honey through gauze," "breath held and released," "opium and ash," "silver becoming brightness"), creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "not a prison but a threshold, not a prison but a generous waiting room, not a prison but a friend" repeats structure without adding pressure. Template cadence runs across multiple beats ("the mist that was also clarity," "a home that was also a journey"). Multiple metaphors within single sentences muddle rather than sharpen ("veil of sleep that was also waking, through the boundaries of light that were also darkness"). Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("the quiet grief of being untethered") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong imagery ("constellation of dying coals," "crimson flowers against the darkness"), and information density is high in the opening and climactic beats. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "did not need kindling but catalyst, did not require addition but subtraction, did not seek preservation but release" appears twice with only slight variation, and "neither gentle nor violent but simply inevitable" / "not hope, exactly, but its cousin, its shadow" deploy the same syntactic template. The final paragraph stacks summary clauses ("had created destruction and destroyed creation, had unmade and made anew") that restate the closure effect instead of trusting the image, flattening momentum at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the sensation of the universe itself beginning, over and over, in every moment of ending" is immediately echoed by "the fundamental rhythm that governed all things—the way darkness contained light, the way death nurtured growth, the way every farewell carried within it the seed of a new hello." This three-line restatement of the same cosmic insight dulls the closure beat. The phrase "serenely electric" is introduced twice with minimal added meaning, and "shard of hush" recurs without functional variation. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in the climactic paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the opening paragraphs. However, paraphrase loops appear: "permanent transience" / "permanent transient" and "made peace with" recurs without reweighting. The peak beat—"she felt the universe shudder and sigh as the impossible merger began to hold"—stacks abstract nominalizations ("impossible merger," "nexus," "intersection point") that obscure concrete action. Template cadence in paragraph 4: "She had learned…She had learned…" Apply −0.6 for loops and figurative muddle in the closure beat, and −0.2 for the stack of weak nominalizations that dull propulsion at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer action, interiority, and thematic charge. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the weaving sequence and slowing at closure. Minor template cadence appears in paragraph three: "She believed...The fever dreams she architectured...to see the seams..." uses similar declarative stems without pattern-teaching, costing ~−0.3. Figurative language (phosphorescence, spiraling helix, translucent overlays) remains coherent and grounded. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Propulsion is strong except for one expository stretch on rational enchantment that could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or stake without padding. However, several phrases loop or restate without added pressure: "the universe had suddenly grown so much larger" echoes the opening's "horizons that no human calculation had ever predicted," and "invisible threads" / "invisible pathways" / "patient journey" form a cluster of near-synonyms. The phrase "the technique involved understanding" slips into expository scaffolding. The final paragraph's "hold steady against the infinite, to expand into the unfolded horizons" stacks abstractions where a concrete image would sharpen closure. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template phrasing in non-closure beats; no artifact touches the final image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm is controlled and several images are vivid ("shadows pooled like spilled ink," "pulse, soft as moth wings against glass"). However, repeated template stems appear: "Elena had seen…," "Elena had been hired…," "Elena understood…" The phrase "the reel of hush that settled" is opaque. The final paragraph loops concepts ("threads," "tracing," "calling," "heard") without propelling new information. Density is uneven, with some beats doing double duty and others restating.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies appropriately and information density is generally high. However, the piece shows several minor artifacts: "warmth beneath her fingertips" (verb form error—should be "warm"), "standing by the unremembered" repeats as both concept and phrase, and the closing sentence stacks three metaphoric vehicles without full integration ("prison," "library," "learned to read"). The Template-cadence check flags the repeated "Maren [verb]" constructions in the final third, though not severe enough for the full penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences carry rhythm and varied structure, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the first half. However, the final third introduces paraphrase loops—"felt something...felt whole," "wanted to be remembered...wanted to be the ghost"—and summary phrasing ("let the understanding settle," "trusted that it would continue") that flatten propulsion. Template cadence appears in reflective beats without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled, information density high, and figurative language purposeful ("canyon stretched before her like a throat"). However, template cadence appears: "The diamond grew warm... and she felt the weight"; "she opened her mouth... and she felt the curse lifting." Paraphrase loops in paragraph four repeat the idea of translation and accumulated sound across adjacent lines. These artifacts dull momentum in mid-beats but do not obscure the closure image, limiting deduction to this category.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.7)
    Runs of identical syntactic stems appear across adjacent paragraphs ("It was here," "It was said," "This was not," "This was the harmony"). The phrase "missing and had returned changed" recurs three times without added pressure. Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats ("membrane between worlds," "frequencies of sound and silence," "pure metamorphosis") but several metaphors remain abstract rather than concrete. Information density is moderate; the herbalist's belief and the arrowhead's origin are mentioned but not integrated into action. Overwriting in the final third (stacked modifiers, passive constructions) slows momentum. No severe clarity breaks, but scaffold phrasing and paraphrase loops lower propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is evocative, but several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the gap between knowing and understanding" recurs four times with minimal variation), template stems ("Elara [verb]" appears six times in close succession), and elevated diction that drifts from embodied perception into abstract register ("询问" appears untranslated, likely a generation artifact). Stock metaphors ("winter branches," "sap in spring") appear in high-density clusters without payoff. These issues dull momentum in the middle third and touch the closure paragraph ("the earth's long memory").

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("cobalt arcade," "canvas bag weighed heavier," "copper light of dusk"), but several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and thematic over-explication. The opening's "what maps showed as one thing and what people knew as another" is immediately followed by "borders existed more in the eyes of those who enforced them than in the dirt beneath a man's feet"—two sentences restating the same idea. The passage explaining the thunderstorm vessel contains nested exposition that stalls momentum: "The storm had been a gift from a scientist fleeing the western laboratories, someone who understood that broken promises left wounds invisible but unhealed." Figurative language occasionally muddles rather than clarifies: "foster fragile connections by linking absences" reads more like a writing-prompt echo than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across beats; long, clause-stacked sentences in the opening establish meditative pace, shorter beats arrive at discovery. Information density is high in descriptive passages but drops in the final paragraph, which loops "silence" and "fragment" without advancing pressure ("let the silence speak, knowing that in its quiet spaces" recycles the core idea). Template cadence appears in paired negations ("not just an object but a calling," "not emptiness but a space") across three beats, reducing propulsion. Figurative language (wind bells "singing," fragment "pulsing") is coherent but dense in every sentence of the discovery beat without clear payoff. One paraphrase loop: "the fragment pulsed in response" followed immediately by "its gleam intensifying as if the metal itself recognized" restates recognition without new detail. No clarity breaks at closure, capping total line debt at −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (walls shifting, threads straightening, geometry responding) supports the ritual's atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. Orientation is efficient, and information density is high in the opening paragraphs. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematically—"reawakening," "analog memories," "stories lived," "purpose fulfilled"—restating the premise rather than advancing it, and the phrase "the particular satisfaction of purpose fulfilled" tells rather than shows closure. Template cadence appears in "She understood, suddenly, what she must do" and similar declarative stems across the ritual sequence, applying −0.4 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high, and figurative language ("wind carried voices," "colors that seemed to absorb light") serves atmosphere without muddling clarity. Sentence rhythm varies, though several paragraphs open with "She + verb" or "The + noun" patterns that create mild template cadence. Paragraph three contains a paraphrase loop: "The image stirred. A woman...turned her head" followed immediately by "Then the light strengthened and she stilled again"—the turn and still are restated without added pressure. The final paragraph's "finally captured, finally home" risks stock phrasing but lands as voice-consistent closure. No severe scaffolding or synonym churn, but the density of abstract nouns ("cipher," "residue," "quality of being") in peak beats slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. However, figurative language is dense throughout ("sleeping birds," "bruised plums," "enveloped secrets," "hush of cosmic possibility") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, approaching overwriting. Minor loops appear: "across the hush of cosmic possibility" recurs twice in adjacent paragraphs. The phrase "improbable longing" appears three times, creating synonym churn. Information density is high, but some lines ("those who passed her...deliberately forgettable") summarize rather than advance. No major clarity breaks, yet the cumulative texture dulls momentum slightly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clear and rhythmically varied, with strong opening imagery ("glass dome breaching the marsh like the back of some slumbering leviathan"). However, several passages loop conceptually: "chronically curious" appears three times with similar framing, and the skeptic-to-believer arc is restated multiple times across the piece without added pressure. "Crisp nostalgia" and "strange paths" in the final lines feel like stock metaphor rather than earned particulars. The weeping moment ("releasing salt that mingled with the marsh") works, but adjacent lines summarize rather than deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory anchors are vivid. However, multiple figurative constructions cluster without pattern-teaching: "stood...as an empty playground swing drifts," "dark leaf of stillness pressed against the pane like a标本," "the suspended instant when the swing hung at the apex." The Chinese character "标本" (specimen) and "暂停" (pause) break lexical coherence and read as untranslated tokens. Minor paraphrase loop: "exile is reversible" restated across shadow explanation and closing speech. Information density is moderate; many sentences do two jobs but some ("She had placed it there deliberately, teaching herself...") scaffold theme rather than advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("mist rose like whispered prayers," "weave new threads of magic"). Minor overwriting: "liquid silver," "liminal space," and "essence of places that were slipping away" cluster elevated abstractions in adjacent beats without pattern payoff. Paraphrase loop: "The seed had been saved...to weave new threads" and "not merely to grow a tree, but to weave new threads" restate within two lines. Propulsion slows in the third paragraph with nested exposition. No fatal loops or artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled with strong imagery ("shimmer at the net's center, like heat rising from summer stones"). However, several passages loop conceptually: the opening's "light was never truly broken—only bent" is reprised nearly verbatim in structure and sense at the end, and "interlaced hush" / "accumulated silence" recur without evolving function across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "She understood... The spirit had been... She drove the needle..." Sequential sentence openings with identical stems reduce propulsion. Minor proofreading: "exhume the spirit" is an odd verb choice (exhume = dig up a body; perhaps "release" or "unbind" was intended?). These artifacts do not obscure causality but do dull momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from template cadence and phrase repetition: "methodically curious" appears three times, "whispered chapel" four times, "shielded openness" twice, often as labels rather than dramatized choices. Paraphrase loops cluster in the final paragraph ("secrets no longer silent, its stones holding the memory") restating closure claims without advancing pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("understood," "believed," "considered") dull immediacy in reflective passages. Information density is low in the opening and closing paragraphs, which summarize character traits and thematic achievements rather than advancing scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the opening establishes voice and stakes efficiently. However, the piece carries scattered template artifacts: "After the Earhart discovery, after the world celebrated" uses parallel structure without tension, and "she understood, finally" is a common epiphany opener. The phrase "the sophisticated melancholy of the message" reads slightly elevated for mid-crisis diction. One paraphrase loop: "She would find the daughter. She would deliver the transmission" restates the same commitment without added pressure. These minor slips, none touching closure directly, accumulate to −0.7 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines doing double duty (e.g., bolt plate description conveys both object and atmosphere). However, the opening 85-word sentence, while syntactically controlled, front-loads exposition and slows entry. Metaphoric density is uneven: "liminal place where earth dissolved into ether" and "frequencies that no living voice could match" work, but "tinkersong wonder spilling from every stone" feels vague and asserted rather than embodied. Minor scaffold: "the ghost in code had been calling" / "the ghost had been a balladeer too, once" / "the ghost's song" repeats the anchor without variation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and clarity remains high. The closure beat's figurative language ("harmony that neither of them could achieve alone") is generic rather than sharp, pulling the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clarity and momentum are mostly strong, with sentences doing double duty (e.g., "She held the captain's goggles in her hands—Jansen had forgotten them in the mess hall again" anchors object, character, and motive). However, line-level issues accumulate: (1) Paraphrase loop in the opening two sentences (both note the elevator's groaning; the second adds "ancient cables" but restates the climb). (2) The penultimate sentence runs 68 words with stacked subordinate clauses that slightly obscure the core action. (3) Mixed metaphor: "stepped into the light...into the quiet space where a man had trusted his sorrow to leather and brass"—the spatial metaphor (stepping into light/space) clashes with the trust metaphor (confiding to materials). These artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly but spread across mid-story and penultimate lines, warranting a −0.8 cumulative deduction per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear but suffers from scaffold and template cadence: "There—a towering cumulonimbus...There—a wispy cirrus...There—a gentler altostratus" repeats stems mechanically without pattern-teaching payoff. Filter-verb clusters ("noticed," "realized," "felt," "thought") dull immediacy in high-density beats. The phrase "quiet explosions of understanding accumulating like cloud layers" is figuratively muddy (explosions don't accumulate like layers). Paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph restates "string broke...strings could be rewoven" without added pressure. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and filter stacks, −0.3 for figurative incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax, and information density is high in description of the coin and Mira's painting process. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "The library inside...had been hollowed...its walls still smelling" and "The guild's last living member had died...leaving behind...His note mentioned...and a request." The phrase "heightened stillness" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly forced. Figurative language ("memories reverberating through time," "living presence") clusters without clear pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase loop: "patterns too intricate to perceive" / "patterns...she was merely revealing what had been hidden."

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Sentences do multiple jobs ("The phrasebook's edges were soft...its margins filled with Mira's own handwritten notes") without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor issue: "diligently curious nature" is a tell-y label, and "the call to chart the next great discovery thrumming through her veins like electricity" edges toward stock metaphor. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels, slightly dulling momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but suffers from density overload: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction, flattening rhythm and slowing momentum ("dust motes hung suspended like frozen thoughts," "volumes binding knowledge that had survived the slow erosion of centuries," "frames twisted into shapes that suggested both organic growth and mechanical precision"). The phrase "driftwood" appears three times across the piece without functional variation, reading as synonym churn. Paragraph structure varies, and grammar is clean, but the cumulative figurative weight dulls propulsion in a story that spans multiple beats. The closure beat itself ("parted like curtains of frozen light") remains legible, preventing deeper penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that support momentum. Information density is high in the opening (orchard planet, floating arches, crash landings compressed efficiently) and thins during the restoration montage. Minor scaffold appears: "patient and persistent," "kind eyes and perpetually chapped lips," "curious and close" patterns echo across beats. The final image ("wings unfurl in the garden they had built together") is clean and propulsive, but the preceding paragraph stacks abstraction ("collective faith," "blessing," "nebula of respite") without concrete anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is dense with figurative language—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—creating a pattern of overwriting that flattens urgency. Lines like "where the air itself seemed to hold its breath" and "tiny witnesses to this final act of preservation" stack poetic constructions without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph two restates the clock's beauty in overlapping images without advancing knowledge. Sentence openings vary, but information density is low; many lines perform texture work without tightening stakes. No critical causality break occurs, but momentum drags under ornamental weight.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—long, winding opener establishes mood, then tightens during descent and nut placement. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character knowledge, or pressure. The "offhandedly exact" phrase recurs three times (nut, memory, initial description) within ~900 words, edging toward decorative in the second mention but justified by thematic weight. Minor template cadence in paragraph four: "She moved… her boots… The birds noticed… they did not approach. The curse had made…" runs four consecutive subject-verb stems, slightly flattening propulsion. No major loops or muddy metaphors; the "orchard clung… like a wound" opener is vivid and specific. Clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, alternating longer reflective passages with shorter declarative beats ("She was here to atone, though she did not know how"). Clarity is high, and information density is strong—most lines do double work (e.g., chrysalis description simultaneously anchors backstory and primes closure). Two frictions lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("extraordinary—spirals within spirals" followed immediately by "traced a particular swirl…following its curve as it formed and unformed") and template cadence runs in the middle section (three consecutive "The [noun]" openers). The final paragraph risks overwriting ("each structure a kind of emergence, each synthesis a kind of transformation") with stacked parallelism that inflates rather than tightens, though it stops short of full purple.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or thematic layering. Sentence openings vary, and figurative language (prismatic shadows, glimmering parole) serves the concept without overwhelming. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Each empty bottle… represented a story someone had chosen not to tell" is restated as "These were not complete works but the raw materials of creation." The phrase "waiting to be born" / "waiting for someone to give them shape" recurs with minimal variance. Template cadence in the opening paragraphs ("She had traveled… She set down… She moved…") slightly dulls momentum. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong figurative density in the opening ("palimpsest of remembered moments," "emotional residue seeping into every molecule like salt into sea-weathered wood"). Sentence structure varies, and the three-day work sequence is efficiently compressed. Minor template cadence in the pavilion description ("Each formation a memory made solid, each hollow pool holding...") and slight paraphrase loop between "stored remorse" mentions in paragraph two, but these don't obscure causality or closure. Information density is high; no major scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several passages exhibit template cadence and overwriting: "rehabilitated shy students...rehabilitated the library's neglected...had rehabilitated the concept" is a synonym loop that dulls momentum. Figurative density in the opening ("gravitational pull," "winter snow against grain elevators") creates muddle without advancing scene pressure. The final beat summarizes rather than propelling through image, and the closure paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("starlight and song," "harmonious choral librarian") that obscure rather than sharpen. Apply −0.8 for loops and figurative overload across high-pressure beats, plus the closure beat is touched by abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong specific images ("fine red sand," "brass housing tarnished," "fragmented glass in patterns"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "multi-layered quality...not merely a reflecting surface but something more complex, more intentional" recycles the same concept; "fundamentally different" echoed by "transformation was complete" within two sentences. The transformation beat summarizes ("worked through the night...modifications were not merely mechanical but conceptual") rather than dramatizing the actual work. Template cadence surfaces in repeated "the mirror" sentence openers in paragraph two. Filter-verb density is moderate but not stacked. Minor −0.6 for loops and summary at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and the read-aloud test passes, but figurative density is high in every paragraph without respite: "prism-minded," "breath held too long," "gossamer," "born into air," "seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze," "clandestinely luminous," "sprolved." The metaphors are coherent individually but stack without pattern-teaching, dulling immediacy. Line-level clarity is strong; no loops or scaffold. The neologism "sprolved" at closure jars rather than charges. Grammar and syntax are clean, but information density is uneven—some lines do multiple jobs; others reiterate theme.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and sustained without clear pattern-teaching: "silence arrives after a held breath," "roots that spread like bass lines," "symphonic progressions," "nodes," "natural amphitheater," "tiny speaker." In the climactic beat, metaphor stacks continue ("whisper of a tone," "everywhere and nowhere," "emotion transferred through vibration"), reducing clarity when precision would heighten impact. Template cadence appears in mid-story: "She lifted it carefully... The cracks fascinated her... The cracks suggested nodes..." Paraphrase loops emerge: the insulator's history is narrated twice (manufacturing pressure, wire weight, thermal expansion). Filter-verb reliance is moderate but present. Information density is good in discovery beats, but scaffold sentences ("There was a kinship there") and conceptual redundancy lower propulsion. Apply −0.8 for figurative muddle in peak beats and −0.4 for loops.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, with vivid concrete detail ("copper light," "polished basalt"). However, the final paragraph exhibits paraphrase loops and template cadence: "to teach without speaking, to understand without being understood, to find beauty in the difficult" cycles through near-synonyms without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("he had been," "he had learned," "he had not been sent away"), dulling immediacy. These artifacts trigger −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and grammar are clean. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm supports the accumulative design. However, several lines loop conceptually: "silence she inhabited now" is elaborated twice in adjacent sentences; "listen/listening/listened" recurs without progression; "exactness" and "specific pitch" are near-synonyms in close proximity. Figurative density is high ("moth's wings," "spent thoughts returning home," "morning light, uncertain but willing") without pattern-teaching, trending ornamental in the reflective beats. The final image (sparks falling) is vivid but does not sharply propel; it ornaments rather than reweights. Information density is moderate; the catalog of silence types (432 hertz, lover's static) adds texture but does not alter present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but overwriting appears in clusters: "the particular hush that wildflowers keep before their first bloom" and "undercurrent of wisdom so profound" layer metaphor without added clarity. The phrase "olfactorily sensitive" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. The doodle-wrapping custom is introduced with exposition that stalls momentum ("her mother had explained that these spontaneous drawings were a family custom…"). Paraphrase loops: "her ambition reorganize itself into something truer" echoes earlier "ambition had always pushed her forward" without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the gift-unwrapping passage. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull several mid-story beats. No loops touch the closure harvest moment directly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifact patterns lower the score. Paraphrase loops appear: "watched the viewport...and the world outside shifted" closely echoes "watched the tree's branches extend...watched flowers burst." Template cadence runs through multiple "she had" and "the [noun] began" constructions. "Whirling silence that filled the spaces between phenomena" is figuratively muddy (silence doesn't fill; phenomena is abstract). The closure beat remains clear, capping deductions at mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (credentials/patch/rescue corps/inquiry compressed efficiently). However, several lines carry decorative weight without advancing pressure: "held breath," "soft insistence," "texture to it" function as atmospheric padding. The opening's flight-engineer patch receives an entire subordinate clause of backstory that stalls momentum. "Hazy precision" in paragraph four exemplifies the thematic reach but also the tendency toward abstract metaphor. No loops or scaffolding, but figurative language occasionally dilutes clarity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines frame well. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The ice had waited millennia… The music had been waiting just as long" and "She understood that the sculpted hush… was not merely absence… but presence of waiting" restate the same idea across adjacent sentences. Template cadence runs with "Yara perceived," "Yara felt," "Yara understood" cluster in the middle third. Mixed metaphor: "aurora… drink in" (aurora is light, cannot drink) and "wonder poured through her like light through glass" (light does not pour). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering baseline Q7 deductions and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb stack rule.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (the flute as both relic and symbol; the canyon as both setting and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final sentence modulates well. However, three artifacts lower the score: "avalanchingly quiet" is strained metaphor mixing register; "dust motes that floated in the still air like tiny suspended worlds waiting to be born" is purple and self-indulgent in a grief beat; and the long explanatory sentence beginning "This was where the Weaving had first manifested" loops through paraphrase without advancing pressure. The artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy in key moments. No template cadence or scaffold loops appear elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentence openings vary, but several passages loop conceptually: "mathematics of emotion" appears in multiple forms (arithmetic of the soul, emotional signatures, transposed empathy) without advancing new pressure. The line "The process disorient through deliberate ambiguity" omits a verb ("disorients"), reading as either purposeful compression or a grammatical slip; if intentional, the effect is not taught early enough to feel confident. Stock metaphors appear ("tear from something that could no longer hold its sorrow") and figurative density is high in the opening paragraph without pattern-teaching or strong payoff. Information density is present but scaffold sentences ("She had discovered what she set out to find") summarize rather than dramatize the closure beat, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmic with strong figurative work ("the aurora painted everything in ghostly greens," "roots of something waiting to break through soil"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or theme. Template cadence surfaces in the final paragraph: three successive clauses using "was still" and "keep [verb]ing" create a drumbeat that flattens propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: "The pendant doesn't preserve encounters. It extends them" immediately restated as "brief encounters were never meant to end. They were meant to keep echoing." Stock metaphor: "seeds," "germinate," "roots" cluster without fresh specificity. No major clarity issues; the closure image is legible despite these slips.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: nearly every line advances Mira's practice, the arbor's history, or thematic resonance. However, several figurative phrases cluster without clear payoff: "cathedral made of crystallized whispers," "mist curled...like something trying to remember its own shape," and "shifted hush" appear in close succession, creating mild density drag. One paraphrase loop: "she had become one of the objects in this collection, her own essence slowly merging" restates the same content. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high. Minor overwriting in the opening third lowers momentum slightly but does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.3)
    Overwriting pervades: "raveling silence" appears five times, "impossible distance" thrice, and figurative language crowds most sentences without pattern-teaching ("time's unraveling tapestry," "stoically sparkling," "geometry and grief"). Paraphrase loops abound: paragraph three restates the grandmother-bead-message nexus already covered in paragraph two. Template cadence: "might have been memory, might have been intention, might have been the last word" stacks without advancing sense. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("latent sacrifice," "node in a pattern") inconsistent with a weaver's interior. Key closure beat is told, not shown. Artifacts touch closure; apply −1.7 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled, with varied sentence lengths and purposeful repetition ("perhaps… perhaps… perhaps") that supports the reflective tone. Information density is generally high, though some lines paraphrase without adding pressure: "the comfortable shadow of other men's confidence, never presuming to lead, never daring to imagine" cycles through near-synonyms. A few filter verbs ("watching children sift," "he understood") dull immediacy. No major loops or artifacts touch the closure beat, but the middle third includes explanatory scaffolding that could be trimmed. Grammar and mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and middle sections. The prose is mostly clean with strong verbs and specific nouns. However, three paraphrase loops appear: "The truth she had been chasing" / "the truth that her mentor had been trying to tell her" / "the withheld truth" / "the truth she sought" recur across adjacent paragraphs without adding pressure. The climactic paragraph stacks three "the truth/knowledge that..." constructions in close succession, creating template cadence at the story's peak beat. The phrase "the weight of a truth finally set down after years of carrying it without knowing" is abstract and contradicts the prior claim that she had been withholding it from herself. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence touching closure; the final image recovers momentum but the damage to the climax is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies; opening sentence grounds voice and stakes cleanly. Paraphrase loop: "The stones asked for help, and Maren understood immediately what they needed" followed by extended explanation of what she understood—mild redundancy. "Liminal spaces where land surrendered to water" and "fossilized prayers" are vivid but cluster with "breathing thing," "ghost of heat," "luminescent ache" in quick succession, creating figurative density that slows momentum in the lantern-room beat. Clarity remains intact; no grammar errors. "Pockets were heavier with meaning than they had ever been with cargo"—the final line's metaphorical neatness undercuts concrete charge.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "he had learned to feed the wick through total internal reflection" is immediately restated as "bending light back upon itself until the glass burned from within." Template cadence in the ship sequence ("The first ship emerged... The second vessel appeared, followed soon by the third") and figurative stacking ("monuments of shadow and hope," "green fire," "shadowed elation") in adjacent lines without pattern payoff trigger −0.6. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The people who magnetized stories were not special by birth but by accumulation" closely restates the final-paragraph insight. Template cadence emerges in the fourth paragraph ("She had absorbed… She had woven… until her very presence drew"). The closure paragraph stacks multiple declarative wisdom-statements that dilute propulsion. No major grammar or logic errors, but figurative density in reflective beats occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is vivid ("prayer," "cobwebs of memory," "stormlit tower"). Minor template stems recur: "She had learned… she had discovered…" and "The method is precise: she maps…" reads like scaffold. "At the moment a pin is heard" (the timeframe element) appears mid-story with no anchor or payoff, a clarity gap. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns—"sorrow made bearable by the act of counting it"—where concrete image would sharpen. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts, but the closure leans toward tell.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is densely figurative throughout, with metaphor appearing in nearly every sentence ("wounded heartbeat," "shattered mirror," "morning frost on stone," "water into parched earth"). This creates textural richness but flattens propulsion—multiple beats restate Elara's fragmented identity without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening: "She was the scattered memory keeper... and she moved..." The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "becoming less scattered even as she became less whole" immediately followed by "knitting together not herself but the realm's capacity for hope." Register remains elevated and uniform across the entire piece, never modulating with scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is high; no major loops or causality breaks. However, several lines carry mild scaffold artifacts: "She was a compassionate recluse, though she had never chosen the words together until now" reads as explanatory framing; "the cruelty of it" and "the paradox was nestled within her" lean toward stock intensifiers. Template cadence appears in the Philosophy of Errors paragraph ("This was where she came… when the answer had been…"). Information density is moderate—many sentences do double duty, but reflective passages occasionally restate rather than advance. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, limiting the deduction under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is generally high, and figurative language (vines claiming the tea house, butterfly uncloaking) is coherent. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "she would return tomorrow, as she had returned each day" echoes earlier phrasing; "the bread would continue its slow vanishing" mirrors "slow transformation," "slow decay," "slow restoration" in a repetitive pattern. The final paragraph front-loads summary ("her gift and her burden") that slightly dulls momentum. Applying paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties: −0.6 in Q7. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with vivid images ("embers refusing to surrender to wind," "clouds continued their slow pilgrimage"). However, several beats rely on paraphrase loops and summary: the second paragraph's "Each step was calculated, each breath measured" is immediately followed by restating the same caution. The phrase "gently meticulous" appears twice as a descriptor without evolving. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she observed," "she realized") cluster in the transformation beat, dulling immediacy. Minor scaffold issues prevent entry into the 7.5+ range but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear in the backstory: the paragraph beginning "She had come to this market to thwart someone" restates information already implicit in her presence and purpose. The phrase "the sound of trust breaking" recurs three times without evolving pressure or meaning between instances. Minor scaffold appears in "she thought about what it meant to capture the sound of trust breaking" immediately after the concept has been established. Figurative language is controlled but the "splinter" metaphor for the word "steadfast" strains slightly against the nautical/mechanical imagery elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Template cadence appears in the opening: "Mira's skin shimmered... but she questioned... especially now..." creates a list-like stem pattern. Paraphrase loop: "The tin tasted of copper and distance, a flavor that shifted" immediately followed by "A convergence was building—not just in the sky but in her perception, in the very fabric of the evening" restates convergence without added pressure. Stock metaphor ("memory made visible," "weather recognizes its own") in high-pressure beats. Figurative language appears in most sentences of the Seren encounter without pattern-teaching. Apply −0.6 for template cadence, −0.2 for paraphrase loop, −0.3 for stock metaphor density = −1.1 in Q7, yielding 6.1.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with vivid imagery ("cathedral columns and hanging gardens of quartz that pulse with an inner luminescence"), but overwriting surfaces in stacked metaphors and elevated register at several beats: "prismatic tears," "auroral sorrow," "womb of crystallized light," "memories given form." The line "After the last echo of laughter fades, I found the key" shifts tense awkwardly mid-sentence. Paraphrase loops appear in the reflection block ("She was the one with vision... she was the one with the courage to paint what lived behind appearances" restates the contrast already established). Template cadence in several "I remember" stems across paragraph four. These artifacts dull momentum but do not obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("After the oasis dried, the city had learned to live differently—growing upward, growing inward, growing truthful"). However, several artifactual patterns emerge: "She spread...She held...She followed...She found...She sat...She took...She wrote" creates template cadence in the second half. Minor paraphrase loop: "coordinates, and below them, the phrase" is immediately echoed by "the phrase 'where lost conversations go.'" Figurative language is occasionally strained ("dust that had forgotten how to be soil," "walls that no longer bloomed"). The closure image is clean, but accumulated line-level patterns across non-closure beats prevent entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is consistent with the lyric mode, though density of metaphor in every paragraph ("captive star," "thoughts that had forgotten their owners," "bell of the heart") risks overwriting without clear payoff. Minor paraphrase loops: "words had long since become unnecessary" / "words were for winter" / "words had become unnecessary" restates the premise three times. Sentence openings vary, and no egregious template cadence appears. The final paragraph's summary mode ("For now, she was satisfied") lowers propulsion and restates rather than advances. No line-level opacity, but information density could be higher; some sentences do one job when two are needed.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing sentences anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor loop: "fears were not destroyed by ignoring them but by being held gently" is elegant but paraphrased again in the ending ("small quiet space...where nothing needed to be remembered to be true"). Some figurative density in peak beats: "folded like origami," "static...resolve into something like clarity," "the glass was sky and the glass was sky" (intentional but heavy). No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clean and rhythmically varied with strong opening and atmospheric sentences. However, the piece accumulates visible loops and scaffold: "stories hidden within objects" / "objects carried the most valuable cargo," "healing required witness" / "listening was not passive but generative." The final third summary-tells multiple beats that warrant scene—the sister's reunion, the neighborhood's response, Elena's subsequent weeks. Template phrasing appears: "she understood finally," "she proved something to herself," "through her tears she thanked." These artifacts dull the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with stacked metaphors in nearly every sentence ("silence settled around her like a familiar shawl," "encrypted her vulnerability until it became armor"). Template cadence appears in the backstory sections: repeated "she had" constructions and parallel "her [noun], her [noun], her [noun]" lists. Paraphrase loops touch the dance sequence—"necessity, the only language left" restates "silence had taught her to speak in a language they could never decode" without added pressure. The foreign-language fragments obscure rather than clarify. Information density is uneven; the middle third recounts years of imprisonment in summary while the present action (descent, dance, drain) compresses into brief gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; sentences are grammatically clean and comprehensible. However, multiple beats loop conceptually: "memories spilled," "memories drifted," "memories… waiting" all restate the same idea without advancing pressure. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "photograph made of light and loss," "roads on a map of the soul," "silence became something almost physical." Template cadence appears in the backstory exposition: "She had been… she had never… Now she understood… The whale's death had…" stacks past-perfect constructions. Propulsion stalls in the middle third during coffee-ground and gravity exposition. The final image "let the light in" is abstract rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is consistently elevated with controlled rhythm and vivid figurative language ("smoke through latticework," "pale flame of folded possibility"). However, density issues appear: adjacent sentences in paragraph three paraphrase the same insight about prophecy as frequency/signal/noise without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in paragraph four with repeated participial openings. The phrase "vast倾听 of the world" mixes languages without clear purpose, creating a micro-opacity. The final paragraph edges toward summary ("the knowledge that even fate could be soothed") rather than trusting the dramatized image, applying the paraphrase-loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports pacing, but several sentences loop conceptually: "agreed-upon lies" is named twice in the penultimate paragraph, and "language of old buildings" recurs without added pressure. The phrase "present in the way that only the dead can be" in the final paragraph borders on overt thematic statement. Figurative density is high throughout ("stars streaking…like corrections," "membrane between what was real and what was merely true") without clear pattern-teaching, which risks overwriting. Clarity holds, but momentum sags in the reflective passages. No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative minor issues (paraphrase loops, elevated diction in peak beats) lower the score within the non-closure cap range.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is generally controlled ("fluorescent lights that buzzed against her thoughts like trapped insects"). However, several lines show minor scaffold: "The whispers grew clearer as the garden darkened, taking shape around her like a presence that had been waiting patiently" restates content from prior beats without adding pressure. The phrase "elegant delusion" and "ghostly resolve" feel slightly stock. Information density is strong in the shell mechanics but thins in the climactic acceptance moment.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but overwritten in several beats. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "stalactites dripped their patient measure of time, each drop a heartbeat in the cathedral's silent pulse" stacks metaphors in the opening. Mixed metaphor: the key is "calibrated not to locks, but to intention" yet later the wall "crumbled at her touch"—the mechanics shift from metaphorical to literal without clear transition. Paraphrase loop: "calibrated treason" is explained three times across paragraphs two and three. Template cadence in paragraph five: "Each brushstroke was... a forgiving of... a pardoning of..." The final two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize, with loops ("unlinked herself" appears twice in the closing).

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing lines carry lyric weight. Information density is high in the first two paragraphs, then backstory reiterates the echo-people mystery without advancing present stakes. Minor template cadence in paragraph three ("Why did some people echo? Not the physical kind...but the deeper sort") and a paraphrase loop between "echo people" explanations. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. The final sentence runs long with stacked clauses that slightly blur propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose carries a consistent lyric register but suffers from pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She had come to expose" / "She had pulled it from the wreck herself" / "She had come to give this child back her name" recur with identical syntactic stems across multiple paragraphs. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence in the opening paragraphs deploys metaphor ("flickering memories like delicate flames," "vessel for preservation," "borrowed starlight") without advancing pressure. Stock phrasing appears at peak beats: "crystalline clarity," "borrowed light," "patient silence." Information density is low; adjacent sentences restate content (e.g., paragraph four's two descriptions of the child's appearance in dreams). These artifacts touch multiple beats and dull propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmic and imagistic with high density: most sentences layer setting, character insight, and thematic material. Figurative language is dense ("moon paths…like silver stitching," fireflies as "scattered thoughts," net-mending grammar) but coherent and voice-motivated. However, runs of abstract philosophizing ("the invisible threads that connected moments," "how a single break could unravel meaning itself") accumulate without immediate scene pressure, risking decorative overwriting. Paraphrase loop: "invisible threads…patterns she could not see but understood" restates rather than advances (−0.2). Template cadence in middle paragraph: "Her neighbors thought…but they brought…trusting…just as she appreciated…" creates a drumbeat (−0.3). Closure beat stays clear.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; opening sentence anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high in the setup. Template-cadence slip: "Each theory arrived with its own convenient martyrs and villains, each designed to make people feel they understood" repeats "each" stem. Paraphrase loop: "The truth isn't a punishment. It's just the thing everyone agreed to forget" restates in adjacent beats without added pressure. The final paragraph's "the truth was never a destination—it was simply the stillpoint" recycles the metaphor without tightening it. Minor clarity gain from cutting scaffolding phrases ("she had learned," "Mira understood then").

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense, but high-pressure beats accumulate metaphors without clear propulsion: "veins, of rivers, of things that carried life through darkness" and "a flower made of static and lightning" blur rather than sharpen. Paraphrase loop in final paragraph: "the pieces were beginning to unfold" / "deep roots from which new light could grow" restates theme without advancing action. Some filter-verb stacks ("seemed to say, or maybe she dreamed it said") dull immediacy. Syntax is varied, no typos, but density tips toward purple in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is controlled ("glass jars that clinked like wind chimes," "the sea like paintings abandoned by an impatient artist"). However, several beats rely on abstract summary: "the human ache behind every sound he had ever hoarded" and "meaning that transcended mere vibration" tell rather than show. "Sweeten" appears twice in similar constructions ("sweetened those raw recordings" and "sweeten the world's silence"), a minor loop. The final paragraph's explanatory mode ("not fame or fortune, but connection") flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high in the technical beats (frequency tuner, harmonic spectrum, counter-oscillation). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The challenge was that she needed to adapt her approach in real-time, feeling her way through the harmonic spectrum" restates the vibrational-matching premise without new pressure. The final paragraph summary ("Through the windows, the last sliver of golden sunset slipped below the horizon, but the harbor was safe. She had adapted, as she always would, through the marriage of logic and feeling, and the sacred artifact would continue its eternal song") repeats closure points across three sentences without propulsion. Template cadence shows in the progression "She climbed... entered... withdrew... pressed... closed... adjusted," a stem-stack that flattens momentum. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt the weight," "felt both beautiful") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 2's "viaduct hummed" / "frequency she felt" restates the same sensory input, and paragraph 4's "unyoking begin" / "unyoke the ancient energies" cycles synonym churn (−0.4). Template cadence in paragraph 3: "Each night she unyoke herself… sitting… reading…" stacks three participial actions in formulaic sequence (−0.4). Figurative language ("ribs of some ancient beast," "mirror of silver fire") crowds several beats without clear payoff, trending toward decorative overwriting (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level execution is mostly clean with strong sensory anchoring and purposeful detail selection. Some template cadence appears in expository beats ("Her job was to determine," "Her mentor, Director Chen, would have expected," "Elena had joined this division to") that front-load backstory mechanically. The phrase "entangled memories not her own" repeats the core concept without embodying its mechanism, and "resonated with the memories embedded in these walls" stacks abstractions. Information density is generally high, and the closing parallelism (lantern carried "not as escape, but as illumination") lands cleanly without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or over-elaborate without adding pressure: "words spoken in that institutional setting carried weight beyond their immediate meaning, that every confession landed like a dropped coin into some vast and patient ledger" restates the same idea twice. "Vibrant hush" appears three times as a phrase-anchor, risking template cadence. Mixed metaphor: "aptly deliberate" is used as an adverb of habit but reads as post-hoc characterization rather than embodied syntax. The final paragraph stacks two metaphors (music "like light breaking through storm clouds" and "the vibrant hush of something made whole") that blur rather than sharpen the closure image. Proofreading slip: "建华监狱" (Chinese characters) appears untranslated, jarring against the Delancey Street setting.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; sentences routinely do multiple jobs (e.g., "sharp in the way questions are sharp" fuses object description with theme). Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. However, several abstract nominalizations ("steadily curious disposition," "particular form of devotion," "essential being") elevate register in ways that, while voice-consistent, slow propulsion slightly in peak beats. The final paragraph's stacked "what" clauses ("what I had done, what the algorithm had made me do, what the yearning had demanded") read as summary rather than immediate action, applying mild brake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates selective sensory detail and generally clear sequencing. However, template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun]" openings and formulaic phrasing ("the cold case arrived," "the recurring numbers began appearing," "the sensed absence...sharpened"). Metaphoric language occasionally stacks without clear progression ("the silence that followed...versus...the kind that echoed louder than the songs"). Information density is moderate; some lines do double work (patch description reveals mission and motif), but scaffolding phrases like "Maren understood then" summarize insight rather than dramatizing it. No paraphrase loops or severe artifacts that obscure causality, but minor template effects accumulate across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but controlled: "veins through marble," "sleeping giants," "current carry her toward what she needed to see." However, the final third carries minor loops—"understood" recurs three times in close succession, "walking" twice in adjacent beats—and "the weighted breath before reply" is reused without reweighting. Information density is high, propulsion steady, though the closure sentence stacks clauses ("the fragment warm… the orchard bending… softening the ice") in a way that slightly diffuses impact.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in most beats. However, "fold in patience" recurs as abstract phrasing without concrete anchoring, and the penultimate paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "irony was not lost"/"irony was also a kind of gift" restates rather than advances. The final paragraph's "went to meet her own" feels slightly coy after the earned buildup. Figurative language is generally strong but "grinding against each other with sounds like distant bells, like conversations between worlds" stacks metaphors without full coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is specific ("skins tight with potential," "ghost marks"). However, loops appear: "watched it go...watched countless departures," "loved each other precisely because of their differences, not despite them" restates a cliché without fresh inflection, and the final paragraph contains mild synonym churn ("quiet arrival of acceptance...ancient patience"). The penultimate paragraph's thematic summary stalls momentum. Figurative density in the opening (amber, burnt honey, copper rust) is high but coherent; the closure beat remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm is deliberate and syntactically varied; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. However, figurative density is high throughout ("boundaries were forgetting themselves," "clearings she had conjured and consecrated," "echo would still be there to answer") without always serving pressure, creating ornamental texture in a story with minimal escalation. Some phrases verge on the abstract ("frequencies...new layers of meaning") where concrete action would increase propulsion. The prose is clean but momentum lags due to repetitive thematic circling.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is often specific, but several prose artifacts cluster in key beats. The final third contains paraphrase loops: "collective healing was not a destination but a practice" is restated in "every pain carefully held became a thread in a larger tapestry" without added pressure. Template cadence appears in stacked "she" stems and filter-verb reliance ("she understood," "she felt," "she was willing"). The unexplained "梯形" appears twice, suggesting artifact or untranslated placeholder. Information density is moderate; many sentences layer atmosphere without advancing stake or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and high information density. Opening and closing images are purposeful. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "library...held its breath like a congregation mourning a saint," "chandelier...flickering with an irregular heartbeat." Two issues lower the score: (1) Mixed metaphor in "the chandelier...had been dimming for months, its electrical candles flickering"—electrical candles is internally contradictory. (2) The intrusive Chinese character "螺纹" (helical thread/screw thread) mid-paragraph breaks immersion and reads as a paste artifact rather than purposeful polyglot code. Filter verbs ("had noticed," "had sensed," "had spent") stack in the second paragraph but fit the retrospective scholarly voice. No paraphrase loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("magnetic ribbons unspooling...like prayers no one remembered how to read"), but several beats stack metaphors without clear propulsion: the opening sentence alone contains fog sculpture garden, memory/forgetting space, videotapes as towers, and ribbons as prayers. Mid-story, "tidal longing rising and falling in her chest like something born from the ocean of time itself" mixes aquatic and temporal vehicles without tightening sense. Paraphrase loops appear: the penultimate paragraph's "tidal longing that had driven her here for so long settled into something quieter, something that felt almost like peace" restates the prior sentence's alignment claim. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]" across the final third, flattening rhythm. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum and touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; sentences layer image, metaphor, and interiority effectively. Rhythm varies—longer contemplative passages compress at the tremor, then expand again at closure. Two issues lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in the middle section ("To restructure is not to force stillness...But the problem was never the camera itself. The problem was my understanding") restates the same realization across adjacent beats; (2) stock metaphor in "the geometry of broken things" and "entropy that claims all things." No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The Chinese character artifact is a proofreading miss but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with strong images like the vinyl shard "catching the light" and Margery's "tea-colored eyes." However, several template cadences and scaffold phrases recur: "a small, sacred relic," "strange clarity," "architecture of grace," "pulsing stillness"—elevated abstractions that lean on stock metaphor strings rather than concrete, idiosyncratic detail. "The scent of hope hung in the room—not the aggressive hope that demanded 奇迹, but a softer kind" introduces a non-English character (奇迹 = miracle) that disrupts flow and reads as a generation artifact. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster without always serving voice. Paraphrase loops appear: "broken but still be useful, still sing" and "broken but still luminous, still singing" restate within close proximity. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and artifact spread, and −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (total −0.9 within Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is adequate but some lines paraphrase: "began to relearn everything she thought she knew" → "shadows were absences of light, but the Bend had taught her that nothing was so simple" restates without new pressure. The circle sequence uses template cadence: "continued moving... completed seven circles... last circle closed" without variation. One filter-verb stack (realized/understood/saw) in the climax. Stock metaphor "rose like breath" at closure. No major loops but moderate scaffold lowers propulsion. Clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. Figurative language ("cleft in certainty," "shrewdly innocent," "absurdly like constellations") occasionally stacks without full grounding—three abstract phrases in the opening paragraph risk opacity. Loop detected: "could not quite name" (para 4) and "could not articulate" (para 5) restate the same incapacity without progression. The final sentence runs long and risks diffusion; "persistent, shrewdly innocent belief" recycles the opening's phrasing. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat directly, limiting penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery ("mist pressing against the grotto entrance like a living thing seeking admission"), but several artifacts accumulate: the Chinese-character error, paraphrase loops ("reflectively vibrant" applied to both sea glass and pearl without functional distinction), and therapy-speak intrusions ("pearl of stillness at the center of her being"). The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns—"purpose," "communion," "radiance"—that summarize rather than dramatize the closure beat. Template cadence appears in the memory paragraph's parallel "she remembered...she remembered...she also recognized" structure without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, vivid sensory detail ("drip of thawing icicles"), and high information density. Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops ("simply stay. Simply witness. Simply proffer") and template cadence in the final paragraph ("Simply X. Simply Y. Simply Z"). Stock metaphor ("stone in her chest") appears once. No loops that obscure causality, but the repetition in the closure beat dulls propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but largely coherent. However, several constructions repeat structural patterns: "She had come… Now she came…"; "These were not failures but offerings…"; "She was not too old… She was not too scarred…" creating template cadence. The phrase "feral nexus" appears four times, "against the current" thrice, and "inside the whisper of closing pages" twice—functional motif but edges toward loop. Mixed metaphor in "swirling hush" (prompt tone) doesn't operationalize clearly. Information density is high, though some lines ("a hollow in her chest where the next book should be, where a whole world of made-up people…") paraphrase internally. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt," "seemed") is voice-appropriate but stacks in early paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, paragraph lengths create visual cadence, and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "forgotten songs weren't music in the conventional sense but something older" restates the prior lines about the nameless melody without added pressure. The phrase "golden stories" recurs four times across the piece, shifting from metaphor to literal phenomenon, but mid-story mentions ("tales of root and rain, of pollinators and patient growth") feel like thematic scaffolding rather than dramatized beats. Template cadence in the final paragraph—"The arbor would bloom again, the golden stories would continue their spinning, and the old practices would find their way back"—flattens the closure image into a list of outcomes rather than a single charged moment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports the accumulative design. Information density is high in the opening; most sentences layer action, atmosphere, and backstory. However, several lines lean toward overwriting: "invisible forces that moved through all living things," "moving stillness as her hands danced," and the cluster of metaphors in the final paragraph ("cold blue flame," "safekept starlight," "quiet translation from breath to starlight") approach figurative density without full pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase: "the cold pressed in like a living thing, yet Elara felt warm enough within her purpose" restates her comfort without advancing pressure. No loops or scaffold artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping deductions modest.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is lyrical and image-dense but leans toward overwriting in peak beats: "harvest of echoes," "vessel for wonder," "wounded season," "cellar of reason" stack figurative language without clear physical anchors. Paraphrase loops appear: "not simply stopped—it was waiting" echoes "pause deliberate, a sentence without a period." Template cadence in the final paragraph: "in the lull, in the echoes, in the space" is patterned but not taught early. Clarity holds; momentum dips under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence length and vivid imagery. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, setting, or the weaver's transformation. Minor loop: "a pressure behind the eyes, a stone in the stomach, a tightness in the chest" cycles through body-part phrases without variation in syntax, and "the weight of her own unnamed sorrow" / "weights of human weight" / "different weights of sorrow" recycles "weight(s)" across three adjacent paragraphs without functional distinction. These create momentary drag (−0.4 for paraphrase and template tendencies) but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; figurative density (fractal, shingled, whalebone) is high but pattern-taught and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    Early paragraphs show strong information density and varied rhythm. The final paragraph, however, exhibits paraphrase loops: "the work was love, and the work was letting go, and the work was keeping hold" restates the same content without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the "and there was no difference, and there was all the difference, and the rain kept falling, and the light kept fading" run. Figurative language is dense ("whispers," "crystallized time," "rust-hued peace") but mostly coherent; "the cage and the embrace were not opposites but companions" is abstraction rather than image. These artifacts cluster in the closure beat, triggering the stated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("ribbons of melody," "erosion of days," "salvage from wreckage"). Template-cadence penalty: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]" structures, creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loop at "exhaustion…is a kind of peace"—the prior clause already implies acceptance. Information density is strong in places ("collected fragments…with methodical desperation") but the final paragraph's triple iteration of "exhaustion" and "negotiation" dilutes propulsion. No critical artifacts touch closure directly, but cumulative minor issues prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and syntax is generally clean, but several passages loop or inflate without adding pressure: "hope, she realized, could not be measured in linear time" restates the prior paragraph's optimism; "stubborn persistence toward renewal" in the final line stacks abstract nominalizations where a concrete image would sharpen closure. The phrase "functionally creative, always had been" is summary-label backstory that could anchor in a present micro-choice. Template openings recur ("She descended," "She was," "She traced," "By noon, she had"). Figurative language—"hollow ribcage," "ghost of music," "dark ribbons"—is vivid in early beats but the closure paragraph abandons image for philosophical summary, dulling propulsion at the key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere, and the opening/closing images (clock's final breath / clock that did not stop) frame the arc cleanly. However, runs of filter verbs ("I watched," "I looked down," "I knew") and several paraphrase loops ("not quite a tick, not quite a tock, but something in between, something that sounded like…") dull immediacy in key beats. The prose occasionally stacks modifiers ("this simple timepiece meant to capture not hours but something harder to measure, the way light moves through water, the way dreams dissolve") without clear propulsion. Template-cadence artifacts and synonym churn (hush, silence, stillness recycled without new pressure) trigger cumulative penalty. No grammatical errors or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clear and rhythmically controlled, with strong specific images ("black glass," "gnomon cast a precise line"). However, several artifacts accumulate: "training instincts" appears twice in identical phrasing (template cadence); "architecture of lies" and "serene upheaval" feel like prompt labels rather than earned metaphors; "thoughtfully clear satisfaction" is abstract where embodied emotion would sharpen the beat. Paraphrase loops appear: "patience reconstruction of what had been deliberately obscured" restates the prior sentence's content without added pressure. These issues cluster but do not obscure causality, so penalties remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery (fulgurite's hollow channels, hemp worn smooth by salt). However, template cadence and ornamental metaphor accumulate: "breath creating small ghosts," "the oceanic hush settle into his bones," "patterns seemed to rearrange themselves… like a flower finally opening." The final sentence runs long with stacked dependent clauses ("already planning which ancient seeds… which patterns… patient as the tide, certain as the return") that loop thematically without advancing new information. Paraphrase loops ("preserve… preserved… preservation") and synonym churn ("patience… patient") appear across adjacent lines. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and figurative density in a non-peak but thematically central beat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Clarity is generally strong. However, multiple figurative clusters appear without pattern-teaching: "leaves fell like whispered confessions," "dry as old bone," "bark peeled like pages," "sorrow moved through a person like water through a delta," "light dying beautifully," "holding its breath," "lonesome splendor like a breath about to be released." The final third layers metaphor densely ("holding its leaves and its silence and its lonesome splendor like a breath") without a prior pattern that teaches the reader to expect this cadence. Template stems recur: "She wrote about X… She wrote about Y… She wrote about Z" in one paragraph. Paraphrase loop: "explained absences" is repeated across beats without evolving function. Deductions: figurative density −0.5, template cadence −0.4, paraphrase loop −0.2 = baseline ~7.0, capped at 6.9 due to closure-beat metaphor stack.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and selective sensory detail. Information density is high in the opening and chamber descriptions. However, several issues accumulate: "that particular" appears three times as a template stem; "bittersweet ache of partial understanding" and "sorrow and hope are finally reconciled" edge toward abstract summary rather than concrete image; the phrase "quaking reverie" is forced into the final paragraph to match the tone requirement. Figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff: "mechanical flowers frozen mid-bloom" is vivid but "bitter fruit" in the second paragraph feels generic. The final paragraph compresses the climactic realization into summary rather than propulsive scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or poetic apposition—without pattern-teaching or a payoff that justifies the sustained elevation. The final paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("unyielding compassion rising," "made of loss and fire and the stubborn grace") and synonym loops ("not unscathed but unbowed, not healed but healing") that dull propulsion at the closure beat. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph (three clauses beginning "for the..."). Applying density penalty (−0.5), loop penalty (−0.4), and closure-beat artifact (−0.7 escalation per the pack rules), then capping all categories at 8.8 per the artifact-in-final-third rule.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but several passages repeat conceptually: "skepticism like a lantern" and "dimly aware" overlap thematically; "someone had imprisoned fragments" is immediately restated as "memories that had been forcibly separated." Figurative density is high—"phosphorescence," "prismatic shadows," "temporal residue," "sidereal patience"—without always advancing action. The final paragraph's "luminous and doubtful and patient as the stars themselves" stacks modifiers without fresh specificity. No major loops or template cadence, but information density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high (each line advances atmosphere, character perception, or thematic weight). However, several passages loop conceptually: "the calculating machine gear" is named in full five times across eight paragraphs, and "the gear" appears in nearly every beat without functional variation. The phrase "approximates infinity's vast looping" and "infinite regression of calculation" restate the same abstraction within three paragraphs. "Troubling serenity" appears twice in adjacent sections. The prose is often luminous ("cold flame of pure intention," "small machine heart beating against flesh") but occasional filter-verb stacks ("Vael understood," "Vael stopped moving," "Vael reached out") and the untranslated "唤醒" artifact lower momentum. No major clarity breaks, but the cumulative scaffold and synonym churn ("calculating machine gear" vs. "small machine heart" vs. "gear") prevent entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and many lines carry double duty—sensory detail advances emotional state. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the words mattered less than the hands that shaped them, and the generations of hands before hers that had learned to hold grief like stone" restates the prior clause. Template cadence is visible in repeated "she + verb" stems in the middle third. Figurative language is dense—"humming warmth," "concentrated green breath," "thundering calm"—and occasionally muddles: "thundering calm" itself is a strained oxymoron without clear embodiment. The closure beat is less affected, but the accumulation of artifacts and loops throughout prevents high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the rake-handle passage, doing character/backstory/motif work simultaneously. However, multiple filter-verb stacks ("he had been," "he had accepted," "he had learned") dull immediacy in mid-story reflection, and the phrase "the timeframe he had planned for, the pause in the pendulum's swing when emergence became possible" loops the same concept across a dash. Template phrasing appears: "through tiny inscriptions...through the ritual...through the act" in one paragraph. Figurative language is dense but controlled; "sea of frozen flames" and "sky bruised purple and gold" are vivid without muddling. Apply −0.6 for filter stacks and template cadence in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no sustained template cadence. Clarity is high, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Minor scaffold: "He had discovered the shape of intentions: not grand or political, but human and humble" restates the prior beat's content without adding pressure. "Tenderly organized in his understanding" is abstract and stock; "uncharted echoes of a long-dead ruler's compassion" leans purple in the final beat. No loops or filter-verb stacks. Information density is moderate; the closure paragraph summarizes rather than advancing through image.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    Syntax varies purposefully, and figurative language (kingfisher, ice shards as timelines) is coherent and specific. However, several beats loop conceptually: the constraint/innovation tension is restated across paragraphs without adding new pressure. The phrase "she had come to do" and "what she had come to understand" echo template cadence. Paragraph four's long sentence listing policy ripples, discovery chains, and hope across generations reads as abstract summary rather than concrete imagery. The final beat lands cleanly. Information density is moderate; some scaffold could be cut. No major clarity breaks, but mid-band artifacts and paraphrase loops prevent higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with vivid sensory detail and varied sentence structure. Information density is good; most lines advance atmosphere or character. However, several passages loop or paraphrase without adding pressure: "She was a pirate broadcaster, though not of the old-fashioned sort..." restates what follows, and the final paragraph ("In the ruined city, in the years after the story famine...") recaps rather than propels. Minor scaffold and summary mode in expository passages lower momentum. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but pervasive minor issues prevent entry into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong imagery ("delicate scattering of evidence into air," "veins of honest grief"). Several instances of mild overwriting: "wishful thinking woven carefully into family mythology," "crystallized a fleeting emotion—through transformation, through the careful reduction" (paraphrase loop), and the final paragraph's compound clauses stack without sharp necessity. The phrase "mirage of safety radiating from fractured fragments" mixes metaphors (mirage/radiation/fragments). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; a few lines feel scaffolded ("where art came to vanish, where perspective bent toward infinity and nothing truly disappeared so much as transformed").

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high; sentences advance character and theme. However, the piece repeats the sedimentary-layer metaphor four times without evolving its meaning ("sedimentary layers," "sediment," "sedimentary layers of story," "sedimentary layers compress"), crossing into conceptual loop. The final paragraph contains mild scaffold: "but I work anyway, because…" and "Someone will find these artifacts someday, and when they do, they will know…" reads as summary rather than image. No major grammar issues, and the prose is clear, but the closure beat lacks propulsive concision.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high, and rhythm modulates well between reflection and present action. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the same gesture" recurs, "vanishing arts" is restated across paragraphs, and the template "She had..." opens multiple reflection beats. Filter verbs ("she could tell," "she recognized," "she knew") cluster in the middle third, dulling immediacy during key observation beats. The figurative language (rosette as patient eye, leaves settling) is coherent but leans decorative in high-density passages. Artifacts touch but do not obscure closure, so penalties remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and some lines carry density ("Each cut was a choice, each removal a gesture of faith"). However, several beats loop conceptually without adding pressure: the second and third paragraphs both establish Elena's gift and the university's claim. The climax relies on stacked abstract noun phrases ("not as visions, but as flavors, textures, the warmth of hands") that blur rather than sharpen. The final paragraph's concluding aphorism ("Some rebellions are fought with swords…") reads as tacked-on scaffold. No major syntax errors, but propulsion sags when abstraction replaces action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is mostly clean, but paraphrase loops appear ("the wonder had drained" / "children no longer looked up… with hopeful hearts"). Template cadence is present in repeated "she had been" constructions across the opening. Stock metaphors ("rising like bile," "settled like warm honey") reduce immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the same content without added pressure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm modulation. However, the piece suffers from template cadence in several passages: "Every chair angled... every drawer that hangs... every window latch" deploys mechanical parallelism without escalating pressure. The phrase "a shard of hush" appears twice in close proximity (paragraph 4) as both literal description and metaphor, creating synonym churn. Figurative density is high throughout ("streetlights daydream," "walls remember," "violet ghost") without clear pattern-teaching, occasionally obscuring rather than sharpening sense. The orris root functions as both object and atmosphere but its dual role sometimes blurs the causal line between physical shard and metaphorical effect.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid images ("foxglove-purple stains," "thread pulled from tapestry"). However, substantial line-level issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("not as a memorial to a lost city, but as a living system that thrived precisely because it embraced contradiction" followed immediately by similar restatements), elevated-register stacking in reflective beats ("incisively kind," "symbiont," "cognitive architecture"), and the intrusion of Chinese characters ("善意") mid-sentence as an apparent artifact. Template cadence appears in the fish-encounter sequence ("He asked the eels... He asked the oysters..."). Information density is uneven; the middle third summarizes insights rather than advancing through concrete beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are strong through most beats, but several phrases loop conceptually: "not hope of escape but something more fundamental: the need to understand" is echoed by "her motivation was no longer just escape" within a few paragraphs. Template cadence appears in "not a trap… but a structure," "not confinement but boundlessness," "not imprisonment but the infinite itself"—three parallel negations in the final paragraph that dull propulsion. Information density is high, and no major artifacts obscure causality, but the repetitive framing in the closure beat prevents entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is dense ("yellow haze, the streetlamps bleeding into the smog like dying stars," "saffron quiet," "moon-tipped brush") but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. One mixed metaphor: "the moon still touches those who cannot sleep with visions of connection" is slightly strained. Template cadence appears in two places: "The daydreams came… But tonight, they were sharp" and "She was roused… She would leave these paintings…" with parallel "She [verb]" openings across adjacent beats, triggering −0.4. No paraphrase loops. Clarity and concision are strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and high information density in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "displaced persons" recurs across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "rosewater dread" is defined, then repeated in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence in reflective beats ("She thought of… she thought of…") and stacked filter verbs in the final third ("she held… she watched… she picked up") reduce propulsion. Figurative language (emerald light, honey dripping from combs) is vivid but occasionally ornamental rather than integrated into action.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Several passages loop conceptually: "The solitude had sharpened her mind into something precise and patient, qualities that served her current purpose well" restates the opening's backward-clock premise without new pressure. Figurative language clusters densely ("cold fire," "shadows backward," "pure potential") in the climax without always clarifying the physics, and "latent radiance" appears four times across adjacent beats as a synonym placeholder rather than evolving detail. No major clarity breaks, but the cumulative pattern costs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and vivid figurative language ("peeling away in long, sorrowful strips that fluttered in the wind like desperate hands"). However, density suffers from repetitive thematic phrasing: "lingering luminance" appears five times, "opera cloak clasp" recurs with similar descriptors, and the confession beat includes near-paraphrase ("she had let herself sink… had welcomed the water's embrace"). The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("whatever life waited," "whatever morning came next") that dilute specificity. Filter verbs cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatical. However, paraphrase loops are pervasive: "not simply a splash but a bass note," "not because of any connection… but because the word meant to double," "not as impediments but as instruments." Template cadence runs appear ("She had been called… She didn't simply forecast… She had learned… She smiled"). Figurative density is high without escalation payoff ("endless symphony," "restless euphony," "great composition"). Applying −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.4 for figurative muddle across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, character motive, atmospheric charge). The opening's "spiral-shell cartographer moved through the amber light with the patience of someone who had learned…" establishes voice and stakes efficiently. Minor scaffold detected: "The patterns had changed since the rust. Where the shell spirals once pulsed…" could compress the transition. One instance of filter-verb density in mid-passage ("She had learned to crack the code…from her mentor, from the journals…") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. The whistle sequence tightens propulsion cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; figurative language ("sunwashed dread," "relentless sun…like something dying") is apt and integrated. Proofreading is clean; one typo ("测绘ing") appears mid-sentence but reads as generation artifact rather than prose flaw—no deduction under Text Artifact Screen guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs: "She had come here because... something about that... had crystallized her resolve" recaps itself; "not simply to expose a lie but to demonstrate how noble lies functioned" restates without advancing. Figurative density in high-pressure beats ("parallel lines of history," "mortar that held collective identity") muddies rather than propels. Sentence openings repeat ("The illuminated letter," "The question that," "She had come," "Using the method"). Information density is low; many lines summarize the same reflective stance. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, −0.4 for figurative muddle in peak beats, totaling −1.2 baseline with artifacts touching the closure beat, triggering −1.7 cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled: "The waterline crept higher each decade" and "kelp draped the railings like widow's veils" demonstrate concision and specificity. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph: three sentences begin with "The" or "She" in close succession, creating slight monotony. The metaphor "hushed blaze" is introduced late and borders on abstract, though the prior work (cold water, wet limestone, "bruised sky" ink) earns it. No loops or scaffolding; grammar and punctuation are clean. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but several constructions loop or restate: "reclaimed stillness" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "honest origins" and "forgotten truths" cycle near-synonymously; "the darkness stripped away" echoes "the blackout had stripped." Template cadence is mild ("she had been," "she had never," "she understood now"). Register occasionally drifts ("construct alternatif hypothesis" mid-thought). No major artifacts obscure closure, but cumulative line-level issues and paraphrase loops lower the score. Apply −0.8 for distinct loop and scaffold issues within the non-closure accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines are strong. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance). Clarity is generally excellent, though some figurative constructions border on overwriting: "grief… as something more insidious: a constant luminescence that hurt to look at directly" stacks metaphors densely in a single beat, and "fold sorrow into shapes that could hold light" risks abstraction. Template cadence appears briefly in the fold-sequence narration ("valley fold, mountain fold, squash fold…"), which reads as intentional technical specificity but flattens momentum slightly. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Grammar and tense are clean; pronoun references clear. The piece approaches 9+ density and propulsion but the occasional metaphor density in high-pressure beats (luminous torment, constant luminescence, strange grace) and one brief scaffold list keep it in the strong 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; information density is high. The geode beats are vivid and propulsive. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "unused potential pools" is restated three times across the piece; "things that were there and are not, things that were not there and are" is echoed in "futures that never activated, possibilities that aborted mid-sentence, lives that were calculations this universe chose not to complete." The final paragraph runs long with multiple appositives that restate the hunt without advancing it. Stock phrasing: "false comfort of purpose," "bleak exhilaration" as a label. These loops and template cadences dull momentum and trigger −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive, with vivid imagery and controlled rhythm. However, the piece contains minor scaffold and paraphrase loops: "sharp eyes" appears twice in similar constructions, and the final paragraph recycles the concept of "belonging" and "missing piece" in adjacent sentences without added pressure. The line "brilliant and dim at once, a glow that illuminated without overwhelming" contradicts itself without clear metaphoric payoff. Sentence openings vary, and information density is good, but the loops and the self-contradictory metaphor lower the score slightly. No generation artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high ("sea swallow the sun whole," "slow bruise spreading through tissue and time," "weight of unspoken words pressed against her ribs") but some images are mixed or generic. Minor paraphrase loops: "weight of unspoken words" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph 2: "Each piece...Each fragment..." Sentence openings vary, but several paragraphs open with "The" or "She," creating visual monotony. Proofreading is clean. Information density is moderate; some lines repeat the guilt theme without advancing knowledge or choice. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes, reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clean, but several passages loop thematically without new pressure: "mistakes could be recycled into wisdom, but only if you actually changed" is paraphrased by "you cannot keep cycling through the same motions hoping for different results." Stock phrases appear—"kind of exhausted recognition," "people long dead who had left their descendants to sort through the wreckage"—and the final paragraph's "the knowledge that wisdom had come from pain, and that was enough" summarizes rather than trusts the image. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, others scaffold. No major artifacts touch closure, limiting deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening complex sentences give way to shorter beats during the paddling sequence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or theme. Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph five: the litany of "regretfully" constructions (ended relationship, withdrew, shrunk world) cycles through similar phrasing without added pressure, applying a −0.2 deduction. No other template cadence or scaffold detected. The final image—laugh, course adjustment, continued paddling—propels cleanly without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, character, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images anchor voice and stakes. Three patterned artifacts lower the score: "delicate robust" appears twice as a forced oxymoron, reading as template insertion for the prompt attribute. The final paragraph stacks explanatory summary ("not a contradiction but a synthesis," "both states existing simultaneously") where scene pressure could land the insight. Minor synonym churn in the opening ("clean slate seeker," "dirty past surgically excised") paraphrases the same content. Figurative language is controlled elsewhere ("water like something between a night sky and a living thing"), and no loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold: "She was afraid, and she was ready" / "not because she lacked the gift, but because she feared its price" / "not with violence, but with a gentle...unraveling" recycle balanced antitheses without advancing pressure. Figurative language clusters heavily ("like water, like welcome, like the arms") in the climax without pattern-teaching, triggering overwriting deductions. Stock metaphors ("funeral flames," "holy fire") and abstract intensifiers ("cosmic intimacy," "absolutely essential") dilute specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines do double work, but the final third leans on assertion over image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose demonstrates strong figurative control and vivid imagery ("moonlight that turned the mist below into rivers of molten silver," "years folding into themselves like origami birds made of regret"). However, the piece suffers from significant overwriting and template cadence in peak beats: the final paragraph chains five abstract oppositions ("not a place but a presence, not a pool... but a mirror," "not by accumulation but by acceptance, not by grasping... but by releasing") that flatten momentum through parallel structure and philosophical summary rather than embodied action. Paraphrase loops appear: "she needed to find where lost time accumulated" (paragraph 5) echoes "to find where lost time accumulated" (title concept) without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stacking ("She had come," "she had found," "she understood") in the opening dulls immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively; the opening's long, complex constructions give way to shorter beats during the stitching. Information density is high in most lines. Two paraphrase loops appear: "shadow work had begun...she realized—work that was not about fighting" restates the concept, and "all those preserved faces, all those ancient tears, all that shadow" cycles through near-synonyms. "Happiness—real happiness, not the performance of it" is therapy-speak that intrudes at a peak moment. Figurative language is controlled except for the mixed vehicle in "flower blooming in time-lapse" (dimensions don't bloom). Clarity and propulsion are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("cold light spelling," "patient shadows," "vibrant hush"), triggering density and coherence penalties. Paraphrase loops recur ("transformation's texture" restated across three paragraphs). Template cadence is evident in the final paragraph's stacked declaratives ("she had come," "she had become," "the volcano would tell"). The closing beat is burdened by scaffold rather than achieving propulsion, and the unexplained "火山" character is a typographical artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences vary in structure and the prose maintains clarity, but several beats suffer from scaffold phrasing: "She was, as she had always been," "She moved with quiet purpose," "Her motivation crystallized with perfect clarity." The final paragraph stacks abstract intensifiers ("far more enduring," "idea whose time had finally come") without concrete anchoring. A minor paraphrase loop appears when the quill holder's "hollow base" is described twice in adjacent paragraphs with slightly different phrasing. Information density is generally strong, though the opening's exposition about the regime's history adds context without advancing immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural momentum. Information density is high (each paragraph advances understanding, setting, or internal pressure). Minor artifacts: "lingering promise" appears three times with slight synonym churn ("lingered," "lingering," "finally settle"); "sacred" recurs five times across the piece without pattern-teaching payoff, drifting toward thematic placeholder. The phrase "but something else had been waiting beneath it all along" in the penultimate paragraph abstracts when a concrete image would charge harder. No major loops or template cadence, but the figurative density in the final third (starlight, memory, wing, constellation) trends decorative without new causal work. Proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is often striking ("lantern flickering against the storm's advance," "sleepless oceans"). However, figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence during peak beats—"light paint her vision amber," "voice rarefy in the thin mountain air," "storm-kissed wonder"—creating mild overwriting without a taught pattern. Minor loops appear: "the vigil had not been about waiting... about waiting for herself" and "not endings but cartography, not failures but maps" use parallel negation redundantly. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes: "realized," "understood," "began to write" tell the turn. Information density is good but momentum occasionally stalls in reflection. No severe artifacts, but cumulative polish issues prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "turning questions into destinations" appears in paragraphs 2, 8, and 9 with minor variation; "the brook's quiet [murmur/conversation/flow]" recurs three times without added pressure. Synonym churn: "conflict" / "confrontation" / "struggle" cycle across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in paragraph 5: "The mechanical arm had been... those early months... Now it served... its response time... its strength..." Filter-verb stack in paragraph 4: "understood," "learned," "responded." The closure paragraph stacks generic abstractions: "ongoing conversation between water and stone, between questions and answers, between what we know and what we have yet to discover." Apply −1.2 for loops and cadence runs, −0.3 for filter stacks in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in beats (the coffee tin introduction, the moon-rise transition, the midnight cataloging). Several passages show strong concision: "Delphine arrived with the quiet efficiency of someone accustomed to institutional rhythms." However, the final paragraph stacks modifiers and abstract phrases ("luminous and incomplete, a thing of beauty forged from the anarchy of circumstance") in a way that blurs specificity and borders on overwriting. Minor paraphrase loop: "still working, still talking, still building" repeats structure for emphasis but edges toward template cadence. The piece avoids major scaffolding but sacrifices some clarity to lyricism in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and often elegant ("each decision branching into consequences he could never have anticipated"). However, several beats suffer from synonym churn and decorative layering: "as though she were still in the audience, as though the arbor itself were listening, as though somewhere in the flicker between worlds" stacks three parallel clauses without adding pressure. The phrase "impossible in every way that mattered" appears twice in close proximity, and figurative density in the arbor sequence (clouds as tide, flowers with unnamed colors, piano of cloud-density) risks overwriting without clear payoff. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere more than story or character.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lyric and controlled with varied syntax and vivid imagery. Information density is generally high. However, the climax relies on stacked filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she understood") and synonym churn ("luminous moment of crystalline doubt") that abstract the peak beat. Paraphrase loops appear: "The collective memory…every mind that remained open" restates the scattering motif without added pressure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing closure, dulling propulsion at the moment of highest stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and supports the slow, post-rain mood; no template cadence. Information density is generally high, with most lines doing double duty (e.g., compass both literal object and metaphor for seeking). However, two issues lower the score: mild paraphrase loop in the final paragraph ("begin, at last, to diffuse" / "came slowly, like dawn light spreading" / "still containing all the shades of sadness, but opening") restates the gradual-opening idea three times without adding new pressure; and the phrase "something that might have been the memory of footsteps" adds a vague gesture that does not advance the moment. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "diffuse" as both verb and thematic anchor works, though "cerulean regret" is slightly over-written. No grammar or punctuation errors; clarity is high.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifact: in the first paragraph, "become, in effect, a ghost" introduces a slight abstract label. A near-paraphrase loop occurs between "geography of healing" and "first stroke of the map," though it's thematically resonant. These do not obscure closure but prevent a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished with vivid figurative language and high information density. Minor overwriting in abstract phrases ("bittersweet ache of partial understanding") slightly dampens peak beats, but no loops or scaffold artifacts harm clarity or closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and purposeful, with high information density. Rhythm varies effectively. Minor artifact: slight template cadence in a few descriptive lists ("devices that measured regret, instruments that captured fading memories..."). This does not touch the closure beat, but slightly softens momentum in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; figurative language is pattern-taught and serves closure. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats ("lingering luminance" repetition) but no loops or scaffold that obscure causality; sentence-level propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled with strong rhythmic variation. Information density is high; most sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor deduction for a slight risk of figurative over-density in the final paragraph ("like a sleeping god finally waking, like the unfiltered awakening..."), which momentarily leans toward synonymic accumulation, though it remains legible and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    Polished, dense prose with varied syntax and no artifacts; figurative language is precise and purposeful, and sentence‑level propulsion matches the story’s rhythm.

    Prose is dense and evocative without loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, figurative language consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifact: a slightly cliché phrase ("suspended between heaven and earth") and a moment of ornate description ("bruised violet and tarnished silver") that does not harm closure. Deduction applied for this non-closure decorative flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle—even in peak beats like the dream sequence—and closure image is clear and uncluttered.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaning; most sentences do more than one job (setting, character, and theme often layered). Metaphors are coherent and tightly aligned with the central conceit (dust patterns vs light curves, supernovae vs greenhouse cycles), and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. A few lines move into expository explanation rather than trusting image, which slightly dulls momentum near the end. Overall, though, line-level craft is strong and closure is not obscured by ornament or clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is polished, with varied syntax and strong information density—most lines carry both image and character or thematic work. Metaphors (glass holding sunsets, frost as ledger) are apt, not mixed, and repetition is purposeful rather than looped scaffold. The prose occasionally approaches the lush side, but it stops short of purple and does not obscure action or causality. There are no noticeable grammatical or sequencing issues.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level writing is polished, with strong information density and generally clean syntax; most sentences do more than one job (worldbuilding, character, and theme intertwined). The figurative language is frequent but coherent and on-theme, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright purple patches. Some phrasing repeats conceptual ground (“unshaken marvels,” restating her mission and realization) and a few lines tell what’s already implied, which slightly blunts momentum and impact. Still, clarity is never in doubt and the final image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaningful images that do more than one job—establishing mood, character, and world in the same strokes. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, and the syntax supports momentum despite the reflective tone. A few metaphors approach the familiar “literary” register without subversion, but they don’t bog clarity or undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for world-building and emotional charge (“gardens became both lifeline and laboratory”). Metaphors are apt and mostly controlled (water carving stone, the bell’s whisper-into-declaration arc), and sentence rhythm varies enough to keep momentum in a largely reflective piece. There is some abstraction and mild redundancy in the thematic phrasing, where multiple sentences restate similar ideas about sanctions and hope, edging toward discursiveness. Tightening those lines and trimming a few stacked modifiers would sharpen the already strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong imagery, and good information density—most lines advance both atmosphere and concept. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and thematically apt (“fireflies rose like the thoughts of earth itself,” “veil between remembered and forgotten thinned to gossamer”). There is some risk of overwriting in stacked metaphors and lush modifiers, yet it doesn’t materially obscure sense or blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and typically do more than one job (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion in the same line). Figurative language is frequent but carefully chosen and coherent with the story’s conceptual frame; it rarely feels like decorative purple prose. There is little to no obvious scaffolding, synonym churn, or paraphrase loops; the prose maintains forward momentum despite a reflective mode. The density of metaphor in some stretches slightly risks saturation, but it does not materially obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are concrete, and most lines do double duty in worldbuilding and character. Figurative language is frequent but largely well-chosen and coherent (“dust motes dancing like memories,” “catechism of resilience”), and it rarely clogs momentum given the piece’s reflective, accumulative design. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler sentences; exposition tends to be dense and purposeful. The main limitation for top-tier scores is that the density of metaphor occasionally edges toward decorative rather than strictly pressure-bearing, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme, and the metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent (“a sound like pages tearing slowly in an empty library”). Figurative language is frequent but not so piled-on as to become purple or obscure causality; momentum holds through the reflective passages. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or syntactic templates, and grammar and pacing are clean. A slight risk of lyrical saturation exists, but it doesn’t materially blunt clarity or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, few redundancies, and a good density of images that often perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and mood at once). Lines like “a place that had seen decades of travelers…each one a story compressed into luggage and hurried footsteps” show controlled, effective figurative work. There is some tendency toward stacked modifiers and repetition of conceptual language (fate, destiny, illuminated moments) that edges into mild purple and could be pared for even more impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are never seriously compromised, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, successfully integrating setting, emotion, and theme in single sentences. However, there is a high density of figurative language and long, winding constructions that occasionally verge on purple and slow momentum at this length. Some redundancies (“temperamental temperament,” repeated thaw metaphors) could be sharpened or trimmed for greater force. Rhythm and clarity remain intact, but line-level discipline could be tightened to meet elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty with image and interiority, and metaphors like “moonlight poured through holes in the ceiling like spilled milk” and “fear lived in her like a second heartbeat” are vivid and largely controlled. There are a few familiar turns (“the irony was not lost on her,” “hit like a coordinated punch”) and patches of density where figurative language crowds in, but they don’t significantly blur sense or pacing. The prose maintains momentum without obvious scaffolding or loops, and the final line lands cleanly. Overall, it’s polished and publication-ready with only minor tendencies toward purple in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences are well-shaped, with varied rhythm and high information density; most lines carry both image and thematic weight without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and not self-contradictory—“topology of shadow” and “language of stones” are strong, integrated metaphors. There is minor redundancy around silence/hush and her lifelong vocation that could be pruned, but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or obscure causality. Grammar and syntax are clean, and the final image lands crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with long, well-shaped sentences that carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, interiority, and image) without collapsing under their own weight. Figurative language—especially around ice, sound, and time—is generally apt and non-redundant, and there are few to no scaffolding sentences or obvious loops. A slight tendency toward conceptual abstraction and repeated constructions (e.g., “should not emerge…yet here the robot stands”) is noticeable but does not seriously impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong images like “water droplets still trembling on the glass surfaces like held tears” and the mirror reflecting another mirror. Sentences generally do double duty—advancing atmosphere and theme together—without obvious redundancy or template cadence. There is a mild tendency toward abstraction and conceptual phrasing (“attribute of being ambiguously clear,” “raw expression of visual truth”), but it doesn’t seriously obscure sense or dull the ending. Rhythm and clarity hold throughout, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Images like “some plants simply needed more time than others to remember how to grow” and “every crack a lesson mended into understanding” are precise and thematically loaded without tipping into purple excess. There are mild reiterations of the same concepts (luck as measurable, cracks as lessons), but they function more as intentional motif than loop. Overall propulsion is gentle yet steady, fitting the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information (“the particular chill of recycled atmosphere” is a good example). Metaphors are mostly apt and consistent with the world (books, breathing rhythms, singing machinery), and syntactic variety keeps the piece from feeling mechanical. There is a mild tendency toward repetition of concepts (“subdued awakenings,” “mechanically warm,” “twilight”) without always adding new pressure, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. No obvious scaffolding or figurative muddle harms the climax image of wings in “beautiful, impossible multiplicity.”

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are largely clean, varied, and purposeful, with strong images (“black water that moved with silent patience,” “last note hung in the air like a question mark”) and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, and syntax flows smoothly without obvious loops or mechanical cadences. A few abstractions and stacked concepts (“transmission, connection”) slightly flatten local texture, but they don’t blur action or stakes. Overall line-level craft is polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density: most sentences carry setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously (“aurora… like a curtain of pale grief,” “a small gray monument to the way truth could be held gently”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and metaphors are internally coherent and thematically aligned. There are no evident loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic monotony; the line-level clarity and momentum remain strong even in reflective passages. At a very high bar, one could trim a few abstractions for even more sharpness, but they do not materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensory, and mostly efficient, with many doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“the darkness had grown thicker and more substantial”). Figurative language is evocative (“sound like distant prayer beads clicked together in an empty church”) and largely coherent, though the density edges toward purple in places. There’s minimal redundancy and no major scaffold, loop, or filter-verb clutter; the prose maintains momentum even in reflective passages. Slight over-explanation of theme and concept keeps this from the very top band but doesn’t materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, mostly lean despite the lyricism, and each paragraph adds new texture or conceptual refinement rather than simple restatement. Imagery is generally fresh and internally consistent (composting knowledge, breathing silence, crumbling peace), and there are few if any real mixed metaphors. There is some repetition of concepts (“across the drift of untold seasons,” “witness”) that feels intentional but slightly risks sameness in cadence. Overall, the piece passes the read-aloud and density tests comfortably; a bit more syntactic variation at peak beats would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and musical, with varied sentence structures and strong sensory choices that often carry multiple functions (scene, mood, and character insight at once). Figurative language is generally controlled and apt, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding; information density stays high without becoming opaque. Some lines lean on abstract phrasing (“continuous unfolding of human capacity for marvel,” “ordinary magic”) that lightly dilute immediacy, but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Overall, the line-level craft is well above typical submission quality, just shy of the most incisive concision.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is tightly controlled, with high information density and images that generally pull their weight; sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony. Metaphors are mostly coherent and purposeful, building a consistent aesthetic rather than lapsing into purple or mixed imagery. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final lines land cleanly without explanatory bloat. A few sentences stack abstractions (re: “reality's architecture,” “axis of wonder”) that could be sharpened, but they don’t materially obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with metaphors that are generally coherent and purposeful (“transposing life into a new key,” “reading the spaces between words”). The prose does double duty, advancing both scene and theme with little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Fortune-cookie aphorisms and conceptual phrasing are frequent but contextually earned by the narrator and premise. A few lines edge toward generalized wisdom rather than sharply embodied perception, which keeps this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and carefully tuned figurative language that usually clarifies rather than obscures (“the first phrase of the Latin chant began its eternal return”). There is a rich metaphor load, but it’s patterned and thematically coherent (loops, thresholds, stitching reality) rather than random ornament, and rhythm adjusts with the pressure of the scene. A slight tendency toward conceptual stacking in a few sentences keeps it just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and mostly avoids redundancy; images like ink from unlived memories and frost-curling words on paper are vivid and memorable. Figurative language is frequent but controlled enough not to muddle sense; metaphors tend to harmonize (music, reflection, spirals) rather than clash. There’s some risk of ornamentation outpacing momentum, yet the piece remains legible and forward-moving in its lyric mode. No evident loops or scaffolding sentences drag the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong, clean images (“between the drop and the ripple,” “flickering across centuries like a candle seen through wind”). Sentences usually carry multiple functions—worldbuilding, mood, and interiority—without feeling padded. There is some conceptual repetition and abstract phrasing (“labyrinth of self,” “procedural generation,” “fragmentation”) that risk slight distance and faint whiffs of exposition-speak, but they don’t seriously harm clarity or momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense or mixed as to blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously) without bogging down. Figurative language is frequent but not yet purple, and it supports rather than obscures clarity. Minor issues—a stray non-English character, and one or two slightly abstract lines in the final paragraph—nibble at the edge of overstatement but do not materially dull the closure. Overall, the line-level craft is well above average and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight, fluent, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Images like “attention heavy and deliberate like the humidity before a thunderstorm” feel apt and grounded in her profession. There is mild redundancy and abstraction (e.g., “credibly curious mind,” and a tendency to restate stakes in conceptual terms) that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness. Line-level rhythm and clarity remain strong throughout, including at the ending, without notable artifacts or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or emotional arc. Images such as “ghostly fluorescence of memories embedded in organic matter” and “tears in their molecular structure” are striking and coherent within the story’s logic. There is mild redundancy and abstraction in the closing thematic explanation, but no major loops, scaffolding, or metaphor muddle that obscure sense or drain momentum. Trimming a few explanatory phrases would sharpen an already strong line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and on-theme, with few mixed metaphors or purple excess. Information density is high, and the prose sustains momentum despite its reflective mode. A slight tendency toward conceptual phrasing in places prevents this from feeling utterly diamond-cut, but it remains well within top-tier quality.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, information-dense, and generally do more than one job, often aligning setting, mood, and character in a single image. Figurative language (“a skeleton of iron and stubbornness,” “a hand reaching from a well”) is apt and rarely over-stacked, and there is minimal paraphrase looping. The prose maintains momentum; even longer sentences feel deliberate rather than padded. A few phrases approach abstraction (“something could still be made to sing”) but do not materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density; many sentences do double or triple duty for mood, character, and theme. Sensory and metaphorical language is often excellent (“the air seemed to hold its breath,” “amber and grief, a melancholy that tasted of autumn leaves and letters never sent”). There is some stacking of abstractions (“experience was the truth,” “useful fiction, emotional medicine coated in sugar”) and conceptual repetition around half truths, empathy vs sympathy, which slightly dulls momentum. Still, there are no serious loops or muddles, and line-level craft is solidly above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences are generally well-shaped, with good variation in length and a clear sense of momentum despite the quiet action. Figurative language (“shelves rose around her like the hull of an inverted ship,” “a soft sound like a whispered secret”) is apt and not overstacked. There is little redundancy or scaffolding, and copy-level errors are absent. A slight leaning toward lyrical comfort over sharp compression keeps it just short of top-tier line work.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, figurative language is controlled and coherent, and most lines do double duty for character and world-building. Phrases like “hollow promise,” “luminescent ache,” and “decision crystallizing like the orchard fruit” are vivid without becoming overwrought. There’s little redundancy or scaffold; exposition is compressed efficiently into a few dense paragraphs. The density of metaphor is high but remains legible and purposeful, so it enriches rather than obscures momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and largely free of scaffolding or paraphrase loops; most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) efficiently. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple, and key images (interrupted cadence, silver-thread canals, the glowing pendant) remain coherent across the piece. Momentum does soften slightly in places where similar ideas about silence and vanishing are reiterated, but not to the point of genuine drag. Line-level craft is comfortably in the publishable range, if not yet dazzling under maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and densely informative without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is rich but controlled, with recurring images (spiraling stones, chipped tiles dovetailing, breathing stone) building a coherent metaphor system rather than feeling like stacked ornament. There are no significant grammatical slips or clunky constructions, and the final paragraph in particular lands with a clean, resonant cadence. At times the prose verges on lush, but it never quite tips into purple or obscures sense, which suits a top-tier literary submission.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically pleasing, and dense with meaning—many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Images such as “hands reading the infrastructure’s language as others might read braille” are precise and effective. There is some repetition and purple tint (e.g., stacked abstractions like “liminal and holy,” “not debris but a covenant, not遗言 but a message”) that risks over-saturation and could be tightened without loss. Despite the lushness, clarity and momentum are preserved; no key beat is obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and metaphor that generally aligns with the story’s botanic frame (“dark clouds gathered… like bruises”). Some lines are lush, but the figurative language is purposeful rather than ornamental, and there is little to no paraphrase looping. The prose supports momentum despite reflection, with key paragraphs pivoting on micro-choices rather than static musing. The final sentence elegantly braids image and concept without muddling clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density; most sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character state. Figurative language (“congregation,” “temple of human stubbornness”) is generally apt and not overstacked, and rhythm shifts gracefully between longer lyric lines and shorter, grounded beats. There are no notable scaffolding loops, syntactic monotony, or clarity issues. At times the diction skirts the edge of purple, but it remains legible and purposeful, especially given the accumulative, textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density and few wasted sentences; images like “sounds hung in the air like visible architecture” are striking without becoming muddled. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and pattern-consistent, and there’s little in the way of paraphrase loops or scaffolding. A couple of metaphors verge on the abstract (“made its own weather of sound,” “steadily unpredictability”) and the thematic realization paragraphs tread close to expository telling. Still, clarity and momentum hold, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding. Imagery like “salt crystals still clung to his notebooks” and “staggered intervals” of vision is concrete and effective. There is minor conceptual repetition around fragments and meaning, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. No noticeable artifacts, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues arise, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong: many sentences carry dual loads of atmosphere and interiority, and the descriptive language is often striking without losing clarity. There is some purple tendency and conceptual repetition (reiterating her analytical/artistic nature; multiple variations of stars-as-holes-in-velvet/vault imagery) that could be tightened without loss. Line-to-line momentum remains intact, and there are few true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. With a slight reduction in explicit abstractions and a sharper paring of repeated motifs, this would approach elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structure and a good balance of concrete image and conceptual language; most lines carry multiple duties (setting, character, and theme) without bulk. Figurative language is generally apt and non-redundant—phrases like “bony finger pointing toward the heavens” and “choir of voices singing in unison” feel earned and coherent. There is a mild tendency toward abstraction in a few spots, but not enough to slow momentum or cloud the closure image. No notable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts undercut clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms, clean syntax, and a good sense of momentum despite the reflective mode. Many lines do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding, and cause/effect remains legible even in dense passages. However, figurative language and abstractions are stacked heavily (“spaces between spaces, the silence between heartbeats, the vast and terrifying absence”), creating occasional purple patches and paraphrase-adjacent repetition of the same cosmic ideas. This density slightly blunts impact at the climax but doesn’t obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is controlled, dense with meaning, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, theme, and character at once). Figurative language is apt and not overstacked, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. There are a few slightly expository or abstract formulations, but they don’t significantly blunt the closure image or obscure cause and effect. Line-level craft is easily at or above publishable standard for a serious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntax varied, and metaphors (time as forest, light as “component lies and truths”) are mostly coherent and resonant. There is some tendency toward density and repetition—phrases like “earnest studious pursuit” and multiple layered metaphors occasionally edge toward purple and slow momentum. Nonetheless, information density is high and scaffolding is minimal; most lines do more than one job. The closure image is not obscured by ornament, even if the prose slightly oversaturates earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and deliberate, with strong information density—most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and character lens at once). Metaphoric language around tides, rust, and layering is coherent and patterned rather than scattershot, and there’s minimal redundancy. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and shorter cadences to land key turns (“But she had not used it.”). It flirts with being slightly over-abstract in places, but it doesn’t tip into muddle or obvious loops.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level variety and a good balance between description and movement. Imagery like “bruised twilight sky” and “whispers of closing pages” is vivid, and most figurative language is coherent and purposeful. There is some mild redundancy and a tilt toward purple/thematic exposition in the final third, where ideas are explained instead of fully embodied. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no major artifacts or loops dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clear, well-paced, and information-dense, with few redundancies; description, interiority, and action often share lines efficiently. The prose is occasionally lush but not incoherent, and metaphors (carnival as “quiet tide” of graffiti, canals carrying “merchants and memories”) are mostly apt and consistent. There are mild tendencies toward abstraction and repetition in later paragraphs (“foundation,” “community,” “tide of change”) that could be sharpened into fresher images. No major scaffolding, template cadence, or figurative muddle interferes with closure, but there is room to trim and electrify key lines.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and generally economical, with strong image-making (“earthlight in strange ways,” frost that “blazed like scattered diamonds”) and a good sense of rhythmic variation. Most sentences do double duty—advancing setting, character, and theme—without obvious padding or boilerplate. There are a few mildly redundant formulations and abstract phrasings that could be tightened, and the density of figurative language edges toward lush in places without quite tipping into purple. Crucially, momentum and clarity stay intact through the close, with the final paragraph landing cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and generally purposeful, with effective images like mist as a “second skin” and light patterns as a language. The explanation of the water-refraction method is dense but mostly efficient, doing worldbuilding and character work simultaneously. There is some mild repetition and near-purple phrasing (“calm and magnetic in the misty silence”) but not enough to bog momentum or obscure sense. Overall, the prose reads polished and publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and often do double duty (advancing character and atmosphere together). Figurative language (condensation as tiny rivers, the lake as a map) is apt and controlled rather than overstacked, and there’s little to no visible scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The rhythm supports the contemplative mode without becoming sluggish, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, charged image. Minor density in descriptive phrasing is intentional and does not obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean despite the lyric register, with few redundancies, and images like “moss had worn the stone to velvet” or the fork’s vibration in marrow are vivid and coherent. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and internally consistent with the resonance motif, so it enhances rather than clutters. There are a couple of moments where abstract phrasing (“system of resonance,” “accumulated pressure”) edges toward conceptual rather than sensory, very slightly flattening momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line craft is polished, with high information density, generally clean syntax, and prose that often carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) per sentence. Some repetition of favored phrases (“gathered hush,” “ephemeral,” “beautiful”) and conceptual language edges toward ornament, and a few sentences could be tightened without loss. Figurative language is mostly apt and coherent, with no major metaphor clashes or clarity failures, and momentum rarely stalls. The overall effect is lush but controlled, just shy of the stripped precision that top-tier venues often demand.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences accomplish multiple tasks (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, with only occasional risk of over-saturation. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences, and the closure image is clean rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-constructed, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, with images like “luminous coffin” and “winter-cracked fields of memory” that feel purposeful rather than decorative. There is some approach to purple prose—nearly every sentence is metaphorically charged—which slightly blurs impact in places but doesn’t obscure clarity or closure. I see no significant repetition, scaffolding, or mechanical errors that would drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful (“veins carrying memory instead of blood,” “orchid solace bloom in her chest”), with good rhythmic variety and high information density. At times, figurative layers stack—ruin/reverence/precedent/orchid/ghosts—so densely they risk purple overload, and a few abstractions repeat (ruin to reverence, broken precedent) without adding pressure. Nonetheless, clarity remains solid and the closure image is not muddied by metaphor. A firmer knife on redundancy and a touch more plainness in key beats would elevate this to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, vivid, and efficient; most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, mood, and character all at once) without feeling overworked. Figurative language is present but well-chosen and not stacked to the point of purple excess, and there’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony. Rhythm modulates appropriately between longer, meditative sentences and tighter, action-oriented lines as she excavates and then ascends. Minor tweaks could further sharpen concision, but there are no artifacts that obscure meaning or blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, with high information density and few, if any, true redundancies or scaffolding phrases. The imagery is generally clear and evocative, and rhythmic control is evident across paragraphs. There is a mild tendency toward lushness in nearly every line, which risks softening momentum in the absence of strong plot pressure, but it doesn’t cross into muddled purple prose. Overall, the prose is notably above average and nearly publication-ready as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images are precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and theme) without slack. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, with only occasional phrases tipping toward mild purple (“whispered secrets finally given breath,” “labyrinth of adjacent possibilities”). There is little redundancy or scaffolding; the prose maintains momentum despite a predominantly contemplative mode. No noticeable artifacts or syntactic glitches mar the closure beat, which lands with a clean, evocative image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and generally dense with meaning—most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding + emotion, or image + theme). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and on-theme, and there are few if any true scaffolding or repetition artifacts. A couple of lines lean toward abstraction or familiar phrasing (“demanded nothing and offered everything,” “finally, impossibly, arrived”), slightly dulling immediacy in crucial beats. Overall momentum is maintained well for a reflective piece, and clarity never suffers from the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty in scene-setting and thematic work; there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent ('blue dust on the road,' 'lotus-hearted and ancient'), and rhythm varies well across longer and shorter lines. A few phrases verge on lush ('terrible poetry,' 'eternal, misty embrace') but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image. Syntax, grammar, and sequencing are clean, supporting momentum despite the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, musical, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and on-theme; metaphors extend rather than collide, and there’s no purple muddle at the climax. Nearly every line advances setting, character, or theme, and there’s minimal redundancy. The cadence of the final paragraph—light fading, fragment darkening, joy persisting—lands cleanly and memorably.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology, and information density is high without bloat. Metaphors (e.g., echoes like light through water) are apt and not overstacked; the prose rarely lapses into true purple. There are small issues—one infelicitous verb choice/typo (“bewitch” where “bewitched” is intended) and occasional abstract phrasing toward the end—that slightly blunt sharpness. Overall momentum and clarity are maintained, and there’s little scaffold or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally sharp and high-density: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme) without obvious scaffold or repetition, and the ear-rhythm is varied. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and on-theme (taxable thoughts, paperwork-eating insects, roots drinking rebellion) rather than showy for its own sake. There are minor redundancies (the “particular warmth”/“particular candidcryptic quality” pattern) and a few near-purple lines, but they do not materially slow momentum or blur closure. Copy-level control is strong; syntax and references are clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is often beautiful, dense, and multi-functional; many sentences carry character, setting, and theme simultaneously. There is some mild overwriting and metaphor clustering (greenhouse, reef-shadow, bioluminescence, blossoms) that risks feeling slightly plush and repetitive, especially around the grief→beauty transformation. Still, clarity is maintained and there’s little true scaffold or synonym-loop padding. Tighter pruning of a few metaphors would move this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong image-making and generally efficient sentences that each carry atmosphere or concept. There is noticeable density of metaphor and abstraction, but it rarely collapses into muddle or redundancy, and the logic of images holds. A few phrases verge on purple or explanatory repetition (“She understood regret the way a gardener understands the seasons”) and could be tightened for even sharper impact. Overall, line-level craft is high, just shy of the spareness and surprise that would mark truly elite work.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clean, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for character, atmosphere, and theme. There is a consistent musical metaphor system (symphonies, fugue, cadence) that holds together rather than mixing incoherently. However, the sheer saturation of figurative language and abstract nouns (“harmonic resonance of meaning,” “interconnected promise”) occasionally slows momentum and risks purple prose. Trimming a few redundancies and abstractions would sharpen impact and lift this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with tools and environment often doing double duty for character and theme. However, the prose occasionally leans toward purple, with frequent metaphors and abstractions (“dappled resolve,” “eternal negotiation between geological pressure and architectural integrity”) that risk over-saturation. There is some conceptual repetition around harmony, negotiation, and dormancy that could be tightened without loss. Despite this, momentum holds and the closure image remains sharp and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing double duty for world, character, and theme (“vanilla and forgetting,” “specific grief that settles into floorboards”). Figurative language is mostly clean and controlled; metaphors extend rather than collide, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. A few abstractions (“shape of healing she had been unable to name”) skim close to generalization but are grounded enough in surrounding concrete detail. Momentum holds despite the reflective mode, and the closure image is sharp and undulled by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely efficient: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) without obvious scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is generally coherent and apt (“grain ran in crooked rivers,” “diagram drawn in the new weather”), and the rhythm reads smoothly aloud. There is some tendency toward conceptual repetition and near-abstract phrasing in the final third, edging toward over-explication, but it doesn’t materially obscure closure or drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: varied sentence structures, high information density, and images that usually do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and disciplined, rarely slipping into mixed metaphors or redundancy. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric, reflective piece; there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. At times the density of metaphor risks slight overrichness, but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and figurative language that remains coherent and sensorial (“residue of things not yet forgotten,” “map drawn in water”). Prose rhythm adapts well between description, process, and emotional beats without obvious loops or template cadences. Metaphor density is high in places but stays legible and thematically aligned rather than purple. Minor tightening could further sharpen a few reflective sentences, but momentum and clarity never meaningfully suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, clean syntax, and a high density of purposeful detail; most lines do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Metaphors are mostly apt (tide as rhythm, billiard balls as “tiny moons”), and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A few formulations tilt toward abstraction or conceptual repetition (e.g., multiple formulations of ordered randomness and calculation-as-intuition), but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Line-level craft is publication-ready, if more cerebral than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. There are some beautiful, clean images (“salt in rain,” “obsidian grace of deep water holding the moon’s reflection without breaking it”). Yet figurative language is nearly constant, especially in the middle, so moments blur together rather than sharpening, and a few phrases feel like soft abstractions or paraphrase loops of the same insight. Trimming a handful of overtly explanatory lines would heighten impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, with images doing multiple jobs (e.g., the “pond remembers how to speak in circles” both visualizes and thematically charges the moment). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, and there are few to no paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences. A couple of phrases (“noctilucent reckonings,” “reading the ripples like scripture”) flirt with ornamental abstraction, but they don’t seriously cloud clarity or momentum. Overall, the prose reads polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (character, setting, theme) with little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors (“color of old maps,” “landscape of her survival,” “hard softness”) are coherent and reinforce a consistent image system without piling into purple excess. Syntax varies, and paragraphs are lean; nearly every line advances mood or understanding. A few formulations verge on abstraction (“universal language,” “bargaining”) but do not significantly blur the closure image or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are generally clean and grammatically sound, and many lines do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme). Yet there is noticeable repetition in both concepts and phrasing (“patient,” “tide-polished,” “logical dreamer,” “systematic effort,” etc.), and a tendency to restate the same idea in adjacent sentences with minor variation. Figurative language is safe rather than surprising, and long abstract constructions occasionally sap momentum. The prose is solid but needs tightening and more varied texture to reach a prestigious-literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and usually carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without slipping into bloat. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and not confusing; only occasionally does it approach purple without adding pressure. There are no major scaffold loops or redundancy that sap momentum in this quiet mode. A small language error aside, prose is polished and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“like smoke finding its way through stone walls,” “dusky harmony”) and generally high information density. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so overloaded as to obscure meaning. Redundancies are minimal, and sentence-level clarity and grammar are clean. The style occasionally risks purple but never quite tips into muddle, maintaining momentum for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and generally strong, specific images (the clipboard catching the first stars, names filling “three generations with grief”). Rhythm varies and there is little to no scaffolding or redundant looping; almost every sentence does multiple jobs. That said, the piece edges toward purple in places—stacked metaphors like “terrace held its breath,” “sun bled into night,” “celestial dance,” “geometry of loss”—which can feel slightly over-textured for a high-stakes diplomatic scene. The figurative language remains coherent, but trimming a few flourishes would tighten momentum and push the craft nearer to elite minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: clear syntax, good sentence variety, and high information density with images that do more than one job. Key metaphors (echoes, dried riverbeds as maps, the translucent egg) are coherent and not over-stacked. There are minor instances of stock phrasing and near-redundant conceptual statements, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only light tightening and cliché-trimming needed.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with high-density imagery and layered sentences that do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme). Phrases like “lullaby of conformity,” “spiritual residue,” and “collective surrender” recur in slightly abstract, essayistic ways, and figurative density is occasionally higher than needed, which risks softening momentum. Nonetheless, there are few true loops or muddled metaphors, and the final images land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level writing is strong, with vivid metaphors, varied syntax, and good information density—most sentences pull double duty in atmosphere and character. Phrases like the radar dome as a “fallen celestial eye” and the story stick “recognizing” the meteor moment show controlled, evocative figurative work. There is some risk of over-saturation in abstractions around ethics and story, but clarity and momentum remain intact and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts. A touch more restraint in the final didactic paragraphs would sharpen impact, but the craftsmanship is otherwise publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but generally precise; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding and theme, or action and emotion) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are coherent and apt, and there’s no noticeable synonym churn or template cadence. A few phrases flirt with abstraction or slight overstatement, but they do not obscure cause and effect or dull the closing image. Line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier venues with only light tightening needed, not rethinking.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and generally economical, with most sentences advancing both atmosphere and character. Motifs like ice, aurora, breath, and rope recur in a controlled way that builds texture rather than redundancy. At times the language leans into a slightly abstract, essayistic register that risks softening immediacy, but it never fully lapses into purple or incoherent metaphor. Line-level rhythm supports the meditative pace, and there are no obvious scaffolding or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty (worldbuilding plus interiority or theme). A few phrases feel slightly overworked or redundant, but there’s no heavy scaffolding, synonym churn, or figurative muddle that obscures sense. The prose sustains momentum through long sentences without losing clarity, and errors/typos are minimal. Overall, it’s polished enough for serious consideration, though tightening a few abstractions would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful: most sentences carry more than one job, and there’s good rhythm between exposition and image. Phrases like “The empirical irony of this discovery settled into Maruk's bones like winter cold” marry concept and embodiment effectively. There are minor slips—occasional abstraction, a typo (“duskyaccord”) and a tense error (“has restored”)—and some thematic points are reiterated where compression would suffice. Still, there is no serious looping or figurative muddle, and line-level craft is solidly above average.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is tight and imagistic, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, mood, and theme (e.g., “walls breathed with borrowed time,” “bitterness that had become his architecture”). Rhythm and syntax vary naturally and support momentum; there’s little dead scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative density occasionally flirts with purple and includes a couple of familiar abstractions (“poisoned the vessel that carried it”), but clarity and propulsion remain intact. The final lines land cleanly and musically without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, and images like “breath against glass” and fog as a “membrane” are precise and apt. There is some repetition of conceptual language (boundary, threshold, membrane) but it functions as motif rather than scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative density is high yet controlled; metaphors remain coherent and don’t snarl the sense, and there’s little deadwood or paraphrase. The prose is strong enough for competitive venues, though a slight trimming of explanatory abstraction could make it even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, emotion), the rhythm varies, and most metaphors are clear and apt. A few lines flirt with purple or redundancy and tilt toward telling (“This was the deciduous vows made manifest, she thought”; the explicit summary of her thematic lesson), but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. There’s no apparent scaffolding, awkward syntax, or confusing figurative language. Overall, the prose feels polished and publishable with only minor tightening of explicit abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally elegant and high-density, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and interiority. Metaphors are frequent but mostly controlled and sensical, and rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraph blocks readable. There is some redundancy and mild purple strain (multiple similes for time and realization, a few abstract summaries) that could be tightened for maximal impact. Still, clarity is never lost, and the closure image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and theme) with few redundancies, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum in a reflective piece. Imagery is vivid (“quiet vibration of accumulated words,” “wounds that could not be healed”) and metaphor chains remain coherent rather than mixed. There is some density of abstraction and high-register phrasing that could be pared for even greater sharpness, but it rarely obscures sense or blunts the closure image. Line-level craft is close to publishable as is.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, dense, and usually multi-functional, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; images tend to be coherent and thematically aligned rather than flashy for their own sake. A few abstractions (“unkindled solace,” “blissful aberration”) risk slight distance or pseudo-philosophical haze, but they don’t seriously obscure action or causality. Momentum is modest by design but not bogged down by excess verbiage.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and sensory specificity; many sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and characterization. Occasional abstractions and repeated thematic formulations (“fables of absence,” “absence could be as eloquent as presence”) skirt purple but remain intelligible and purposeful. Momentum holds throughout, and there are no major loops or muddled metaphors that obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and action) without obvious scaffolding or loops, and rhythm varies to suit description versus climax. Figurative language (“nothing-song,” “hammered repose,” cracks like frost) is vivid and controlled, with no mixed or overextended metaphors. Information is dense but clear; each paragraph advances situation or deepens the stakes rather than circling. I see no grammatical or sequencing issues, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong rhythmic control and high information density—many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. At times it edges toward purple, stacking abstractions (“quality of peace,” “spaces between thoughts,” “communion of souls”) and slightly over-explaining the metaphysical stakes. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained; there are few redundancies, and the final image is not obscured by figurative muddle. Line-level craft is strong but could benefit from a touch more concreteness and occasional pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“where the sky opened like a wound and the fog solidified into walkable memory” is exemplary). There is some risk of overwriting—multiple long, metaphor-rich sentences in close succession and occasional conceptual repetition (e.g., restating the nature of collective memory). Momentum is more contemplative drift than propulsion, but clarity is maintained throughout. Tightening a few abstract or redundant phrases would sharpen impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, with strong verbs, concrete nouns, and a generally efficient density that does multiple jobs per sentence. There is some figurative richness (“hope itself had developed its own gravity,” “serious playfulness”) but it rarely tips into muddle or purple. A few concepts are reiterated (“controlled combustion,” the serious/absurd nature of fire arts) where trimming could increase tautness. Overall momentum and clarity remain high, and the closure image is crisp and undiluted.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and largely economical, with many sentences doing double duty for mood, character, and theme. Metaphors (tide, stone-carved cathedral, cicada life cycle) are coherent and reinforce one another rather than clashing. There is some conceptual repetition around “transition periods” and liminal spaces that could be trimmed for maximum impact, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. Line-level clarity is high, and the closing cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and high-density, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are vivid and mostly coherent, and there is little factual or syntactic clutter. That said, some lines verge on purple or redundant, such as the “second skin too tight and too loose” pattern echoing later paradox formulations and the repeated “intangibly tangible,” which slightly blurs sharpness. Overall momentum holds, but trimming a few ornamental phrases would make an already strong line-level performance sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm and imagery are well-controlled, with line-level work doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“a hush waiting to learn how to comfort”). Figurative language is rich but not incoherent; metaphors of rooms, cathedrals, and weather echo each other rather than clash. There is minor repetition around concepts of silence and hush, but it reads as intentional motif rather than scaffolding. The prose remains clear and propulsive enough for this quiet, lyric mode, with no major loops or artifacts dulling the close.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with good rhythm and multi-functional sentences that build both world and mood. A few lines verge on purple or abstract (“a world that had learned to dream in circuits and poetry simultaneously”) but remain coherent. There are no major redundancy loops or structural artifacts, though the density of figurative description could be trimmed slightly in places to sharpen momentum. Overall, line craft is publishable but just shy of the most distilled, surprising precision.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: dense but not bloated, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme. There is some repetition of key terms (“careful,” “suffocation,” “burning bridges”) that borders on insistent, and a few abstractions could be sharpened into more sensory particulars. Minor mechanical blemishes (e.g., “extinguishinG”) and occasional conceptual restatements slightly dull the edge. Still, rhythm and clarity hold, and the closing cadence is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and rhythmic, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Metaphors (“glowed faintly blue…like something breathing underground,” “hung like frozen waterfalls”) are controlled and coherent, enhancing rather than obscuring sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the narrative moves forward with good momentum for a contemplative piece. A mild density of figurative language skirts the edge of lushness but doesn’t tip into muddle or purple, even at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are well-shaped, rhythm varies, and most images are precise and coherent, often doing double duty for setting and mood. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and thematically apt; there are no serious mixed metaphors or obfuscating flourishes. Information density is strong and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. The main restraint at this level is that the uniformly ornate style slightly blurs dynamism in higher-pressure beats, though it never collapses clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with varied sentence structures, clean syntax, and images that pull double duty for mood and theme. Phrases like “fruit hang like frozen stars” and “preserved in amber” are effective and clear. There is some repetition of conceptual vocabulary (“possibility,” “eternal,” “alchemical”) and a tendency toward slightly purple constructions (“factually mystical quality,” “eternal, alchemical fruiting”) that could be tightened for maximal impact. Still, clarity and momentum are never seriously compromised, and there are no evident scaffolding or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful, with high information density and images that do multiple jobs (the button as both artifact and emotional compass). However, there’s a tendency toward overlong sentences and stacked abstractions that occasionally blur clarity and slow momentum. Minor glitches (“examining unknown the evidence,” “eyes that held examinations unknown”) and a touch of purple density in places keep this just short of top-tier line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty in advancing plot and atmosphere (“the stars emerged, glittering in the dark water like scattered codes waiting to be deciphered”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few mixed metaphors or redundancies, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences. Line-level clarity remains high even in more lyrical passages, and the final image lands crisply. It’s strong, publication-ready craft with only minor risk of abstraction here and there.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient: images often do double duty for mood, worldbuilding, and theme, and there are few, if any, true scaffold or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent and sustained (sound vs silence, breath vs mist, light vs code) without slipping into muddle, and sentence rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. A couple of formulations (“vested hush,” “quietly vivid”) flirt with ornamental repetition, yet they function as motifs rather than padding. Overall, line-level craft is strong, musical, and publication-ready with minimal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for world-building and mood, and it generally maintains clarity of action. Some lines edge toward purple or slightly redundant phrasing, and a couple of grammatical slips and minor repetitions (“always…always,” “she prod”) feel like unpolished artifacts rather than deliberate effects. There’s a modest tendency to stack imagery in calm moments, but it doesn’t seriously impede momentum at this length. With a tighter pass to clean small errors and trim a few overlush spots, this would be ready for a high-level venue.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (characterization + atmosphere + motion), with minimal redundancy. Phrasing such as “worn smooth by countless footsteps now forgotten” is precise and evocative without tipping into purple. There are a few slightly repetitive constructions (two nearly identical “swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse” sentences) but they don’t materially harm momentum or clarity. Overall rhythm, grammar, and sequencing are clean and publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing the process while deepening emotion or theme (e.g., “When she poured the gold, it moved like honey into wounds”). Imagery is vivid but mostly controlled; metaphors stay within a coherent palette of metal, elements, and bodies, avoiding mixed or overwrought constructions. There are a few mild redundancies and slightly abstract phrases (“luminous regret,” “formula for transmutation beyond any she had mastered”) that could be streamlined, but they do not stall momentum or blur sense. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, though another pass could trim a bit of explicative phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished and musical, with varied sentence rhythms and a high density of meaningful images; most sentences carry more than one function (worldbuilding, emotion, tone). The metaphoric language is frequent but generally coherent and earned, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. There is a mild tendency toward purple prose (“luminous ache itself,” “music made of tears”), which could be tightened slightly without loss of effect. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closing cadence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme) without redundancy, and imagery is striking yet coherent. Metaphors (“anesthesia dissolved like sugar in rain,” “time had become a rubber band”) are apt and not overstacked to the point of blur. There are no significant scaffold loops or template cadences, and grammar and sequencing remain clear despite the density. A very slight tendency toward conceptual phrasing in the last paragraph is the only thing that keeps this from the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional shading. Figurative language (“corridor of visible intuition,” “voice thin as paper”) is fresh and coherent, rarely tipping into purple or mixed metaphor. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; momentum is maintained even through reflective passages. A few formulations are a bit ornate relative to the scene’s quiet stakes, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty with atmosphere and characterization. Metaphors like “frozen lightning” and “like cigarette smoke in old wallpaper” are apt and not over-stacked to the point of muddle. There’s minimal redundancy, and the narrative flows smoothly without noticeable scaffolding. A few lines flirt with purple (“its stored energy sensing a narrative about to unwind”), but they don’t significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level writing is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and mostly free of redundancy, with figurative language that holds together conceptually. Prose momentum never stalls, despite the lyricism, and each paragraph adds either world-building, character context, or forward motion. The only noticeable blemish is the stray character in “its运作 required no negotiation,” which reads as a minor typographical artifact rather than a systemic issue. Overall, the piece easily clears professional standards for clarity, rhythm, and concision.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion or theme). Metaphors are coherent and on-theme (time as liquid, sediment, shards) and avoid mixed-vehicle confusion; there’s little scaffold or repetition. The prose is lush but mostly stops short of purple, maintaining clarity even in high-concept descriptions. A slight tendency toward stacked abstraction in the final third (revolutions, truths, civilizations) is the main limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level writing is strong: images like “silence that gathered like rust around a truth left unspoken” and the orchestrion’s first note “like a flower remembering the sun” are vivid and coherent. Sentences generally carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There is some density of figurative language, but it stays consistent in register and rarely feels purple or confusing. The closure beat is clear and uncluttered, allowing the final image to land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and structure, carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme) at once, and maintain clarity despite figurative richness. There’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding; nearly every line advances atmosphere or concept. While imagery is dense, it rarely tips into muddled or mixed metaphor, and the rhythm supports the gradual deepening toward the lagoon. A very small trim of abstract phrasing in the final paragraph could sharpen impact, but as-is the prose meets high-tier literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid images ("late afternoon to bruised twilight," "turbine-hum reverie") and efficient, multipurpose sentences that carry both atmosphere and character. There are no major loops or scaffolding; the prose moves forward with good momentum for a reflective piece. Some late sentences tilt into high-level abstraction and thematic labeling, slightly blurring the sensory immediacy achieved earlier. With a light trim of those authorial-feeling lines and a touch more concrete anchoring at the end, the prose would be near publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatically clean, images coherent, and most lines carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding. The prose does verge on densely ornamental, with frequent figurative turns (“amber glow,” “soft, umbral tenderness,” “scattered diamonds”) that sometimes feel redundant rather than escalatory. However, rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the closure image of the garden and bulbs is clear and un-muddled. A slight trim of modifiers and repeated texture would sharpen momentum without altering meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, sensory density, and very few wasted sentences; images like “a patient whale” and memories “like an insect trapped in amber” are striking yet legible. Descriptive richness borders on ornate but largely avoids purple excess and maintains momentum. The main craft compromise is the summarizing of the grandmother’s speech, which trades some emotional sharpness for concision. There are no evident loops, scaffold phrases, or figurative muddles that impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is tight, rhythmically varied, and generally high-density: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, character, theme) without bloat. Figurative language is controlled and coherent—images like “a sketch drawn in fog” or “the amber glow of pure memory” clarify rather than obscure. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the line-level work never muddies causality or the closure image. A few abstract phrases verge on essayistic, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept; figurative language (“promises accumulated like sediment”) is apt and controlled rather than piled on. Rhythm varies well across longer, meditative lines and sharper, declarative ones, especially around the moment of realization about the foghorn’s purpose. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax remains clear despite lyric ambition. A few metaphors lightly echo familiar registers, but none blur sense or slow momentum in a way that touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and generally strong rhythm; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is controlled but abundant, occasionally approaching purple (“roots had touched the edges of memory itself,” “time to double back upon itself like a river seeking its source”) without quite breaking clarity. There is some conceptual repetition around “entropy,” “vortex,” and lineage that could be tightened slightly. Still, momentum largely holds, syntax varies, and the final lines land with clarity and weight.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is precise and controlled, with varied sentence rhythms and images that generally carry both atmosphere and information (“the siren rose like a dawn” is emblematic). Exposition is efficiently braided into action and perception, avoiding clunky scaffolding or synonym loops. A few phrases verge on abstraction (“atmospheric instability,” “statistical anomaly”), but they fit the technical lens rather than reading as filler. Overall, every paragraph does multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—with little wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and a generally smooth read-aloud rhythm. Some passages verge on purple or redundant, stacking similar abstractions (“strength… vulnerable openness… sacred importance”) and slowing momentum. There are no serious clarity issues or mixed metaphors, but conceptual repetition slightly dulls the closure image. Overall, the line-level work is strong but not yet at the rarefied, razor-edited level of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, and theme) without padding, and the figurative language is rich but not chaotic. Phrases like “weight of unspoken words” recur purposefully rather than as synonym churn, and there are no notable logical slips or clarity issues. A few abstractions (“covenant too fragile for speech”) edge toward the poetic-general but are grounded enough in the concrete images around them. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum in a quiet, accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant, with good sentence rhythm and high information density—many lines do double duty for setting and theme. Some metaphors and abstractions (“post-numerical economy of meaning,” “numbers stopped meaning what they used to”) border on overdecorated, and a few thematic sentences paraphrase one another. Still, clarity is maintained, and the closure image is not muddied by figurative excess. Minor tightening of repeated conceptual phrasing would elevate already strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry image, mood, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is generally precise (“green so deep it seemed to hold captured twilight”) and few metaphors feel strained. There is some mild overwriting and repetition in the thematic exposition paragraphs, where abstract nouns (“completeness,” “conversation of becoming”) accumulate and slow momentum. The mislabeling of the feather as a drake’s tail and then a kingfisher’s plume is a small factual/consistency slip that pricks the otherwise smooth surface.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, information-dense, and do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, characterization, and theme often share a line). Imagery is rich but not overstacked, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The few abstractions (“proper distribution of energy,” “ongoing conversation”) are anchored in concrete images nearby. A touch more variation in sentence structure at a few points would sharpen propulsion, but the prose is already at publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and fluent, with strong sensory images and a good sense of rhythm at the paragraph level; most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, theme, and character at once). There is some tendency toward abstraction and purple diction, especially in the closing paragraphs where concepts like “convergence” and “gravity of meaning” stack up and slightly dilute impact. A few thematic points are reiterated in near-synonymous phrasing, which could be trimmed for greater sharpness and momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is never in doubt, and the line-level craft is above-average and publication-ready with light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is controlled, and most metaphors are coherent and on-theme. Information density is high, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and theme. There is some mild purple-prose stacking and recurring phrases (“submerged concord,” “battlefield,” “concordance”) that verge on redundancy, and there’s a noticeable typo (“fertilizeed”). These are minor enough that they don’t harm closure, but they keep the piece short of elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight and evocative, with good rhythm and high information density—most sentences are doing double duty for world, mood, and character. Metaphors (“like a wound that refused to heal,” “wild hush”) are mostly coherent and aligned with the world, though there is some risk of mild purple prose and conceptual repetition (distance/translation/love) in the closing section. There are no major scaffold loops or syntactic templates that bog momentum. The lyricism is strong, but a demanding editor would trim a few abstract restatements to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly lean, syntactically varied, and do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). Recurrent metaphors around stretching, echoes, and north are consistent rather than muddled, and there is little in the way of visible scaffolding or repetition that drags momentum. A few phrases veer toward purple or generalized abstraction, especially in the closing moral statements, but clarity remains intact. Overall, the prose is solidly publication-ready, though not yet dazzlingly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The first version shows strong line-level craft: sentences are varied, images like “secrets…waiting like trapped birds” are vivid, and description usually pulls double duty for mood and worldbuilding. There is some redundancy between the two passes, and a few phrases nudge toward purple (“churning violet sky… bruise-purple”) but stop short of real muddle. The restart compresses earlier specificity into plainer strokes, creating a noticeable quality drop that reads like self-edit on the page. Overall rhythm and clarity hold, but the duplication and meta break sap some momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (setting, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Metaphors are controlled and internally consistent, with repetition (“luminous absence,” “nomadic shadows”) serving as pattern rather than loop. Rhythm and paragraphing maintain momentum in what is essentially a static scene, avoiding purple overgrowth. A slight tendency toward elevated diction keeps it just shy of flawless, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences generally carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm varies smoothly between long, sinuous lines and shorter emphatic ones. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and integrated (mountain as body, gift as seed/garden, reflections as doorway), avoiding mixed or contradictory images. There are mild hints of purple in places and a few abstract nouns (“architecture of grief,” “vocabulary of healing”) that gesture toward concept rather than scene, but they don’t meaningfully obscure sense or momentum. Overall, the text reads cleanly and would require minimal line-editing.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and interiority) without obvious padding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with only occasional abstraction (“decorative falsehoods”) that slightly blurs immediacy. There are no serious rhythm artifacts, redundancy loops, or grammatical slips, and the final cadence is clean. The prose approaches—but does not quite tip into—purple; a few strategic cuts could make it razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant, dense, and purposeful: images like the towers as “white pillars…smooth as skin” and the heart “hammered…like something wanting escape” do multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and exposition is folded into image and action rather than delivered as scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors are thematically aligned with bone, silence, and breath. A few abstract phrasings (“price of forgiveness,” “destroyer of careful lies”) recur enough to feel slightly slogan-like, which keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level writing is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere, character, and theme (“Each pockmark became a chapter, each chapter became a bead on the chain of meaning…”). Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to sustain momentum, and the imagery is cohesive (scars, metal, memory, acid, and light-through-cracks). There is some repetitiveness in the thematic vocabulary (uncertainty, meaning, kintsugi) and a mild tendency toward purple prose, especially in the final paragraph, which slightly dulls impact. Nonetheless, clarity never fully suffers, and there’s little true scaffolding or looping.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied in length, and densely informative, with few wasted beats. Imagery around light, water, and reflection is coherent and motif-driven rather than decorative. There is some repetition of similar conceptual phrases about isolation, surrender, and permanence that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness, and a few lines lean into abstract summarizing instead of fresh concrete image. No serious artifacts or muddled metaphors interfere with clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied syntax, clean mechanics, and high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously. Metaphors are apt and mostly non-redundant; the jasmine-as-confession and heat-as-fever images are particularly effective. There is some tendency toward figurative stacking (“bruised clouds,” “wounded stars,” “screaming tenderness”) that risks purple if pushed further, but here it remains just on the lush side of controlled. I see no major loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues that impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and dense with information, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion without obvious scaffolding. Metaphor and abstraction recur (geography/cartography of loss, currents of grief) but stay coherent rather than mixed, and there’s little true redundancy or synonym churn. A few lines verge on thematic summary, yet they don’t significantly drag momentum in such a contemplative, lyric piece. The closing paragraph in particular lands with an image-forward cadence that feels earned and rhythmically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are purposeful, rhythmically varied, and often do double duty for worldbuilding and characterization. Imagery around roots, storms, and networks is coherent and controlled, with little in the way of mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Information density is high without significant drag; even reflective passages are anchored in concrete stimuli (the ravine, the glass eye, the textbooks). There is some conceptual abstraction, but it rarely obscures sense or closure, and no obvious scaffolding artifacts appear.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a strong ear for sonic and imagistic texture. Most lines do at least two jobs—advancing scene while layering atmosphere or character interiority—minimizing scaffold and redundancy. There is a tendency toward density of metaphor and adjective (“softly persistent waves,” “encroaching dark,” “witnessed isolation”), which edges into purple but remains coherent rather than muddled. No major loops or artifacts blunt the closure image, though a slight trimming of modifiers would improve propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful: most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without padding, and figurative language is controlled and apt (“choices accumulated like sediment” stands out). There are no evident loops, template cadences, or clarity issues; the action of moving through the cavern and approaching the door reads cleanly. The diction leans elevated but remains coherent with the character and tone, never straying into purple for its own sake. A few sentences edge toward density, yet they do not materially slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple jobs at once, and maintain clarity despite ornate diction. Metaphors mostly cohere and suit the world, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. There is some purple-leaning phrasing (“cape made of spiderwebs and threat,” “lacy menace”) that pushes toward excess without adding new pressure. Still, the prose largely propels rather than bogs the piece, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, the prose bears substantial conceptual weight without collapsing, and there’s very little true redundancy. Metaphors around spirals, density, and embers mostly cohere and reinforce one another rather than forming a muddled stack. The piece skirts the edge of purple in places—figurative language is frequent and occasionally abstract—but rhythm and clarity are maintained. Nearly every line does multiple jobs (image, theme, character), which sustains momentum despite the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied in length and cadence, and most lines carry multiple functions (image, theme, and character all at once). Figurative language is dense but generally precise and legible; metaphors like “a lighthouse that illuminates only the rocks waiting to destroy you” and “time moved like a drunk dancer” are vivid without collapsing into mush. There is some risk of purple richness, but it stays just on the controlled side and doesn’t produce loops or redundancy that drag momentum. The final paragraphs land with clarity despite their lyric density, preserving the closure image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and efficient, with strong images like the fog pressing against windows and clocks as “small hearts” that carry multiple functions (setting, mood, theme). Sentences vary rhythmically and rarely feel redundant or padded, and figurative language is largely coherent and well chosen. The malformed sentence (“The humanize through occluded views...”) is a significant blemish in an otherwise polished passage, and a couple of lines edge toward soft cliché (“ordinary miracle”). Those issues keep the line-level craft just below the very top tier but it remains solidly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence structures, high information density, and few if any true redundancies; images like “a gray wall of waiting thunder” and “shed memories” are striking. Prose occasionally borders on purple or abstract (“grief and beauty had nowhere to go but inward”) but remains legible and thematically aligned. There are no major loops, scaffold sentences, or figurative muddles that obscure action or closure. Slight trimming of repetitive storm/breath motifs and a few explanatory phrases could sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double or triple duty (advancing setting, theme, and emotion at once) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically aligned; images like “chainsaws sleep in trucks” and “manuscript…like letters never sent” are fresh rather than purple. There are a few slightly dense phrases that flirt with over-ornamentation, but they don’t obscure sense or stall momentum. The opening and closing lines land with precision, recharging earlier motifs without explanatory padding.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with imagery; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding and mood, or concept and character). A few phrases verge on redundancy or purple (e.g., reiterating time’s loss of meaning), but not enough to seriously drag momentum. Information remains clear despite abstraction, and syntax is clean. Overall, this is strong line-level work that could benefit from a touch more spareness where ideas repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: imagery (“living thing holding its breath,” “water seeking its level, measuring itself against itself”) is evocative and mostly precise, and there’s little wasted scaffolding. A few phrases flirt with purple or redundancy (e.g., repeating “razor” imagery, stacking abstractions like “quality of silence” + “living thing” + “anticipation”) but they don’t seriously obscure sense. The prose maintains momentum for a reflective piece, each line doing atmospheric or thematic work. There are no glaring artifacts, loops, or syntactic tics that dull the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is considered, and the prose often achieves multi-layered work (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion at once). There is some density of abstraction and repeated conceptual phrasing (“permeable barriers,” “particular physics”) that edges toward over-articulation but doesn’t seriously bog momentum. Imagery is generally coherent and fresh, with the mycelium metaphor sustained rather than scattered. No significant loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles interfere with clarity or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (setting, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language—“amber quiet,” “clover melancholy,” “addition of losses that might yet become multiplication of meaning”—is inventive and generally coherent with the math/grief frame. While the style is lush, it stops short of purple; rhythm and paragraphing preserve momentum, and closure is sharp and clear. I see no major artifacts or repetition that would dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with information and often do double duty, advancing atmosphere and theme without much scaffolding. Figurative language is generally precise and apt (“phones below began to ring,” “careers that had slipped through their fingers like water”), and there are no significant redundancies or structural artifacts. The prose does flirt with purple in places, stacking metaphors (“artery…beneath the city’s veins,” “made of some material that felt neither quite glass nor crystal but something between”) but it maintains clarity and rhythm. Slight tightening of a few over-elaborate constructions would bring it nearer to elite-line polish.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, emotion) with minimal redundancy, and metaphors (tea steeping, photographs developing) are coherent and extended rather than stacked haphazardly. There is some density of figurative language throughout, but it’s controlled and pattern-consistent, not purple for its own sake. I see only minor conceptual overlap (“haunted euphoria” and similar phrases return but are doing work), and the final paragraph lands clearly. Trimming a few explanatory clauses could further sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong and economical, with several elegant turns of phrase and a good balance between scene and reflection. A few sentences veer toward essayistic abstraction or repeat concepts (“improbable”/“rumor chains”/“reciprocity”) in ways that lightly dilute momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is high, syntax varies, and the final sentence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, information-dense, and often do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“ultrasonic cathedral,” “pause of shifting constellations”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme, with few mixed or confusing metaphors. There is some tendency toward saturation—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or heightened phrase—which risks slight purple-ness and could benefit from occasional plainer lines to sharpen contrast. Nonetheless, clarity remains intact and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, information density is high, and metaphors are generally clean and coherent with the cosmos/interpretation motif. There is some repetition around “bending,” “filtering,” and “uncertainty,” but it largely reinforces theme rather than feeling like scaffold. No major loops, mixed metaphors, or register slips appear, and syntax stays clear. A touch more pruning of near-duplicate conceptual statements in the final third could tighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and musical, with varied sentence rhythms and strong verbs; images like the “vintage camera…designed for capturing moments yet somehow never quite managing to preserve any” carry multiple layers of meaning. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. There is some density of abstraction in the mentor’s maxims that risks slight overstatement but doesn’t materially blur the closure image. Momentum is preserved despite the lyricism, with little scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight, with good information density—most sentences carry both worldbuilding and emotional charge. Metaphor use is controlled and apt, avoiding purple excess, and syntax varies enough to keep rhythm from flattening. There are a few mildly expository or summarizing lines near the end (“She stayed in Keth-Soral for three years…”) that feel more functional than electric. Overall, line craft is solid and publishable but could gain edge from sharper compression and more surprising phrasal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double-duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“machines that hummed their own secret songs,” “auric ripples that spread… like liquid light”). Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels mixed or gratuitous, and there are no noticeable paraphrase loops or scaffolding. The few slightly abstract phrases are anchored quickly by concrete sensory cues, preserving momentum. Overall, the prose supports and heightens mood and theme without obscuring causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and generally high-density: many sentences carry character, setting, and theme simultaneously (“Whispers passed from ear to ear, growing stronger with each retelling, until a network of voices spread through the labyrinth like mycelium through soil.”). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and figurative language is controlled and coherent with the piece’s atmospheric aims. A few lines veer toward abstract statement (especially in the final paragraph) rather than image-driven dramatization, which slightly blunts momentum and subtlety. Overall, the line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening desirable.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, information-dense, and often do double duty (image + theme). The prose occasionally drifts toward purple or conceptual (“teach darkness the value of stars,” “mathematics of pain”), but these flourishes generally align with the piece’s lyrical mode. There are no major loops or scaffold sentences, and momentum is preserved despite the reflective texture. Slight trimming of abstract phrasing would push this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, often doing double duty with image and idea, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (“memory that refused to stay buried,” “forests of second thoughts”) usually lands cleanly and suits the world. There is some tendency toward conceptual phrasing and repeated structures that could be trimmed for even tighter momentum, especially in the middle explanatory paragraphs. Nonetheless, nothing crucial is obscured, and the final images are sharp rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, rich imagery, and a good balance of action with reflection. Key images (the scrimshaw’s weight, the bioluminescent whale, harbor lights as “old memories”) do multiple jobs at once. There is some tendency toward abstraction and repetition of conceptual pairs (“combative tenderness,” “fierce gentleness,” “freedom…through surrender”) that slightly dulls impact and edges into purple at moments. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no significant loops or muddled metaphors that harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with concrete images (“A curl spirals free like a falling thought”) doing multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined; metaphors are coherent and reinforce the performance/grief/machinery motifs rather than piling up gratuitously. Line-level clarity is excellent, with no notable scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony, and the opening and closing lines both land cleanly. A few thematic expository phrases could be marginally tightened, but they do not materially drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and rich in imagery; phrases like “lantern-moth hush” and “fractured glass scattered across silver water” show high craft. Line-level clarity is maintained despite density, and most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, mood, and character simultaneously). There is some tendency toward stacked metaphor and lush repetition that skirts purple but doesn’t quite tip into muddle or drag momentum. Minor tightening could heighten impact, but current execution is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with clean syntax, varied sentence structures, and a good balance of image and clarity. Metaphors (e.g., “first color a colorblind person might ever truly perceive”) are generally apt and not overstacked, and information density is high without feeling crowded. Some thematic lines verge on explanatory, especially in the final third, softening impact by summarizing what the images already show. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and momentum is well maintained for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and economical, with images like “golden shadows that danced across her schematics” doing multiple jobs at once. Sentences vary in structure and length, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding, repetition, or muddled metaphor. A few lines lean toward abstraction (“texture of connection itself”), but they’re grounded soon after with concrete sensory examples. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication with only light tightening, not major revision.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally polished: sentences vary in length and structure, images are concrete, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to feel purple, and metaphors (“crushed pearls,” “bottom had no floor”) are coherent and apt. There is some mild abstraction and meta-statement, especially around thematic sentences, but few true loops or scaffolding artifacts. Rhythm carries momentum smoothly to the final image, which lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are well-shaped, varied in length, and generally economical despite the lyric register; nearly every line contributes either to atmosphere, character, or thematic build. The recurring images of rain, cards, and tape are handled without obvious redundancy or metaphor muddle, and there are no noticeable scaffold loops or syntactic templates. A few phrases verge on repetition (“inherited mystery,” explanatory restatements of what the cards “do”), but they do not significantly blunt momentum or clarity. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image rather than expository summary.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet largely efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority) without collapsing into muddle. Metaphors like the archive as a “hollow shell of some great creature” or memories as atoms are coherent and sustained rather than mixed. There is some conceptual repetition around purification, capture vs release, and unpredictability, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum at this length. Line-level control is strong enough for immediate publication with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density; most sentences advance both worldbuilding and emotional atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent but not muddled, and metaphors (e.g., grief “still wet with emotion”) generally cohere. There is some lexical repetition (“softly deliberate,” reiterations of role and hope) yet it reads more like motif than scaffold. Momentum is appropriately measured for a lyric piece and never collapses into redundancy or purple sludge.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are rhythmic, information-dense, and multi-tasking (character, setting, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Imagery (mist, glass, stars, tail scales) is sensuous yet controlled; metaphors are coherent and not over-stacked. There are a couple of spots where abstract phrasing could be slightly tightened, but they don’t blunt the closure image or obscure sense. Overall, the prose would be competitive at high-tier venues without substantial line-editing.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are well-shaped, with varied rhythm and strong information density; most lines do at least two jobs (image + emotion, setting + theme). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than showy for their own sake. I see minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. No noticeable grammatical or syntactic artifacts interfere with reading or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatically clean, and often do double duty for atmosphere and interiority, with a consistent metaphorical field. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure meaning, and there are few obvious loops or scaffolding phrases. Some abstractions and near-repetitions (“unused love,” “goodbyes,” “incubate into meaning”) could be pruned or varied for crisper momentum and sharper edges. Overall the prose is polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is polished, grammatically clean, and often beautiful, with strong imagery (“aurora-scented air,” “ice beginning to give way under spring sunlight”). Yet the density of metaphor and the repeated hammering of key phrases (“remembered stardust,” “unwritten calendar,” variants of “the words would not come”) occasionally feel like paraphrase loops rather than fresh progression. This veers into mild purple-prose territory and slightly blurs impact at peak beats, even though clarity and closure remain intact. Trimming a few reiterations would sharpen momentum and let the best images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient: most sentences do double duty in world-building and theme without obvious redundancy. Metaphors are imaginative yet coherent (“light bent wrong,” “voice like wind through the remains of flute”) and there are no noticeable loops or scaffold phrases. Rhythm varies across long, lush sentences and shorter declaratives, giving the piece a musical quality that fits its “lullaby” motif. A slight risk of over-ornamentation exists, but clarity and momentum remain intact through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and multi-function sentences that build world, character, and theme simultaneously. Some figurative density flirts with purple—nearly every line carries a metaphor or abstraction—which can slightly blunt impact and feel repetitive (e.g., repeated “wild frontier of his mind”). Nonetheless, rhythm and syntax are varied, and there are few to no true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Clarity of action and image is maintained through the climax, and the final sentences land musically.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“where sky and sea forgot their boundaries,” “valleys of memory and bridges of intention”) and generally high information density. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; metaphors are coherent and thematically linked, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences. Rhythm varies well across paragraphs, especially around the climax at the ridge crest. The only minor drag is occasional conceptual phrasing that could be pruned for even greater sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is fluent and dense without serious redundancy; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and interiority, with strong rhythm and few if any scaffolding lines. Metaphor use is sustained but generally coherent—music, cold, nerves, and silence interlock into a cohesive image system. There is a mild risk of over-ornamentation in places (“seraphically mundane nature of the discovery”), and a few abstractions in the last paragraph tell what the earlier images already imply. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the final sentence elegantly recharges prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmically controlled, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding + theme + mood). Some images echo or verge on redundancy (multiple “graceful collapse”/drift-style formulations), but there’s minimal paraphrase looping or clutter. Figurative language is dense yet usually coherent and legible, not muddled. The prose could benefit from a occasional sharpening cut to enhance momentum, but it already meets high market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and economical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing scene, deepening character, and reinforcing theme. Imagery (e.g., the reef “like a cemetery of living structures”) is strong but not overstacked, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or template cadences. A couple of phrases flirt with abstraction (“periodically eternal processes”), but they don’t significantly obscure sense or blunt the closure. Overall momentum is maintained smoothly through reflection and present action without line-level clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, sensory details are concrete, and most lines carry multiple jobs (setting, interiority, and theme at once). Repetition of key words (“hum,” “rebellion,” “meaning”) is patterned rather than sloppy, reinforcing the accumulative texture. A few sentences lean toward abstraction or mild redundancy, especially around summarizing the rebellion’s mood, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur the climax. Figurative language is controlled and consistent with the world, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is fluent and often striking, with good syntactic variety and images that do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Occasional abstract phrases (“hybrid futures and evolved consciousness,” “implanted destinies”) are more conceptual than embodied and soften immediacy a bit. There’s mild over-explanation in the final third, but no major loops, mixed metaphors, or rhythm artifacts that impede momentum or clarity. Overall line-level craft is strong and near-ready for high-tier venues with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty (character + theme, setting + mood) without bloat. Metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s concrete vocabulary (glass, soil, weather, light) and avoid purple excess. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic monotony; the piece reads smoothly aloud. Line-level craft supports the closure image, particularly in the final paragraph, without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that mostly hold and reinforce core motifs (watercolors, threads, spirals, breathing walls). The prose leans lush but generally avoids purple excess, and there is little redundancy or scaffolding. A few abstractions and near-metaphorical restatements (“fragmented reality pressed against her thoughts like fog against glass”) risk slight over-ornamentation, but they remain intelligible and tonally appropriate. Momentum is maintained despite lyric density, and the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: imagery is often striking, syntax is mostly clear, and information density is high without much scaffolding. Some sentences verge on purple and there is occasional redundancy around key phrases like “ephemeral patterns in spilled ink” and the time-dilation concept, slightly slowing momentum. Still, figurative language is usually coherent and purposeful, and the final paragraphs land with a clear, charged image. No major artifacts or loops obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    The language is generally polished, with varied sentence rhythm and a few strong images (“each sentence a small apocalypse,” the networks “waking from their long sleep”). Most lines pull double duty for atmosphere and theme without obvious scaffolding or loops. There is some drift toward purple and repetition of conceptual terms (silence, truth, forbidden, dangerous) and a few strained constructions (“cryogenically strengthened hands”) that feel more clever than earned. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum hold, and no line-level artifact significantly obscures the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, high information density, and figurative language that remains coherent and rooted in the story’s imagery (weapons, sand, roses, thread). Sentences tend to do multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, characterization, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The density of metaphor is high but mostly purposeful, not purple for its own sake. There are no major loops or syntactic artifacts, though a touch more variation in sentence length could sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences generally do more than one job, rhythm varies, and figurative language is vivid (“a voice that was also a color, a grief that was also a bell”) without lapsing into muddle. There are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts; exposition is compact and integrated. Occasionally, metaphor density edges toward lush, but it stays legible and doesn’t stall momentum. Overall, this is polished and publication-ready prose with only minor risk of overrichness in places.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is controlled, and most lines carry multiple functions (setting, character, and theme) without padding. Metaphor use is frequent but generally coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (astronomy, archives, ink, orbit), avoiding muddle. There’s minimal redundancy and no serious scaffold or cadence artifacts; the prose moves forward with clarity. A few moments verge on purple or slightly reiterate already established points, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally precise, multi-functional (worldbuilding + emotion + theme), and avoid redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically aligned, with only occasional verge-on-purple phrases that don’t seriously obscure meaning. Momentum holds across the piece despite its reflective bent, in part because each descriptive unit tends to carry a new conceptual or emotional facet. There are no noticeable grammatical errors, loops, or scaffolding artifacts that dull the closing image of her “mapping the stars of redemption.”

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double-duty for character and atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and coherent, with few mixed metaphors or redundant scaffolds. Phrasings like “silence but its opposite, though a silence nonetheless” flirt with over-compression yet remain intelligible and tonally apt. There is minimal padding or looped phrasing, and the closing lines land with clean rhythmic finality.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is generally high: varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) with good information density. There is some drift toward purple or explanatory prose—phrases like “a dialect of faith and geometry that predated the city itself” and repeated restatements of what names do could be trimmed without loss. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not conflicting, and momentum rarely stalls. Minor redundancy and occasional over-explanation keep it shy of the very top tier but still comfortably publishable with light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and dense with image, generally doing multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, mood, character) without bogging momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-true, with only occasional purple notes (“impossible colors,” “suicide of hope”) that flirt with overstatement. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing are varied enough to avoid monotony, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts. The emotional and narrative peaks remain clear despite the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a good balance between description and interiority. Information density is high; many lines do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and theme. There is some repetition and near-purple phrasing (“fractal patterns… fractally precise,” and the reiterated “method of illumination” structure) that could be trimmed for sharpness. Still, clarity and momentum survive, and the final “willowglass hope” image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally strong, dense with information, and often does double duty (worldbuilding + interiority + theme) without losing basic clarity. Images like “photographs made of warmth” are striking, and the line-level rhythm supports the contemplative tone. There is some tendency toward abstraction and slightly purple phrasing in the final third (“a fact that had become legend, a legend that was actually memory”), which risks redundancy more than it deepens cost. Still, no major artifacts or loops obscure the closure image or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, doing simultaneous work for worldbuilding, character, and theme. Metaphors are mostly coherent and well-chosen, and there is little in the way of scaffolding or synonym-churn. Some turns of phrase recur in slightly different guises (“truth unravels,” “scattered like seeds,” “raw possibility”), and abstract nouns cluster in later paragraphs, softening immediacy. Even so, momentum never fully stalls, and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (mood, character, and information) with relatively little scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery is frequently striking (“smelled of mold and regret,” “patient as snow”) and largely coherent rather than mixed. There is some risk of purple-prose saturation, but rhythm and clarity generally hold and momentum does not noticeably stall. No significant loops or structural artifacts undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“stones emerged like knuckles through the mist”) and generally economical sentences that do multiple jobs at once. There is some conceptual repetition around distillation, palimpsests, and promises that flirts with abstraction, but it doesn’t quite sag into full-blown scaffolding. Figurative language is largely coherent and thematically targeted, though the density of metaphors occasionally creates a uniform, slightly over-smooth texture. Line-level momentum is steady, if more contemplative than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, syntax is clear, and figurative language is lush but generally precise and non-redundant. Metaphors like “flatten against the horizon, spreading thin and colorless like a sigh that had lost its fire” and “stacked like plates in a kiln” deepen both atmosphere and theme without tangling sense. There are no real loops or scaffolding artifacts; each sentence tends to carry multiple functions (image, character, and theme) efficiently. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the density of imagery occasionally nudges toward ornamental rather than strictly pressure-serving, though it never seriously impairs clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, mostly tight lines that do more than one job, and a good balance between image and clarity. Phrases like “quivering hush” and “红色叹息” verge on lush but are spaced enough to feel deliberate rather than purple, and the prose maintains momentum through the scene. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; information generally arrives once, in the right place. The final paragraph efficiently braids setting, action, and theme without muddling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and layered images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme. The metaphors (tides as knowledge, ink as marine life, ghosts in her blood) are controlled and coherent, with little redundancy or scaffolding. The prose occasionally brushes purple—especially in the final realizational paragraph—but does not tip into confusion or true overwriting. Momentum holds well for a lyric piece, and the closure image is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for imagery and theme (“a white prayer,” “this small architecture of mud and grass and hope”). Rhythm and paragraphing guide the reader smoothly, and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. That said, the density of figurative language edges toward purple in places, and the stray glitch “分离ations” momentarily disrupts the surface. These are minor, but they prevent the line work from feeling flawlessly honed for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with a few striking phrases (“ethereal grit,” “a crop of chaos being cultivated”). Sentences carry information efficiently without obvious syntactic tics or loops, and paragraphing supports the story’s beats. That said, there is a reliance on abstract nouns (frequencies, resonances, manipulation) and conceptual description where a few more concrete, scene-level images could heighten immediacy. The line-level work is solid and publishable but not yet distinctive enough for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally polished, with varied sentence rhythm and strong sensory images (the organ notes “like a ghost refusing to move on,” distances folding “like origami”). Information density is good; most lines carry both atmosphere and character. There is some mild redundancy and label-based phrasing in the final paragraph that reads more like a synopsis of what we already know. The imagery occasionally approaches purple, but it remains coherent and does not obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, high information density, and striking images like “time had swallowed the fog” and “furrows of light and shadow.” Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent with the story’s tone. There are minor redundancies and slightly purple turns (“anytrace,” the repeated “lance through” metaphor) that don’t materially harm clarity but hint at over-decoration. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, though a light tightening pass would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and images that do multiple jobs (e.g., “palimpsest of suppressed knowledge”). Sentences vary in structure and rhythm, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image. There is occasional abstraction and slightly purple phrasing, but it rarely muddies sense or momentum. Some long explanatory sentences about the great-grandmother’s fate could be tightened to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally sharp, musical, and information-dense, with images often doing double duty for setting and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and grounded; phrases like “ghost photograph learning to breathe” are striking without obscuring sense. There’s minor risk of purple saturation, yet it doesn’t significantly stall momentum or muddle causality. I see no meaningful scaffold loops or syntactic monotony that would hold this back further.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty (character and theme, or setting and mood). The imagery—“faded paint still whispering of adventures,” “dusky harmony of purple and gold”—is vivid yet mostly controlled, and there are few if any outright mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops. There is a mild tendency toward repetition of the territory metaphor and abstract phrasing (“philosophy,” “structure,” “erasure”), which could be tightened or grounded to sharpen momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is strong and publishable with only light trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong images (“paper drink in the flower’s golden residue,” “predictable chaos,” “starlight caught briefly in a lens”) and good rhythmic variety. Information density is high: most sentences do double-duty for setting and theme. There is some repetition of ideas (shared burden, dreams vs. rigid study) and a tendency toward abstraction that slightly blurs impact, but no serious loops or figurative muddle that derail momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is controlled, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Key images (ice dome refracting rainbows, shards dissolving into mist, the first pale shoot) are clean and memorable without overloading metaphor. There are mild tendencies toward conceptual repetition and abstraction in the final third (mirrors/truth/failures restated) and a stray artifact (“his動作”), but they do not seriously harm momentum or closure. Tighter pruning of near-duplicate thematic sentences would lift density further.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with rhythmic sentences and high information density—most lines do double duty for atmosphere and psychology. Metaphors are vivid and largely coherent, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. However, figurative language is nearly continuous (“darkness that was also light,” “membrane…with the weight of futures”) and occasionally drifts toward purple, softening impact rather than sharpening it. Tighter variation in abstraction level would heighten momentum in the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with many lines doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once (e.g., the roots “with an intimacy that felt less violation than communion”). Sentence rhythm and paragraphing support a slow-build, devotional feel appropriate to a ritual scene. The main weakness is a tendency toward abstraction and repeated conceptual phrasing (“holes in her soul,” “architecture of being,” “fierce gentleness”) that occasionally veers near purple or redundant. Still, momentum never stalls and the closure image of the card’s fall and her sister’s inweaving remains clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and multi-functional, with sentences often carrying setting, character, and theme simultaneously. There is mild repetition of certain constructions/phrases (“insulating emotionally with facts,” some echo/silence metaphors) and a touch of abstraction in the final paragraph, but not enough to stall momentum or confuse. Rhythm varies well, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding sentences. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-true.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is graceful and controlled, with strong sensory anchors and varied sentence rhythms that sustain momentum despite a reflective mode. Figurative language (“woven from starlight,” “water finding its level”) is largely apt and not overstacked, and most sentences do double duty for setting, theme, and character. There are a few lines that lean into abstraction or repetition of the central idea of “transition,” but they do not meaningfully obscure clarity or dull the closure. Overall, line-level craft is publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and generally avoid redundancy despite their length. Figurative language (tides, moon, metal, light) is coherent and thematically aligned rather than mixed or overblown. There are a few moments where abstraction and piling of clauses flirt with purple prose, but clarity and rhythm mostly hold. For a top-tier venue, a touch more variation in sentence structure and a hair less exposition-by-assertion would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are generally tight, varied in structure, and do multiple jobs—advancing scene while layering atmosphere or theme. Figurative language is frequent (“small, contained sun waiting to be born”) but coherent and thematically aligned rather than showy for its own sake. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding redundancies, and momentum is maintained despite a reflective mode. A few formulations are a touch on-the-nose, but they do not materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally elegant and efficient, with vivid metaphors that rarely feel strained and good variation in rhythm and paragraphing. Most lines do double-duty—advancing setting and character simultaneously—and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. The prose occasionally edges toward overt exposition of theme but does not bog down momentum or obscure clarity. The closing paragraphs in particular balance texture and directness, landing a clear, memorable final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythmic control and vivid images (“mist pooled…like spilled memories,” “flower made of pure language”). It occasionally flirts with purple or conceptual density, especially where metaphors stack (“Möbius strip of discovery,” “propagation delays…a necessary echo”), but remains mostly clear. Information density is good; each paragraph tends to advance both atmosphere and concept, with little scaffolding or repetition. A touch more restraint in the explanatory sentences could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“light passed through its crystal form like a secret wanting to be told”). Figurative language recurs but stays coherent—ice, light, perforation, plants—without devolving into mixed metaphors or obvious loops. There is minor purple flourish (“smelled of mulberry and impossibility”), yet it fits the lyric mode and doesn’t obscure causality or closure. Line-level craft is just below elite due to occasional excess in modifiers and imagery density.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is polished, largely clear, and maintains momentum despite its descriptive density; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, and character). There is some repetition of abstract phrases (“threshold of stillness,” “spark,” “essence”) and a tendency toward stacked modifiers and semi-ornate metaphors that occasionally verge on purple without adding new nuance. Still, figurative language remains internally coherent and doesn’t obscure causality or the closing image. Tighter pruning of redundant descriptors would elevate the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied in length, and dense with information, and metaphor use is mostly precise and evocative. The prose often does multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, mood, and character interiority—without feeling bloated, and there are few if any true loops or scaffolding lines. A handful of phrases verge on purple or self-conscious (“vineyard hush,” “carpet of endless gray”), and some thematic sentences could be tightened or externalized into image, but they do not seriously obscure meaning or momentum. Overall, the piece reads smoothly and musically, with only mild overwriting in the most reflective sections.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are clean, rhythm varies, and most lines do more than one job, weaving setting, character, and theme efficiently. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts dulling momentum. A few abstractions and diagnostic formulations flatten immediacy slightly, especially around the thematic statements. Overall, the prose would need only light tightening and some concretization to be elite-venue ready.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished, image-rich, and generally economical; most sentences carry more than one function (setting, mood, and theme at once). The figurative language is consistent and legible, avoiding mixed metaphors or density overload given the calm pace. There is little scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraph flow alive. A slight tendency toward grand, poetic phrasing keeps it just shy of the absolute top tier, but it does not obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, syntactically varied, and dense with information doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood plus character). Metaphors (canyon ribs of a fallen god, dust learning her shape) are vivid and mostly coherent, without obvious mixed or strained imagery. There is some repetition of concepts (centuries, layered dust, patterns of birds) that borders on redundant rather than intensifying, but it doesn’t significantly stall momentum in such a short, meditative piece. With slightly sharper pruning of near-duplicate phrases, this could comfortably sit in elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with minimal redundancy, and the metaphors (“lingering luminance,” “brilliant dimness”) are coherent and thematically apt. There is some density of figurative language, but it largely avoids purple excess and maintains clarity. The prose propels smoothly through the central turn; no significant loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors drag momentum. A touch more restraint in the final explanatory sentences could sharpen the closing image further.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, character) and the rhythm varies well across paragraphs. Metaphoric density is high but mostly controlled and internally consistent, with “light left fingerprints” and “distant apologies” feeling fresh rather than overwrought. There is a mild tendency toward abstraction and thematic statement in a few sentences, which slightly blunts momentum in places but does not obscure sense or closure. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or mechanical cadences undercut the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“contracted cosmos,” “stars that had grown close enough to whisper”) and generally good sentence-level rhythm. Information density is high; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, or setting plus interiority). There is a mild purple/abstract streak—conceptual phrases like “space between wavelengths where purpose隐藏 itself” and repeated near-synonymous formulations about mystery and meaning—that could be trimmed for tautness. Still, clarity is never compromised, and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (advancing setting, theme, and emotion) and the figurative language is coherent and well-chosen (“like a promise kept too long,” “like memories refusing to stay buried”). Metaphors are frequent but not contradictory, and repetition tends to be intentional motif rather than scaffolding. There’s minor density that could be trimmed for even sharper momentum, but no real loops, template cadences, or therapy-speak artifacts. The final image is clear and focused, with no figurative muddle obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, fluid, and well-paced, with sentences that carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious bloat. There are a few slightly abstract or repeated formulations (“cosmic imbalance,” “something vast and invisible”) and a modest tendency toward explanation in the final third, but they don’t significantly impede momentum or clarity. Imagery like the narrowing crack and the bell “remember[ing] what it had been” is effective and concrete. Overall line-level craft is solidly above average and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, information) with little redundancy, and the cadence supports the slow, accruing pressure of the piece. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and grounded (“street signs emerging like tombstones,” “a cracked spine of asphalt”), avoiding mixed metaphors. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition in the thematic sentences, yet it never seriously muddies clarity or closure. Overall momentum is preserved despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images like “lightning in snowstorms” and “ice cracking in spring’s first warm embrace,” and most sentences do more than one job (setting, emotion, theme). Rhythm and paragraphing are effective, and there are no major clarity issues or syntactic errors. However, figurative language is quite dense and occasionally repetitive in concept (wonder, transformation, liminal, ancient song), pushing toward purple and slightly dulling impact. A bit more restraint and sharper selection of metaphors would better preserve momentum and emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, well-rhythmed, and information-dense; many sentences carry both atmospheric and character work simultaneously. Repetition (“watcher’s burden,” “could not…could not”) is mostly purposeful, though occasionally on the edge of redundancy. There is a mild tendency toward purple lyricism and abstraction in places, but it seldom obscures clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for serious consideration, though a sharp edit could trim a few slightly over-explanatory or reiterated phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with several memorable images (leaves falling upward, blade cutting the membrane between imitation and authenticity). There is some repetition of key abstractions (“ego death,” “complementary opposites”) and a tendency to lean on conceptual nouns over sensory embodiment, but it doesn’t significantly bog momentum. Figurative language is coherent and not over-stacked, and there are no major mixed metaphors or cadence artifacts. The final lines land clearly and reframe earlier material without stylistic muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, syntactically varied, and image-rich without tipping into incoherence; many sentences pull double duty for mood and character. Metaphors (origami nightmares, storm-born silence, seed as teacher) are apt and consistent, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Some abstract phrasing and thematic explication slightly slow momentum, but they don’t obscure sense or closure. Line-level control is strong enough for a high-end market, though trimming a few explanatory sentences could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmically pleasing, with several strong images (sound “macerating” stillness, dust shaken loose by the engine’s rumble). Yet it leans into repetition and over-explanation, as with defining “macerate” on the page and revisiting the same conceptual ground in similar syntactic shapes. Abstract nouns accumulate (“frequencies,” “emotional barriers,” “core concept”) in ways that slightly blunt immediacy and momentum. The line-level craft is solid but not yet stripped of scaffolding or redundancy at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is musical and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority. Repetitions like “not a prison but a threshold… not a prison but a generous waiting room…” function rhetorically rather than as sloppy loops, but they edge toward over-insistence. Metaphors are generally strong, though they cluster heavily, pushing close to purple in places and occasionally softening impact. Overall momentum survives, yet the density could be trimmed for even greater sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are syntactically varied, concrete images carry thematic weight, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy relative to the density of meaning. Metaphors (frozen bloom, constellation of coals, crozier as withered flower) are coherent and sustained rather than piled on indiscriminately, and the prose mostly avoids purple excess despite its lushness. There are a few echoes (“penny would finally drop,” repeated subtraction/preservation triads) that lightly reinforce rather than bloat, though some abstraction could be trimmed for even sharper momentum. Overall, the prose is a clear asset and does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with varied sentence structure and good information density; nearly every line advances world, character, or atmosphere. Imagery is mostly precise and controlled, and there are no significant loops, muddled metaphors, or clarity issues. Some sentences drift into mild abstraction or scaffolding—“Her equipment was modest by institutional standards,” “something far more profound,” and the explanatory final lines—but they don’t seriously stall momentum. Tightening those summary-like phrases and trusting concrete images more would elevate the prose further.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, information-dense, and often do double duty for atmosphere and character. The metaphors largely land and reinforce the world’s logic (TV losing signal, sideways stars, drained hourglass), and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. There is a mild tendency toward purple abstraction in places (“patterns settled into their new configuration,” “ardence”) that slightly blurs emotional sharpness and edges toward repetition of concept rather than escalation. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved throughout, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, image-rich, and information-dense, often achieving multiple tasks (worldbuilding, character, theme) at once. Metaphors are mostly coherent and fitting, and the piece avoids obvious scaffold, redundancy, or syntactic monotony. The density of figurative language occasionally approaches saturation, but it generally remains legible and purposeful, especially around the “eruption” and closing image. There is little to trim without risking loss of texture.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong images like “the bioluminescent haze” and “the weight of water” that do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus character plus tone). There is minor redundancy and some abstract phrasing around the aliens’ knowledge that could be tightened, but it does not significantly drag momentum. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent, and the diction is precise without tipping into gratuitous ornament—there’s little synonym churn or line-level padding. A few lines verge on purple or explanatory (“collective holding of breath, as if the building itself waited for her to succeed”; the explicit heroism reflection), but they do not muddle causality or dull the closing image. Line-level craft is above-average for elite-market submissions, with only minor tightening needed around thematic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally tight: strong verbs, concrete images, and minimal scaffolding, with multi-function sentences that carry both atmosphere and information. Occasional abstractions (“consciousness learning to perceive”) and repeated phrasing (“standing by the unremembered”) verge on thematic telling but don’t significantly drag momentum. There are no obvious synonym loops, cadence templates, or figurative muddles that obscure sense, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. Overall, the prose supports the concept rather than competing with it.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and efficient sentences that often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Metaphors like the observatory emerging “like a bone pushed up from deep earth” and snow as “soft white equations” are vivid but not overstacked to the point of purple prose. There’s little redundancy or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensuous, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“dust of forgotten pronunciations” is a standout). Metaphorical patterning around bone, throat, and echo is coherent rather than muddled, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The prose borders on lush in every paragraph, which risks monotony and faint purple over time, but it remains mostly precise and never actively obscures sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“water to trickle upward toward the ceiling,” “frostbitten hope”) and good rhythmic variation. Some lines veer toward purple or conceptual stacking (“a being that existed between the frequencies of sound and silence”; “frostbitten hope that perhaps some mysteries were meant to remain unsolved”) without always adding new pressure or clarity. There are light redundancies in stating the thematic frame near the end, but no major loops or syntactic artifacts that impede reading. Line-level craft is above the bar for many markets, though a ruthless trim of abstractions would tighten it for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are generally precise, and most lines do double duty in building mood and advancing the situation. Figurative language is frequent but usually disciplined; metaphors tend to be coherent and anchored in the world’s logic. There are a few patches of near-overwriting or conceptual redundancy (e.g., repeating the “gap between knowing and understanding,” and somewhat on-the-nose phrases about beauty and efficiency), but they don’t stall momentum or obscure sense. Overall, the prose passes the read-aloud test with good propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-rich without devolving into confusion; nearly every sentence carries either worldbuilding, character, or thematic weight. Metaphors like the trapped thunderstorm are vivid and coherent, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or repetition. Some lines flirt with purple or slogan-like abstraction (“healing required medicine and metaphor in equal measure”), but these are occasional rather than pervasive and don’t obscure sense. Overall momentum is steady and clear, with a strong read-aloud quality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythmic control in its long, flowing sentences, and most lines do double duty in atmosphere and characterization. Repetition of motifs (“silence,” “hush,” “gleam”) feels intentional and pattern-building rather than purely redundant, though a demanding editor might trim a few abstractions and tighten some clauses. Figurative language is generally coherent and apt, and there are no serious clarity issues or scaffolding artifacts. The main constraint on a higher score is a slight tendency toward overluxuriance—occasionally telling us what images already imply—which modestly softens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood, and the figurative language around geometry and memory is coherent. Repetition of phrases like “observed solitude” reads as motif rather than scaffolding, and there is little redundancy or synonym churn. Rhythm varies nicely between longer meditative lines and tighter, focused moments during the ritual. The piece is near-ready at line level, needing only minor tightening if placed in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are elegant and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character without sliding into muddle. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (light, tides, whispers, marginalia), with little redundancy or filler scaffolding. Rhythm varies well across longer, sinuous lines and shorter anchoring clauses, sustaining momentum in a reflective mode. A tiny trimming of repeated constructions like “she learned that” / “she understood then that” could sharpen an already polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and high information density—most sentences do double duty in atmosphere and character. There is some repetition and near-purple diction (“across the hush of cosmic possibility,” “improbable longing”) that verge on over-ornate but remain intelligible and thematically consistent. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled; metaphors are coherent and rarely mixed. Momentum is steady despite a reflective mode, and there are few, if any, true scaffold or paraphrase loops dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; images like “masts protruding from the murk like splintered fingers” and memories “scattered like seeds across the marsh” do multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, and sentences avoid obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few repeated phrases (“chronically curious”) nudge toward thematic hammering, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images like dust motes as “slow planets” and the shadow as a specimen pressed in glass; sentences do multiple jobs in setting, character, and theme. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are no major clarity issues or scaffolding loops. At times, the density of figurative language and abstract phrasing (“spatial poetry,” “architecture of the past”) skirts purple and could be trimmed for even sharper impact, and the mid-sentence switch to Chinese characters is a small jolt in register. Overall, though, line-level craft supports momentum and mood rather than obscuring them.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, well-structured, and often do double duty with atmosphere and theme. There is some piling up of figurative language and elevated diction (“liquid silver,” “color of wonder,” “weave new threads of magic”) that edges toward purple in aggregate, but it remains legible. Redundancies are mild rather than pervasive, and the rhythm is varied enough to avoid mechanical cadence. Tightening a few metaphors and trimming repeated conceptual phrasing would push this closer to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, few if any redundancies, and images that often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Phrases like “silence pressing against her ears like water” and knots sighing as they yield are vivid without obscuring action. There is a high density of figurative language and abstractions (“full quiet,” “vessels, containers for spirits”) that occasionally approach lushness, but they remain coherent and don’t blur causality. A slightly leaner line in one or two spots could heighten impact, which is why this sits just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and fluent, with good rhythmic variation and a clear preference for image-rich sentences. That said, it tends toward overwriting and conceptual redundancy, often restating similar ideas about thresholds and silence in slightly different terms, especially in the opening and closing graf. Figurative language is generally apt but dense enough at times to slow momentum and blur edge. Line-level craft is solid but would benefit from pruning and sharpening to reach top-tier concision.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong information density—most lines do double duty in advancing setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and largely clean; metaphors like “wreckage had its own architecture, its own logic” feel apt rather than strained. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax stays clear even when the concepts turn abstract. A few lines verge on thesis statement, but they don’t significantly bog momentum or blur images.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush but mostly controlled; sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character interiority) without bogging down. There are minor redundancies and some slightly overpacked phrases (e.g., “sequences… in sequences”) but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Figurative language is largely coherent and thematically apt, blending mechanical and organic imagery in ways that support the central conceit rather than distract from it. Line-level rhythm supports the accumulative, lyrical build toward the final harmony image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is elegant and mostly efficient, with concrete images doing multiple jobs (light, metal, frost, clouds) and minimal scaffolding. There is some tendency toward long, clause-heavy sentences and a whiff of purple in places, particularly the very long final sentence, but clarity remains intact. Redundancy and template cadence are largely avoided; each paragraph adds new emotional or sensory information. With slight tightening—especially of the closer—it would comfortably reach top-market polish.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“held breath waiting to become speech,” “dusty starlight particles”). There is some risk of over-dense figurative language, especially where multiple metaphors stack in proximity, but clarity remains intact and the closure image is sharp. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal; nearly every line contributes to mood or thematic build. The main limitation, from an elite-editor lens, is that the uniform lushness slightly flattens dynamic range and could benefit from a few plainer, cutting beats for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-by-line craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language (“fractally precise architecture,” “tree’s slow breathing”) is controlled and thematically apt, with minimal purple excess. A few abstractions around “knowledge” and “patterns” could be grounded more in concrete sensation, but they do not obscure sense or drag momentum. The final image is clean and charged, not dulled by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, character, and motion) without feeling padded. Figurative language is controlled and mostly apt, with no mixed metaphors or purple stacks that obscure meaning. Information flows logically and clearly, and paragraphing supports both momentum and atmosphere. To reach an elite plateau, the diction and imagery would need a slightly higher density of surprising, precise turns that feel uniquely this story’s rather than broadly “good genre” prose.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density and few, if any, redundant scaffolding sentences. Imagery is rich—dust motes as frozen thoughts, gears dissolving like sugar in rainwater—and usually coherent within the established aesthetic. There is some metaphor stacking (driftwood, frost, light) that slightly risks saturation, but it doesn’t obscure sense or closure. Syntax varies enough to maintain momentum, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: syntax varies, images are clear, and most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotional shading). There is some density of modifiers and long sentences, but they are generally controlled and intelligible rather than purple or muddled. I see minimal repetition or scaffold; momentum holds despite the reflective tilt. A bit more pruning of abstract phrases (“something ineffable,” “frantic scrabble for security”) in favor of further concretes could sharpen impact, but nothing here seriously drags or obscures.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, specific, and generally do multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and emotion together). Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and legible, avoiding true muddle. There is mild risk of purple density and a few near-redundancies in describing gears, springs, and lullabies, but they don’t seriously drag momentum or obscure sense. The closing image is clear and cleanly delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double duty (worldbuilding plus psychology, e.g., the orchard “like a wound that refused to heal”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and metaphors stay coherent with the established imagery of wounds, machinery, and geometry. There’s minimal scaffold or repetition; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. A slightly high metaphor density in places is the only thing keeping this from the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong images (“spirals within spirals,” “paper-thin, its amber casing empty”) and a rhythm that supports the reflective mood without bogging down. Sentences often do double duty, advancing both theme and emotion, and there’s little true scaffolding or repetition. A few abstract, summary-like lines about grief and atonement soften the impact of otherwise sharp concrete detail. While the language is polished and occasionally beautiful, it stops just short of the kind of startling precision and concision that would qualify as top-tier line work.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images like “dust motes drift through bars of bottled moonlight” and the orchard of glass branches are precise and evocative, and most sentences do more than one job. There are minor issues—a typographical glitch (“stillForming”), occasional near-repetitions of the core idea, and moments where abstraction stacks (“visible language of stories not yet spoken”) without adding new nuance. The prose verges on purple in places but remains legible and purposeful, so momentum is slowed slightly but not stalled.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and dense without tipping into opacity, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme at once). Metaphors are extended but coherent within the piece’s logic (palimpsest, tide pools, emotional flavors), and there are no notable loops or scaffolding lines that could be cut without loss. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and the final image is clean and charged rather than overexplained. A few phrases (“emotionally contagious through touch,” “emotional residue”) nudge toward abstraction, but they don’t significantly blunt the line-level effect.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, theme, and character. Metaphors of clocks, weights, and silos are coherent and recur purposefully rather than as decorative flourishes. At times the language edges toward purple or abstraction, yet it stops short of obscuring sense or momentum, and there are few if any paraphrase loops. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive markets, though a very demanding editor might trim a handful of modifiers for even greater sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong verbs and carefully chosen metaphors; sentences do multiple jobs without evident scaffolding or synonym loops. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative lines and more direct statements, and the copy is clean. A few phrases stretch toward abstraction or mild purple (“synaptic pathways reorganize themselves instinctively”) but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. The final paragraph in particular lands with clarity and economy, avoiding line-level clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, characterization) and the rhythm generally propels rather than stalls. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled and legible, and phrases like “fell upward into the mist” or “born into air” are striking without being muddled. A couple of choices—such as “sprolved into bloom” and slight repetition of “clandestinely luminous”—introduce a hint of self-consciousness or purple edging. Even so, clarity remains intact, and the piece’s overall information density and cadence are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs, and multi-tasking images that build setting and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, with minimal redundancy or scaffold. The prose maintains momentum despite its contemplative mode, rarely circling the same idea, and the final sentences land clearly. It stops short of absolute brilliance only because the density of metaphor occasionally risks feeling ornamental rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing character and theme while sustaining atmosphere. Metaphors around magnetism, eclipse, and breath are mostly coherent and reinforce each other. There is some repetition and conceptual redundancy (“beauty in the difficult,” “covenant,” “precision”) and a mild tendency to explain what the images already imply, which slightly slows momentum. Still, rhythm, clarity, and copy-level correctness are strong, with no major artifacts that mar closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing multiple jobs per line (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Metaphors like “snow falling on a dead television screen” are vivid and apt, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. At times, the language edges into purple—stacked abstractions about silence and empathy in close succession—which risks softening urgency and clarity. Nonetheless, it remains legible and propulsive enough that line-level craft rarely impedes momentum or sense.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, efficient paragraphs, and multi-purpose lines that advance setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Sensory and figurative language is dense but generally coherent and purposeful, especially around smell and transformation. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences; the prose maintains momentum despite being reflective. A few constructions (“turning of the tide's thought”) flirt with abstraction, but they don’t obscure meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, information-dense, and often do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Figurative language is rich but not so stacked as to become purple or obscure action, and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Key beats—like the accelerated blossoming—are rendered crisply and cinematically. A few phrases tread close to familiar genre diction (“secrets worth the risk,” “ordinary miracle”), slightly dulling the edge in an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors (labyrinth, fingerprints, hidden mathematics) align with the investigative frame. A few abstractions (“singular convergence,” “cultivation of foresight in action”) trend conceptual, but they remain legible and thematically relevant rather than muddy. Rhythm and paragraphing support a steady, investigative momentum appropriate to the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but mostly precise: metaphors (“frozen lung,” “white-gold filament”) are vivid and coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, theme). Figurative density is high, yet it remains legible and rarely lapses into mixed or self-contradictory images; there’s minimal paraphrase-looping or scaffold. Momentum is maintained despite lyricism, and the final paragraphs land on strong, charged images rather than summary. It’s near-publishable line work with only a slight risk of purple excess in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong, with good rhythm, variation, and dense yet mostly purposeful imagery; the piece reads aloud smoothly. Some metaphoric stacking and adjective weight (“avalanchingly quiet,” “echo-heavy passages,” “tiny suspended worlds waiting to be born”) verge on purple and could be pared without loss. There are mild redundancies in how guilt and failure are described, but not enough to stall momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and deliberate, just a touch over-decorated for peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines do double duty as worldbuilding and emotional framing. Metaphors are mostly apt and resonant, and outright redundancy is rare. There is a mild tendency toward conceptual stacking (“a condition of perception, a symptom of the world becoming itself…”) that risks blur and could be tightened without loss. Still, clarity is maintained, and the final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: syntax varies, imagery is generally precise, and there are few if any true redundancies or scaffolding lines. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to feel purple, and most metaphors (keys, seeds, aurora as mythic bleed) align cleanly. A few phrases (“the wonder kept growing,” “something steady and certain”) lean generic, softening impact slightly. Nonetheless, momentum and clarity are well maintained, and the final paragraphs land with a clean, legible image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, cleanly constructed, and information-dense, with most lines doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful—“crystallized whispers,” “emotional archaeology,” and similar phrases sharpen rather than blur. There are no notable loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors dulling the closure image, and the final paragraph lands with clarity and cadence. A few abstractions (“truth that scientists refused to believe”) slightly thin the immediacy but do not materially harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, information is dense, and the prose carries mood and meaning simultaneously. The figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and motivated by the piece’s tapestry/weaving conceit. There is mild risk of purple abstraction in stacked phrases like “geometry and grief” and “time’s unraveling tapestry,” and a few near-repetitions could be tightened, but clarity is never lost. The closure image reads cleanly and without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language is vivid yet controlled (“weightless as captured moonlight,” “roots that had never known sunlight”) without slipping into muddle or cliché. A few abstractions and near-platitudes appear in the reflective passages, but they don’t significantly stall momentum or cloud the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythm, clean syntax, and multi-tasking sentences that build world, mood, and character at once. Phrases like “the membrane between worlds,” “murmur of half-remembered dreams,” and “particular quality of longing” are evocative without tipping into pure purple. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“weight,” “membrane,” “murmur of half-remembered dreams”) and abstract-noun densities in the final third that slightly blunt impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and no major scaffolding or loops appear.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is tight, rhythmically controlled, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (setting, character, tone) without padding. Figurative language is present but measured and coherent, with no mixed metaphors or purple excess that obscure sense. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or copy-edit issues, and the final image is clean and strong. At elite level one might want an occasional sharper, more idiosyncratic turn of phrase, but nothing here drags momentum or muddies clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, metaphor usage is controlled and mostly coherent, and there is good information density in each paragraph. Repetition (of laughter, light, reflection) feels patterned rather than like synonym churn or scaffolding. A few lines flirt with purple (“making tomorrow from the stuff of yesterday”), but they stay legible and in-character for this elevated mode. There are no significant loops or clarity issues, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and metaphors around light and color are mostly precise and controlled. The piece maintains good information density; description often does double duty for theme and character. There is some mild redundancy and a tendency toward abstract restatement in the thematic sections, but it does not significantly bog momentum or obscure closure. Figurative language is frequent yet not so dense or mixed as to feel purple or confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled: images like “weather had carved rivers into the mortar” and “each grief a grain of sand in an hourglass that stretches back to the first wall raised against confusion” are precise and evocative. Sentences carry multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, theme, and mood—without obvious redundancy or synonym-looping. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, maintaining clear metaphoric lines tied to stone, maps, sea, and measurement instead of mixing vehicles haphazardly. Momentum is appropriately measured for a lyric piece, with no line-level artifacts that blur cause/effect or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and imagistic, with many sentences doing double-duty for worldbuilding and emotion (e.g., mica windows diffusing ghostly light as “something almost resembling warmth”). Line-level clarity is generally good, and the closing cascade of shards and light is vivid and legible. However, figurative density is very high—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or abstraction—which verges on purple and occasionally blurs precision and momentum. Trimming a few redundant intensifiers and generalized abstractions would sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: the opening image of the silent bell and dust motes, the Russian doll paradox, and “archives of a society that collected wisdom the way other people collected stamps” are sharp and effective. Prose maintains momentum despite a reflective mode, with most lines doing double duty (image plus theme or character). There is mild purple-leaning and repetition in metaphors of stillness and paradox that could be trimmed for maximum impact. No serious artifacts or loops interfere with clarity or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, precise, and carry multiple functions (setting, character, and theme) without obvious padding. Repetition of key phrases works as motif rather than artifact, and imagery (“time had forgotten to claim it,” “uncloaking” the beams) is generally fresh and legible. There’s mild risk of tonal sameness and occasional near-abstract phrasing, but clarity and momentum never meaningfully suffer. For top-tier venues, a touch more syntactic and rhythmic variation at peaks could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean yet image-rich, with clear sequencing and minimal redundancy, and key phrases like “quartz hush” and “frozen shelves” carry weight. Figurative language is frequent but consistent in register and domain (frost, crystal, light), so it supports rather than muddles clarity. There is slight risk of purple density and thematic restatement in the final paragraphs, where abstractions (“realm of human understanding,” “true purpose of her calling”) are stacked instead of letting images fully carry them. Still, momentum and clarity remain intact, with no major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language (“stretched thin like the tarpaulins…”, “lodged…like a splinter”) is apt and not overstacked, and there are few if any confusing metaphors. There is some density of description early on, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or obscure causality. A touch more syntactic variation in a couple of long, clause-heavy sentences could sharpen propulsion around the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, imagery is vivid, and most metaphors (“memory made visible,” taste of copper and distance) are both precise and legible. Prose density is high yet generally controlled; description advances mood and theme rather than stalling. There’s some risk of purple prose, but repetition and mixed metaphors are avoided and momentum is maintained across the scene. The final image is clear and charged, not drowned in ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, layered images that usually pull double duty (emotional and sensory), and minimal true scaffolding or synonym loops. Some metaphoric density veers close to purple (“womb of crystallized light,” “prismatic tears”) but retains coherence and does not obscure sense. Information density is high, with backstory and present action braided efficiently. A touch more restraint in the final paragraph could sharpen impact by letting key images (charcoal fingers, blank canvas) stand uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and character stance. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent; metaphors like “dust that had forgotten how to be soil” and the room as a garden feel earned rather than decorative. There is little sign of paraphrase loops or scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A few phrases tread close to familiar lyric territory (“something new was beginning to grow”), but they don’t significantly blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied in length, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional tone, and the rhythm matches the contemplative pacing. Figurative language around sound and material memory is mostly coherent and fresh, avoiding mixed metaphors. There is some density of abstraction and repeated explanatory framing (“This was the symphonic principle…”) that could be trimmed without loss, but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or dull the closure. Overall, the prose is near-publishable in a high-tier venue with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich but largely controlled: metaphors (“magnetic north wandering somewhere past Saturn’s memory,” “screaming between stations”) are vivid and coherent with the world’s logic. Sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with minimal scaffolding or repetition. A few moments push toward purple or abstraction in the final paragraph, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum through a mostly interior, lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong image-making and efficient transitions; most sentences do multiple jobs (setting mood, revealing character, and advancing situation). Rhythm varies nicely, and there are few if any clunky constructions or true redundancies. Some lines veer toward purple or abstract (“healing required witness,” “stories needed to be heard before they could be released”), and thematic exposition occasionally substitutes for dramatized moments, but not to the point of obscuring clarity or dulling the closure image. Line-level control is solidly publication-ready with only modest tightening needed for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is generally strong: vivid images, tight sentence-level rhythm, and good information density with little true scaffolding. There is some metaphor stacking and conceptual repetition (“encrypted weaknesses had become her strength,” “voice lived now in every movement”) that edges toward purple and could be pruned for even greater impact. The stray language artifacts (“方向盘,” “神经系统”) read as glitches rather than intentional multilingualism and briefly break immersion and polish. Overall momentum and clarity stay intact, but these small artifacts and moments of overwrite keep it short of top-tier line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures and a high density of meaningful images; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and internally consistent; images of salt, gravity, light, and maps recur with intention. There are a few near-overwritten spots where abstractions stack (e.g., “language of the dead,” “map of the soul”) that risk feeling slightly generic compared to the sharper physical images. Overall momentum holds well for a lyric piece, and clarity at key beats (descent, gravity pockets, final touch) remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally dense with information, doing double duty for scene, character, and theme, and the sonic patterning supports the meditative tone. Metaphoric language is frequent but internally coherent—water, sound, and folding recur as a controlled cluster rather than a muddled mix. There is mild overwriting in phrases like “tranquil blaze” and some near-redundant restatements of the prophecy/silence premise, but these function more as motif reinforcement than dead weight. Mechanics are clean and the final image lands clearly without figurative fog.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and metaphors that are both on-theme and mostly unstrained (e.g., stars as “corrections,” doors as lives opening/closing). Sentence rhythm and paragraphing maintain momentum despite a reflective mode, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few lines edge toward metaphorical saturation, but the pattern is taught early and sustained, so it reads as deliberate texture rather than purple excess. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready with only minimal tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences have varied structure, carry multiple functions (image, mood, information) without bloat, and rarely repeat ideas. Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked, and metaphors (“as if the sky itself were bleeding into the earth”) feel coherent with the story’s tone. Occasional expository phrases about Elena’s reputation and research compress efficiently rather than bogging momentum. There are no evident loops, muddled images, or rhythm-killing scaffolds, placing this comfortably in a strong publishable band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, metaphor chains are coherent, and most lines carry multiple functions (world, theme, character) without padding. A few motifs are repeated almost verbatim (“stalactites dripped their patient measure/count,” “pearl twilight,” “wisely enduring”), but they read as intentional patterning rather than accidental loops. The prose skirts purple at times, yet clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and generally high-density, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional shading. Phrases like “bridge between the speaking world and the silences that held it together” are evocative without derailing clarity. There is some tendency toward stacked modifiers and repeated conceptual language (“secret song,” “whisper,” “echo”) that tip toward purple but never fully swamp momentum or sense. No significant loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles interfere with the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally polished and economical for a lyric mode: metaphors (glacier as vault, wreck as cathedral ribs, memories as snow) are controlled and coherent. Sentences often do double duty, conveying world, mood, and premise without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There’s a mild density of figurative language, but it’s pattern-consistent rather than purple to the point of obscurity, and momentum is preserved in a reflective register. No significant loops or artifacts blunt the closure image of the melting globe yielding its last secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“The stone beneath her palms still held the memory of the storm, cool and patient”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent with the net/pattern motif; it rarely feels like decorative churn. A few phrases (“scintillatingly somber”) flirt with purple, yet they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. There’s little noticeable looping or scaffold, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm alive.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences often carry world-building, character, and theme simultaneously (“the way comfortable lies clustered around uncomfortable truths like storm clouds around a stillpoint of calm”). Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with no major mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. There is some conceptual reiteration (myth vs. truth framing) in the latter third that could be pared slightly, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. Line-level craft is already publication-ready, if not quite at the level of startling compression or risk that would push into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length, imagery is often striking, and most lines pull double duty (atmosphere + character or world-building). A few moments flirt with purple prose or metaphor pile-up (“like dying wasps,” “like a flower made of static and lightning”) that risk feeling ornamental rather than precise, but they do not obscure sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum holds despite reflective passages. Tightening a handful of metaphors and trimming a bit of abstraction would move this toward genuinely elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character—and the rhythms vary enough to keep the piece from feeling monotonous. Images such as jars clinking “like wind chimes” and the music that “carried the weight of every evening someone had turned the crank” are evocative without devolving into incoherent metaphor chains. There is some drift toward abstraction and repetition (“true poetry of the world,” “human ache,” “redemption,” “connection as currency”) that edges close to purple in places but doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or undercut the closure image. Tightening a few summary lines and trimming thematic abstraction would lift this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and stakes. Occasional abstractions and near-repetitions (“logical assessment…far more visceral,” “marriage of logic and feeling”) nibble at concision but do not seriously stall momentum. Figurative language is controlled and internally consistent; no mixed metaphors or heavy purple patches. The final paragraph resolves with a clear, charged image rather than explanatory scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful, with layered images that do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme). There are minor issues—typos (“andshifted,” “unyokeing”), some purple-leaning metaphor stacks, and a tendency to circle the same abstractions (“energies,” “revolution,” “patience”) without new inflection. Still, sentence rhythm generally propels rather than stalls, and most figurative language is coherent and apt. Tightening redundancy and cleaning copy would lift this toward elite readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, readable, and mostly economical, with a good balance of concrete detail and interior commentary. There are some familiar phrases (“heart hammering against her ribs,” “with vengeance”) and a few explanatory lines that could be sharpened or compressed, but little true redundancy or scaffolding. Sentences vary in length and rhythm enough to sustain momentum through a largely contemplative scene. Figurative language is light and coherent, avoiding purple excess or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, mostly economical, and often striking in its imagery (“motes of dust…like small searching souls,” “every confession landed like a dropped coin into some vast and patient ledger”). Sentences carry multiple loads—setting, emotion, and theme—without much redundancy or scaffolding. There is a mild tendency toward rich figurative density, but it stops short of purple; metaphors are coherent and voice-justified. A bit more variation in rhythm and a few sharper, plainer beats around key turns would heighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with metaphors that largely cohere and advance both worldbuilding and emotion (“sharp in the way questions are sharp,” “cathedral of motion”). Sentences usually do multiple jobs at once—world, theme, and character—and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative density is high, but it stops short of obscuring clarity; the narrative remains legible and propelled. Minor purple-leaning moments exist, yet they don’t materially dull the closure image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with good information density and purposeful repetition (“digital ghost images,” “echo of forgotten songs”) that functions as motif rather than clutter. Sentences vary in length and structure, maintaining momentum while accommodating some lyrical phrasing. The heaviest informational block—the board’s decision about Prometheus and the commercial implications—reads slightly more like a compact exposition drop than fully dramatized discovery but doesn’t significantly drag. There are no major artifacts, mixed metaphors, or syntactic glitches to undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: images like “shadows that laced through her work like veins through marble” and ice floes “like sleeping giants” are vivid and precise, and most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and the prose maintains clarity even in its densest moments. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the cadence of longer, flowing sentences suits the reflective mode. It verges on lush but stops short of genuine purple; a touch more spareness around key turns could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant and economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“endings were honest there” is both thematic and situational). Metaphors (ice as “conversations between worlds,” endings as a “folding of patience”) are coherent and not over-stacked, and there’s little in the way of redundancy or scaffolding. Prose flows clearly from sentence to sentence, with no syntactic confusion or obvious loops. A few abstractions could be slightly pruned for tautness, but they don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and precise, with strong images (“sun bled amber…burnt honey and copper rust”) and good sentence-level rhythm. There is occasional purple tendency and abstraction stacking in the thematic lines, plus a couple of copy issues (“rediscover-ed,” stray non-English characters) that would need correction for top-tier publication. Some metaphors and phrases could be trimmed for concision without losing power. Overall line craft is strong but not yet immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling monotonous despite its lyric density. Figurative language is rich but mostly disciplined and coherent with the established metaphors of lines, murmurs, and thresholds; there’s little sense of synonym churn or decorative padding. Information flows clearly, and the final image of her adjusting the mask and setting out again lands cleanly. At times the prose flirts with purple, but it never quite tips into overwriting that obscures sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose frequently achieves striking images and layered sentences, and many lines efficiently do double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, there is a tendency toward purple accumulation—metaphors and abstractions stack where a cleaner line would suffice—and some phrasing/typo artifacts (“soft梯形,” “She press,” “to.root”) break the surface. A few concepts are reiterated in slightly different language, softening momentum. Overall, the line work is good but not at the flawless, generation-ready level this market demands.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant and dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“Everything…grows toward the light and away from it in the same breath”). Figurative language is mostly coherent and apt, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Some metaphors and abstractions cluster (“pattern of growth,” “testimony,” “completion”) in ways that risk slight overstatement, but they don’t obscure clarity. Rhythm and syntax support the contemplative pace without bogging it down.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is rich and imagistic without tipping into incoherence; metaphors (magnetic ribbons like unread prayers, the sound of cartilage becoming bone) feel precise and thematically aligned. Information density is high—most sentences do more than one job—yet scene momentum remains intact. A few lines verge on abstraction, but they remain anchored enough in sensory or bodily reference to avoid purple fog. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or rhythm artifacts that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally excellent: varied structures, strong verbs, and rich images that often do double duty for mood and theme. Phrases like “luminous ache,” “radical gentleness,” and the leaf’s descent are memorable and precise. At times, the prose edges into purple and abstract repetition around the core concepts (time, stillness, ephemerality), which slightly blurs momentum and could be tightened without thematic loss. There are no major clarity issues or scaffolding loops, but line-level restraint would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence-level craft is polished, with strong sensory images and generally efficient lines that do more than one job. The broken record, light, and “pulsing stillness” metaphors are coherent and recur with intention. There is a slight tendency toward stacked abstractions and decorative metaphors in a few places, which risks purple prose but doesn’t obscure meaning or stall momentum. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or mechanical cadences intrude on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, precise, and readable, with some strong images (“pulsed with captured starlight,” “rose like breath returning to a sleeping body”). Information density is good: most sentences carry worldbuilding plus mood or character. However, there is some conceptual redundancy and mild purple-leaning abstraction—especially in repeated invocations of “sealed awakenings,” “curvature,” and “relearned everything she thought she knew”—that tell a bit more than necessary. These don’t seriously obscure clarity or closure, but they slightly slow momentum and keep the line-level from feeling razor-honed for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and multi-functional, advancing character, theme, and atmosphere together. Figurative language (“bone setting for the soul,” “framed like an unwanted returned letter”) is generally precise and not overstacked. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the prose maintains momentum despite reflective density. A few abstractions could be trimmed for even sharper impact, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with sentences that carry multiple functions (world-building, emotion, theme) and a rhythm that suits the quiet, reflective mode. Some phrases veer toward purple or redundant (“filtered light that filtered,” stacking of modifiers like “soft, sustainable luminescence”), and there is occasional conceptual repetition around light and stillness that could be tightened. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and most figurative language feels coherent and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple burdens (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding, and rhythm alternates between long, sinuous lines and shorter emphatic ones. Imagery is mostly precise and coherent—the moss and water motifs are well-handled and not over-mixed. A slight tendency toward abstraction (“the thrum of nothing and everything,” “architecture of our family”) and repeated motif-phrases keeps it just shy of the very top tier but doesn’t materially harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, largely free of redundancy, and often carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is consistent and seldom confused, with the spiral motif and mist imagery paying off cleanly in the ending. There is a slight tendency toward purple repetition of key phrases (“feral nexus,” “inside the whisper of closing pages”) and abstract nouns, which could be trimmed for even tauter momentum. Nothing here significantly obscures causality or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly well-shaped, and description carries both atmosphere and information. There is some stacking of imagery and modifiers (“painting the mist in shades of amber and pearl,” “spun sunlight”) that edges toward lush, but it remains coherent and purposeful rather than purple. Redundancy and scaffold are minimal; most lines do more than one job. Rhythm supports the quiet, accumulative pressure of the ritual without bogging down.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and largely purposeful figurative language that builds a unified atmosphere. Some metaphors stack (“cold pressed in like a living thing,” “world held its breath,” “patience of frost”) in ways that verge on purple and slightly dampen momentum, but they remain legible and thematically aligned. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or clarity breaks, and the final image is clean. The prose is strong but could benefit from a touch more spareness in places to hit truly elite sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, character, or theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Imagery around reflection, echoes, and mechanism is coherent and sustained, and the line-level clarity remains high despite the conceptual register. There is some tendency toward abstraction and repeated conceptual terminology near the end, which slightly softens momentum and could be tightened for maximal impact. Nonetheless, there are no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but generally precise; metaphors are extended rather than mixed, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interior state at once). There is some risk of over-density—several sentences stack figurative language (“shingled hush…like the scales of some great sleeping thing”)—yet clarity and momentum are maintained for this contemplative mode. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor trims needed if a magazine wanted a slightly leaner texture.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, layered metaphors (cage vs. embrace, crystallized time, rust-hued peace) and mostly clean rhythm. There is some risk of purple prose and repetition around key terms like “crystallized” and generalized abstractions (“haunting practicality of grief”), but clarity is never compromised. Almost every sentence pulls double duty for mood and character, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. A slight trim of overtly thematic lines could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: images usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion) without collapsing into noise. Repetition motifs (camera wheel, light without sun, carousel silence) are pattern-taught and used strategically at the end. A few lines flirt with abstraction or conceptual phrasing (“experience of standing at the edge and finding the courage absent”), but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Overall, sentence rhythm and variation keep the piece moving despite its reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, syntactically varied, and generally efficient, with strong images (“sediment swirl away in dark ribbons”) doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and exposition is compact. Metaphoric density remains controlled; only occasionally does the language drift toward the abstract (“maze of intentions”) without adding new pressure. It’s polished and publication-ready at many venues, even if not yet dazzling at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density; images like “this small universe of brass and steel” and “the glacial hush of the sanctuary settle around me like a second skin” are memorable. There’s some purple-leaning density—multiple metaphors stacked in close succession and a near-constant figurative register—but clarity remains intact and redundancy is minimal. Sentences vary in length and structure, sustaining momentum through what is essentially a meditative scene. A bit more austerity in the highest-pressure moments (e.g., the actual winding) would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically controlled, and dense with meaning, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful—canal as “black glass,” warehouses’ past as a “fashionable costume,” etc.—without piling into muddle. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and exposition is efficiently folded into the present moment. The main limitation is that the consistently lush register flirts with overrichness in places, but it never significantly obscures clarity or dulls the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and high-density, with many sentences doing triple duty for setting, character, and theme. There is some tendency toward lushness and repeated rhetorical constructions (“thick with the brine of centuries and the silence of things long forgotten”; several sun/seed/flower-opening similes), but clarity remains intact. Momentum is gentle yet sustained; no obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops bog the piece down. The line-level craft is strong, just shy of the ruthless compression and variation demanded for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing double or triple duty (world, emotion, theme). However, figurative language is nearly continuous—“leaves fell like whispered confessions,” bark “like pages,” fountain “dry as old bone,” etc.—creating a mild purple-prose sheen and some momentum drag. The rhythm tends toward long, similarly cadenced sentences, which risks a soft monotony in a piece that could benefit from a few sharper, plainer beats. Clarity remains high and there are no major artifacts, but tightening a few metaphors and varying sentence energy would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, images are precise, and most description carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). The rhythm alternates effectively between long, sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic ones, supporting the story’s meditative yet pressurized feel. There is some risk of purple prose and density of metaphor (e.g., multiple “particular” bittersweetness/reverie formulations), but it does not genuinely obscure sense or momentum. Trimming one or two abstract restatements would make the emotional beats land even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and dense with imagery, and there are few, if any, grammatical slips. The recurring images (sand, smoke, coin, clouds) are mostly coherent and purposeful. That said, figurative language is highly saturated—often multiple metaphors or intensifiers per sentence—and occasionally tips into purple or redundant phrasing (“not unscathed but unbowed, not healed but healing”). This over-ornamentation slightly dulls impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character at once). Figurative language is rich but mostly precise and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Pacing is well-modulated, with descriptive density easing off where summary is needed. A few slightly abstract phrases (“temporal residue,” “deflating dusk”) may feel a hair mannered, but they don’t impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is often strong, with dense images doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, theme) and generally clean syntax. There is some purple-leaning repetition of abstractions—“patterns,” “approximated infinity,” “sentiment that transcended logic”—that could be tightened without loss. Most sentences carry weight, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. The closure image is clear and not obscured by figurative excess, but a touch more concision would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensuous, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (“greenhouse exhaled its concentrated green breath,” “thundering calm”) is consistent and legible; the lyricism rarely muddies sense. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and momentum holds despite a reflective mode. A slight cap comes from occasional edging toward purple prose and abstraction in thematic lines, but it does not materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: imagery like “obsidian ridge…like a sea of frozen flames” and the carved rake inscriptions achieve density without obscuring sense. Sentences vary in length and rhythm appropriately, and there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A couple of abstract phrases (“ethically diligent reputation,” “restore shared balance”) lean conceptual, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose balances lyricism and precision at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level writing is generally precise and fluent, with strong images and minimal redundancy. Metaphors (“velveteen gloom,” “shadows that had the texture of deep velvet, absorbing sound and time alike”) are mostly coherent and not overstacked. There are a few slightly ornamental repetitions and abstractions, but they don’t seriously slow momentum or blur clarity. Overall, the prose is polished and controlled, if not quite at the breathtaking level top-tier venues often prize.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally lucid and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty (image plus concept). Metaphors (ice as constraint, kingfisher dives as epistemic risk) are coherent and sustained rather than scattered. There is some conceptual repetition around constraint/innovation/patterns that could be tightened, but it doesn’t significantly bog momentum for a lyric piece. Line-level clarity remains high, and no major loops or muddled figurative clusters blunt the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is fluent and assured, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines pull double duty for worldbuilding and character. Metaphors and images are generally coherent and apt, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few phrases flirt with abstraction or prettiness for its own sake, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or obscure sense. Line-level craft is comfortably at or above the bar for strong literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are coherent and sustained (art/vanishing/ash/perspective) rather than mixed, and there’s little in the way of padding or scaffolding. The last paragraph leans slightly heavier on abstract phrasing (“somber marvel,” “incomplete information was all anyone ever had”) than necessary, but it doesn’t seriously blur the closure image. Overall momentum holds despite the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and thought (“not geological sediment, though there was plenty of that, but the slower accumulation of abandoned objects…”). Rhythm varies well between long, coiling analytical lines and shorter, declarative ones, and there are few if any genuine artifacts, redundancies, or muddled metaphors. At times the metaphorical load gets heavy—sediment, strata, narratives, pressure—but it remains coherent rather than purple, and momentum is preserved despite the reflective mode. Slight trim of repeated conceptual framings (“sedimentary layers,” “official narratives”) would further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing atmospheric and thematic work simultaneously. Metaphors (braid, autumn leaves as notes, traveled silence) are consistent and largely unmuddled, with little redundancy or scaffold. There is some abstract/therapy-flavored phrasing (“her therapist had tried to teach her years ago about hatred”) that slightly flattens immediacy, but it doesn’t derail clarity or cadence. Overall, the prose comfortably clears a high bar for literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly tight, multi-functional, and musical, with concrete images and minimal redundancy. Figurative language (e.g., “iron bones weeping orange tears”) is vivid and controlled enough not to tip into purple prose, and different sentences carry different syntactic shapes. There are a few lines that stack abstractions (“knowledge that couldn’t be written, couldn’t be owned, couldn’t be controlled”) rather than grounding them in fresh image, which slightly blunts momentum. Still, there are no notable loops, clarity issues, or scaffolding artifacts, and the final line lands with clean, charged diction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) and rhythm varies nicely. The honey/nectar/storm imagery is consistent and mostly disciplined rather than purple. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or clunky exposition blocks; almost every line works. A few metaphor densities (“honey and violets,” “warm honey” in chest) brush the edge of over-stylization but remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally precise, multi-functional, and rhythmically pleasing, with vivid figurative choices like “streetlights daydream” and “shard of hush.” Prose density is high but mostly justified; sensory detail and metaphor seldom feel redundant or incoherent. There are minor instances of abstraction or slightly purple phrasing that could be tightened without loss (“profoundly ordinary,” “quiet blaze of recognition”), but they don’t obscure meaning or the closure image. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) simultaneously. Figurative language is rich but mostly controlled; metaphors like “thread pulled from tapestry” and “light through water” clarify rather than muddle. There’s minimal redundancy, clean syntax, and no obvious scaffolding or template-cadence artifacts. A few abstract phrases slightly blunt immediacy, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often elegant, with some effective phrases (“peculiar vertigo of understanding arriving just when she had stopped expecting it”). Sentences usually carry more than one piece of information and maintain momentum reasonably well. There is some redundancy and mild purple-leaning abstraction (“bounded infinity that should have been impossible, yet persistently, stubbornly, existed”; multiple thematic restatements), which slightly blurs sharpness. Even so, clarity is never lost, and no major line-level artifacts impede the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean yet lush, doing double duty with atmosphere and character, and there are few if any true redundancies. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, and the prose flows smoothly with clear sequencing. There is a mild tendency toward repeated motifs and explicit conceptual phrasing (“methodically hopeful,” “proof that kindness echoes”) that softens the impact slightly and edges toward sentimentality. Still, nothing crucial is obscured, and momentum carries cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is elegant and dense: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and figurative language (“voice like honey dripping from combs,” “rosewater dread”) is vivid yet coherent. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax remains clear despite the lyricism. The only constraint on an even higher score is that imagery approaches lushness saturation in spots, risking slight drag but never quite tipping into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but generally disciplined, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept; images like “shadows backward instead of forward” are both clear and striking. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. The main weakness is occasional purple drift where figurative language clusters (“pure potential rather than predetermined outcome”) risks blurring rather than sharpening the moment. Still, clarity at the climax is preserved, so the line-level craft remains strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology, and the rhythm largely supports forward motion. Figurative language is frequent (“crooked tooth,” “liquid mercury,” “hand that had finally let go”) but mostly coherent and legible, with minimal mixed-metaphor confusion. There is some risk of purple saturation and conceptual abstraction in the thematic lines, though it does not seriously obscure causality or the closure image. Concision could be tightened slightly in a few places where phrases restate an already-clear emotional point, preventing this from fully entering the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with vivid images like the driftwood ring “like a wooden continent adrift in endless blue.” Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, and the metaphors hang together around sound, water, and resonance rather than scattering. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every sentence contributes either to atmosphere or to the acoustic premise. At times it edges toward lushness, but it doesn’t seriously bog momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rich, dense, and largely efficient: most sentences do double duty in world-building and mood while advancing Mira’s situation. Metaphors like the sun “pour[ing] through the cloudless sky like something dying” are striking and aligned with tone, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. A visible glitch (“who测绘ing”) and the overall ornamental density in places nudge against clarity slightly, suggesting a need for minor tightening. Nonetheless, momentum holds and the closure image is clean and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often striking, with strong openings (“cathedral more than a place of transit”) and dense, multi-functioning sentences. Yet it occasionally drifts into overwriting and conceptual redundancy, with long sentences stacking abstractions (“the work of rescue—rescuing truth from its pit of convenient concealment”) that slow momentum. Several sentences paraphrase the same idea in slightly different language, creating a mild sense of thematic looping. Line-level craft is above-average and clean, but tighter pruning and more concrete, embodied moments under pressure would elevate it to top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with minimal redundancy and strong, concrete imagery doing multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and mostly coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess even in dense descriptive passages. Exposition is efficiently woven into scene, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping to drag momentum. A touch more restraint on abstract formulations in the thematic middle could sharpen the impact of the best images, but overall the prose is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense but mostly disciplined, with images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (sediment, water through stone, reclaimed stillness). Sentences vary in length and carry momentum despite the reflective mode, and there’s little true scaffolding or repetition. Occasional phrasing issues and slightly abstract formulations (“tranquilly perceptive in the way that long practice creates”) keep it from feeling utterly knife-sharp. A light line edit would likely make this fully publication-ready at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, dense, and multi-functional, often advancing setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, and there is little visible scaffold or redundancy. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, which in places risks purple density and could, for some readers, slightly blunt momentum and impact. A touch more spareness around key emotional beats might make those moments cut even deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is dense and elegant, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme at once) and very few redundancies. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt—the geode as “secret the earth kept too long,” unused potential “pooled like water in the craters of abandoned futures”—and the rhythm varies well. The prose skirts purple but maintains clarity, and repeated motifs feel intentional rather than looped scaffold. Minor repetition of concepts (“unused potential”) is thematic rather than symptomatic, so momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that mostly carry their weight (e.g., the press’s rhythm “like a heartbeat,” the dome framing twilight). The prose sustains a consistent, almost incantatory rhythm without obvious loops or scaffolding, and nearly every line advances character, world, or theme. There are moments of conceptual stacking (“brilliant and dim at once, a glow that illuminated without overwhelming”) that toe the line of over-elaboration, and the final paragraph leans abstract. Still, clarity remains high, and no figurative muddle significantly blurs the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid metaphors, clean grammar, and a good balance of sensory detail and interiority. Most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing mood, character, and theme simultaneously), and there are few if any true redundancies. There is some mild over-reliance on similar phrases and concepts (“weight of unspoken words,” “quelled” truths), creating a faint echo of purple prose. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closure image is sharp rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and mostly free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence adds either texture, theme, or character. Figurative language is controlled and thematically cohesive, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. A few lines verge on explanatory (“Mistakes could be recycled into wisdom, but only if you actually changed what you were doing”), which slightly flattens the otherwise strong image-driven momentum, but not enough to dull the closure. Syntax, grammar, and sequencing are clean, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most do double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. Figurative language is selective and coherent (“silent sentinels,” “stubborn as tide pools in drought”) rather than piled-on; there’s little evidence of synonym loops or scaffolding. A few abstract formulations could be tightened, but they don’t significantly dull momentum or obscure causality. The prose supports the quiet, reflective mode without tipping into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically pleasing, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and non-redundant, and there’s little evident scaffolding or synonym churn. A few constructions press toward purple or explanatory (“this labyrinth was not merely physical but philosophical”) and could be tightened for greater immediacy. Overall, momentum holds well for a lyric piece, and the closing image/phrasing lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority at once). Some lines tip toward purple or redundancy, with stacked similes and abstractions (“colors that had no earthly names,” “cosmic intimacy of this moment”) that add atmosphere more than new information. That density doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or closure, but it slightly blurs impact at peak beats. Overall, the line-level craft is polished and musical, just short of the razor-discipline required for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is often beautiful and dense, with many sentences doing double duty for image and emotion (“rivers of molten silver,” “origami birds made of regret”). However, figurative language is stacked heavily in nearly every sentence, particularly early, pushing into purple and occasionally blurring impact through saturation rather than selectivity. There are mild conceptual redundancies (re-explaining her motivation and guilt) that could be trimmed for sharper momentum. Overall, it’s strong, but strategic austerity and a few cuts would elevate it to publication-ready polish.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with images that usually do double duty for setting and theme (“gravity pools gathered like sleeping cats” is both vivid and character-specific). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Sentences maintain momentum from one beat to the next, and key information is not buried or unclear. A few moments lean toward abstract summary of inner work rather than equally concrete dramatization, which slightly reduces line-level electricity near the thematic core.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in structure and length, and most do double duty for image and theme without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned and coherent (“vibrant hush,” “silver words,” “captured stars”), supporting the lyric mode rather than muddying clarity. There are no major syntactic or logical slips, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. At times the prose skates close to purple, but it largely maintains precision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and information-dense, with purposeful detail and good rhythm. Key images—the faint amber glow, half-painted numerals, the resonant bronze—are sharply chosen and avoid mixed metaphors. A few lines tip toward abstraction or redundancy (e.g., restating her “calmly inventive” nature and the revolution’s inevitability) rather than letting concrete images stand. Still, there are no major scaffolding loops or artifacts, and the line-level craft supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: the prose is rhythmic, image-rich, and economical for its density, with most sentences doing double duty for world, mood, and character. Recurrent metaphors (heart/weight/wing; light as memory) generally cohere rather than conflict, and obvious loops or filler scaffolding are minimal. There is a mild tendency toward repeated abstractions (“sacred patterns,” “borrowed dawn,” “promise”) that could, in a harsher edit, be pruned or varied, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure the closure image. Overall, the language elevates rather than obstructs the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, with good syntactic variety and high information density (images nearly always serve character, setting, and theme at once). Metaphors are generally coherent and well-grounded in the story’s visual vocabulary (light, maps, storms, darkness), and the final lines efficiently braid earlier motifs. There is a degree of figurative saturation—almost every sentence in some stretches carries a metaphor or abstraction—which risks slight purple-prose accumulation and could benefit from a few plainer anchoring lines. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mechanical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often graceful, with some effective images (metal catching metal in sparks, the sundial’s shifting shadows). Information density is decent and most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, theme, character). Nonetheless, there is a tendency toward repetitive conceptual phrasing and slightly purple abstraction (“philosophical discourse made manifest,” recurring formulations about transformation and illumination) that could be trimmed for tautness. Line-level craft is solid but not razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, characterization) and are largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (“second heart,” “cathedral of pages,” “anarchy of circumstance”) is apt and coherent, not piled on to the point of blur. The rhythm breathes appropriately—longer, more sinuous lines for reflection, tighter ones around key reveals—maintaining momentum in a quiet story. If anything, a few abstract phrases (“blooming resistance,” “creating meaning”) could be slightly more grounded in sensory action, but they do not significantly dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished and purposeful: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Syntax varies and the rhythm adapts well between exposition, movement, and the closing image; there are no noticeable loops, filler phrases, or structural artifacts. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt, with metaphors that align (music, tides, timepieces) and avoid muddling the physical logic. A few formulations (“cloud-density and longing,” “slow invitation toward night”) are slightly lush, but they don’t impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, multi-functional, and rhythmically modulated, with imagery that is imaginative yet legible (“petals unfurling in impossible spirals that seemed to document their own opening”). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple, and it rarely muddies sense or causality. There is little scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and transitions between reflection and present action are smooth. A few abstract formulations and direct thematic statements are the only notable drags on what is otherwise publication-ready prose.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“as though the island itself were breathing slowly after a long fever”). Figurative language is mostly precise and restrained; while the piece is lush, it stops short of purple, and there is little redundancy or scaffolding. Information density is high yet clear, and the final paragraph lands a clean, resonant image. A few lines verge on over-stylized, thematic exposition, but they do not materially drag momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, with good information density and evocative imagery ("golden fingerprint"). There is a tendency toward slightly purple phrasing ("kindled humility") and abstract scaffolding in the reflective sections, but line-level mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but suffers from repetitive diction (e.g., "patient waiting," "patience," "patient precision" across three paragraphs). The lyrical style occasionally borders on purple ("quiet languages," "wheeled... with the patient precision of eternity"), slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. While some phrasing leans toward the abstract ("saturated with historical emotion"), the sentence-level craft is strong. The metaphorical systems (temperature as sound) are sustained without mixing, though the final paragraph drifts into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with a steady rhythm, though it leans on some clichés ("swallowed by the sea") and abstract summaries in the climax. The line-level craft supports the tone but misses opportunities for greater density during the magical operations.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("gently persistent" appears three times; "amplified quiet" appears twice in close proximity) creates a loop artifact. Some imagery leans toward cliché ("metal so cold it burned") or abstraction ("grief of proximity"), and the text relies on telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose relies on "purple" metaphors ("signature of salt," "liquid pearl") and abstract similes ("like the thoughts of earth itself") that prioritize poetic sound over precision. This density of ornamental artifacts creates a scaffold that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong rhythm. The density of figurative language ("origami," "polite atoms") in the climax borders on ornamental but remains controlled enough to serve the dreamlike tone.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mechanically clean, but the prose suffers from "purple" tendencies and stock imagery (e.g., "dust motes dancing like memories," "green scent... like a blessing"). The heavy reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("deliberate darkness," "stagnant air") slows the rhythm and reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally evocative, but lexical tics mar the polish (the word "particular" is used as a modifier three times in similar constructions). Some metaphors lean into abstraction ("flames the color of things unsaid") rather than the concrete sensory precision established by the synesthesia premise.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    Significant deduction for lexical loops: distinct phrases like "quietly savvy," "luminous disbelief," "destiny's door," and "reinterpretation" are each repeated verbatim within a short word count. This creates a scaffolded, repetitive rhythm that dulls the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level polish is marred by specific flaws: "temperamental temperament" (redundancy) and "un Freezing" (erratic capitalization). The prose tends toward purple ("icicles weep") and adjective-heavy description.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from "simile churn," relying heavily on "like [noun]" constructions ("like tide against rock," "like a coordinated punch," "like spilled milk," "swam like ghosts," "like a shield"). These artifacts create a repetitive cadence and dilute the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetitive artifacts mar the prose; "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" alternate mechanically four times in a short text, and "mildly obsessed" appears twice as a static label. These loops, combined with abstract phrasing ("topology of shadow"), reduce line-level density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("registered," "categorize," "reason," "understands") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but occasionally repetitive ("held its breath... held tears" in the first sentence) and overly reliant on abstract phrasing ("attribute of being ambiguously clear"). The flow is smooth, but the density of metaphorical exposition slows the narrative momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery. There are minor "telling" artifacts ("The action was ritual, yes, but also necessary") and filter verbs ("Elara recognized," "She could see") that slightly distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is generally functional, but the forced repetition of prompt phrases ("mechanically warm," "subdued awakenings") creates unnatural loops. "Mechanically warm" appears three times, becoming a distracting artifact rather than a rhythmic device.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but relies on familiar clichés ("waiting like an old friend," "hung in the air like a question mark") to describe key moments. Abstract phrasing often replaces concrete physical detail during the musical performance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery ("static image," "monument"). However, abstract phrasing in key moments ("tasted like... regret," "understood with sudden clarity") tells rather than shows the emotional reality, slightly diminishing the immediacy of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    Competent flow is marred by clichéd phrasing ("truth she had swallowed," "poisoned everything") and abstract telling ("religiously skeptical nature"). These artifacts flatten the emotional impact of the climax and reduce the prose's literary distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished and rhythmic, with high image density ("vines threaded," "folds had gone soft"). The prose creates a strong meditative texture, though it occasionally leans on abstract nouns to carry emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is mechanically clean and rhythmically competent, but suffers from "therapy-speak" artifacts and abstract labeling ("liminal space," "something sacred"). These descriptors dilute the immediacy of the scene, replacing concrete action with interpretative summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from a density of "writerly" metaphors (e.g., "language of ash," "tools of brass and patience") that can feel precious. The imagery is strong, though the reliance on adjectival and figurative descriptions sometimes slows momentum. Line-level control is otherwise solid, with no major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, moving with the "flow" the story describes. However, the use of stock phrases like "the irony was not lost on him" and "paths of least resistance" flattens the texture in moments that call for sharper, more idiosyncratic description.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery. A minor phrasing stumble in the opening sentence ("church of St. Bartholomew's dimensional anchor") momentarily trips the ear, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasionally overwrought ("crystalline song," "mathematics of time folded"). The imagery is dense, sometimes prioritizing poetic sound over precise meaning. The line-level craft is competent, supporting the dreamlike quality of the story without major mechanical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, though the reliance on abstract nouns (defiance, possibilities, integration) reduces impact. The phrase "procedural generation" clashes tonally with the "ancient clay tablet" aesthetic, feeling like a prompt insertion rather than organic vocabulary for the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("pool rather than pass"), but is marred by the logical artifact of the "seasons turned" sentence. Occasional abstractions ("architecture of her silenced world") replace concrete action in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, though it leans heavily on summary and exposition to convey the conspiracy details ("The ministry had been dumping..."). Sentence structures are competent but occasionally repetitive in their subject-verb rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    Functional and readable, but marred by awkward modifier stacks ("aromatically cautious attention") and frequent filter verbs ("Mirabel saw," "Mirabel understood") that distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm and syntax are controlled, but the prose suffers from abstract nouns ("texture of time," "intention") and telling ("Mira understood that..."). The direct insertion of the prompt phrase "ethically playful part of Mira's nature" creates a clunky moment of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, effectively using anaphora ("played for the trees... for the ships") to build momentum. However, occasional adjectival pairing ("precious and fragile," "raw and searching") and slight metaphor density in the middle section soften the impact of the stronger, concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmically controlled, though the peak emotional imagery relies on stock phrases ("letters never sent," "rearranged the furniture") that blunt the impact. These clichés reduce the freshness of the insight, despite otherwise competent line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by occasional clichés ("sound like a whispered secret") and telling-via-labels ("whimsically attentive," "cautious exuberance"). These artifacts dampen the immediacy and density of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with good information density. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("feeling," "saw," "understood") and slightly abstract metaphors ("questions she hadn't learned to ask") that distance the reader from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("realized," "noticed") and adverbial scaffolding ("Carefully, deliberately") that drains immediacy. The reliance on abstract phrasing ("suspended emptiness," "interrupted cadence") weakens the sensory density of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm but suffers from adjective-noun stacking ("deliberate imperfection," "patient nourishment") and occasionally strained metaphors ("stone that had learned to breathe"). These stylistic artifacts sometimes obscure clarity for the sake of poetic sound.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe text artifact (the Chinese characters "not遗言" appearing mid-sentence) disrupts the prose. The writing suffers from repetitive phrasing ("kindly methodical," "sapphire hush") and adjective stacking that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with imagery. While generally strong, occasional phrases like "particular perfume of transformation" veer slightly into abstraction. There are no scaffold artifacts or loops, and the sentence-level propulsion supports the story’s introspective pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    A significant text artifact ("a南方 shower") disrupts immersion in the second paragraph, suggesting a generation error or unedited typo in a flawless-target piece. Additionally, abstract phrasing like "wry defiance of entropy" and the thematic summary at the end reduce line-level momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and readable, though it leans on some familiar similes ("yawned... like a mouth") and abstract phrasing. The density is good, but the reliance on internal summary for the climax ("Varen noticed this phenomenon without understanding it") softens the immediate line-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with clear imagery, though filter verbs ("experienced visions," "felt a vision") occasionally distance the reader from the immediate sensation. Phrasing is generally efficient but lacks propulsive rhythm in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from metaphor density and repetitive phrasing, specifically the triple use of the clunky epithet "analytically artistic." High-density imagery ("breath released from ancient lungs") often distracts from the action, and the "phantom train ticket punch" is a cumbersome noun phrase to repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with a good balance of description and action. There are minor tendencies toward "purple" phrasing ("prayers offered to an indifferent universe") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") that distance the reader slightly during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but dense with abstract nouns ("novelty," "omnipotence," "fury") that distance the reader. Several scaffold sentences ("Something was happening to space itself") tell the reader what to imagine rather than showing the phenomenon directly.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    A glaring typo in the first paragraph ("inconvenibly" instead of "inconveniently") undermines the polish required for top-tier publication. While there are lovely phrases like "strange deathly vitality," the prose occasionally leans into telling over showing, particularly in summarizing Elena’s internal realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from metaphor density that slows propulsion ("heartbeat found in electricity," "frozen spirals," "light through water," "seeds scattered"). While mechanically clean, the writing relies on "scaffold" phrases ("She did not invent histories out of fancy but from evidence") and clichéd imagery that dilutes the text's specific power.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    Imagery is vivid ("soft as cloth," "ghost marks"), creating a strong textural experience. However, filter verbs ("recognized," "understood") occasionally distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, though marred by occasional clichés like "dark as dead eyes." The reliance on abstract nouns and thought verbs in the second half slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished but leans on filter verbs ("Mira watched," "Mira understood") and somewhat stock imagery ("quiet tide," "floating diamonds") that creates distance. Density is often achieved through adjectival stacking rather than concrete action or fresh sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    While polished, the prose relies on stock metaphors ("blazed like scattered diamonds," "held breath") and the "Somewhere on Earth" closing cadence is a generic trope. These artifacts flatten the emotional impact of the otherwise capable technical descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is mechanically sound but relies on summary for the critical repair action. The prompt phrase "heartfelt artisan" is used as a repetitive label, and the text tells rather than shows the significance of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery; the "frost on the window" line is particularly strong. The rhythm supports the contemplative tone without dragging, though a few phrases (ghosts in walls) lean toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and lyrical with high information density. Phrasing like "footfall a question posed to the sleeping stone" is excellent. Minor botanical confusion between "ironwood tree" and "ebony fork" (unless referring to color) is a negligible flaw in a fantasy context.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.5)
    Significant line-level flaws undermine the polish: a text artifact/glitch in the protagonist's name ("Marina羲悬"), a subject-verb agreement error at the climax ("she unsnarl"), and repetitive diction ("gathered" appears five times, "gathered hush" three times). These errors break immersion and signal a need for rigorous proofreading.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the prose is often lyrical, the text suffers significantly from "keyword stuffing" artifacts. The phrase "copperlight repose" appears four times and "sustained impossibilities" three times in a short space, creating a repetitive template cadence that distracts from the narrative flow. These repetitions feel like forced insertions rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    Immediate rejection-level flaws are present: simple grammatical errors ("a alchemist," "a installment") and a catastrophic text-generation artifact ("transformed into婚礼头纱 of moonlight") where Chinese characters replace English text. These errors render the piece unpublishable despite the strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies heavily on abstraction ("strands of intention," "ghosts of precedent") which weakens the physical reality of the magic. A significant grammatical/tense error in the climax ("Her orchid solace bloom in her chest") disrupts the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory details. However, the score is capped by the forced insertion of prompt phrases as abstract labels ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") which disrupt the "show, don't tell" principle.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong and polished. However, the required phrase "carefully inventive" results in clunky abstract noun phrases ("carefully inventive mind," "carefully inventive hope") that feel like prompt artifacts rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with modifiers, creating a sluggish rhythm ("constellations blooming," "perpetual twilight"). Reliance on standard similes ("like whispered secrets," "like water through stone") and abstract phrasing ("faint threads of possibility") dilutes the imagery. The piece is significantly over-length for its content, needing rigorous pruning of decorative adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but leans heavily on abstract metaphors ("apologies that rotted," "calcified around her heart") that distance the reader from immediate action. Repetitive use of "condensation" and some explanatory scaffolding in the final beats drag the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and meets the "literary" tone requirement with strong phrasing like "vernacular of shrapnel." There is a slight tendency toward adjectival stacking ("eternal, misty embrace," "lotus-hearted and ancient") that threatens to overcrowd the imagery, but the line-level rhythm remains propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished but relies on several familiar metaphors ("broken teeth," "ghosts of themselves," "first green shoot of spring") that dull the imagery's impact. The sentence structure is varied and maintains good momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.5)
    While imagery is often lovely, two significant grammatical/usage breaks mar the line-level craft ("approached her work methodically playful" and "felt herself bewitch"). These artifacts halt momentum and require editing for publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.9)
    A template cadence artifact drags the score: the construction "particular [noun] of [noun]" appears four times ("particular warmth," "particular rhythm," "particular candidcryptic quality," "particular warmth"), creating a repetitive loop. Additionally, "candidly cryptic" is reused, reducing its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm but is dense with summary and filter verbs ("She finds this method," "She has learned," "She has grown accustomed"). The reliance on abstract metaphor ("architecture of verse," "greenhouse of the spirit") distances the reader from the concrete reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but suffers from repetitive phrasing (e.g., "opal" appears four times; the unique epithet "foxglove regret" is used twice verbatim). The style leans toward the "purple" ("marble spun into glass"), prioritizing poetic sound over physical logic or causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally polished with some strong imagery, but the repetition of the word "unsnarl" (four times, including twice in dialogue) is distracting. The metaphorical density is high, occasionally obscuring the physical action in favor of abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose leans into purple abstraction ("fragmented light through clouds of grief," "eternal negotiation") and explanatory telling. High density of filter verbs and "diagnostic label-speak" weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically sound, but relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("specific grief," "perfume... she grew to need") and filter verbs ("Eleanor understood at last"). These artifacts of "telling" reduce the immediacy of the epiphany, keeping the reader observing the emotion rather than experiencing it.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished with a pleasing rhythmic flow and strong sensory details. There is a tendency toward "purple" abstraction, but the line-level craft effectively supports the dream-logic tone without confusing artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "fever dream dreamed" tautology in the first sentence sets a repetitive rhythm, and the continuity error regarding the feather's location (cabinet vs. hand) indicates a lack of line-level precision. Adverb-adjective pairings like "careful patience" and "softly ingenious" dilute the vividness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is polished but overwritten with adjectives and reliant on clichés ("dropped like stones"). The vision sequence's filter-verb stack ("She saw... She felt... She watched") significantly reduces density and immediacy in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm and polish, but it suffers from abstraction and "purple" phrasing ("serenading monotony," "choreography of chance") that tells rather than shows. There is a tendency toward "thesaurus-itis" in word choices like "serendipity" and "happenstance" which act as labels for the action instead of the action itself. Technically clean, but the density of abstract nouns slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid but suffers from a heavy reliance on simile structures ("like water," "like sand," "like a canvas," "like salt," "like a second heartbeat"). This repetitive cadence acts as a scaffold that distances the imagery rather than embedding it in direct action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" abstraction ("noctilucent reckonings," "scripture") and occasional clichés ("holds its breath," "mirror"). Explanatory telling dilutes the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.0)
    Metaphor density is high and occasionally mixed ("landscape of her survival mapping itself"). A visible redundancy artifact appears in the middle ("splitting its light into fragments that scattered... like scattered memories"), and abstract phrasing often displaces concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns and suffers from significant repetitive looping (variations of "patient" appear four times; "hope" appears nine times). Sentences frequently restate the previous thought using synonyms ("scientific/artist" -> "logical dreamer" -> "rigorous methodology/imagination"), creating drag. The density of tell-y phrases ("revitalize the understanding," "profound transformation") displaces concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    A significant text artifact (the Chinese characters "现代" appearing mid-sentence) suggests a lack of polish fatal for elite publication. Additionally, the phrasing "sensitively perceptive eye" is redundant and clunky.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but relies on familiar literary tropes ("moved through the world like smoke," "grace that came from having never rushed") that lower the freshness of the imagery. While rhythmically competent, the density is diluted by abstract descriptors ("metaphysical glass," "dusky harmony") that border on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from abstract phrasing ("particular weight," "particular geometry") and the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("operatively gentle") as labels. The rhythm is smooth, but the reliance on explaining emotions reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is smooth but marred by a reliance on clichés ("pregnant quiet," "steel in her spine," "promise") and filter verbs ("felt the resonance"). These artifacts dull the sensory immediacy and flatten the emotional impact of the release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.4)
    The phrase "lullaby of conformity" repeats four times in a short space, creating a distracting loop. A syntax break occurs at "prisms sanctuary under starlight," and the prose density is weighed down by abstract noun phrases ("spiritual residue," "golden filaments") rather than concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and atmospherically dense, though it leans toward overwriting with adjectival clusters ("invisible waves," "luminous and terrible"). While the line-level craft is competent, the reliance on abstract metaphors ("excavated from the wrong end") sometimes obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is marred by the verbatim repetition of the phrase "her esoteric realist's mind" (paragraphs 4 and 6) and "overlooked histories" (paragraphs 1, 7, 9), creating a scaffold artifact that dulls the reading experience. While the sentence rhythm is generally good, the recurrence of these specific tags, especially during the climax, distracts from the action. "Blushing stillness" is a stylistic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm, though the insertion of the required phrase "technically gentle" creates a jarring modifier-noun pair. The density of figurative language is high, occasionally bordering on purple ("prisms of light," "infinite patience").

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose within the main body is dense and evocative ("leaves parting like curtains," "emotional cartography"), showing strong control of imagery. However, the final sentence ("Then she transcended") is a rhetorical collapse that undermines the preceding craft, reading as a placeholder rather than a polished resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant copy-editing failures render the text unpublishable in its current state, including untranslated characters ("脚步声"), typos ("duskyaccord"), and grammar errors ("diagrams has restored"). The anachronistic vocabulary further erodes the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from significant logic flaws regarding the soundless environment ("no sound emerged" vs. "You sound certain") and relies on dense, mixed metaphors that obscure rather than clarify the action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but leans on "poetic" abstraction ("constellation of sharp fragments," "permanent embrace") rather than concrete, propulsive verb-work. Filtering ("she saw," "she understood") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but the insertion of prompt phrases like "feisty" and "deciduous vows" feels mechanical. Some imagery leans toward the ornamental ("constellation of leaves") without adding narrative density.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjective density and "wonder" clichés (e.g., "impossible trees," "impossible weight," "luminescence... like ink dissolving"). The insertion of required phrases like "brightened disquiet" at the climax feels forced, disrupting the rhythm and emotional authenticity of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the general prose quality is high and atmospheric, a severe text artifact—the unmotivated Chinese characters "书架" (bookshelf) in the second paragraph—breaks immersion and disqualifies the piece from immediate publishability. Without this glitch, the score would be significantly higher based on density and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("swallowed... whole," "rippling like water"). However, phrases like "unkindled solace" and "narrative threads that stitched reality" lean toward abstract description where concrete grounding would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    While mechanically clean, the prose suffers from lexical loops ("warmly methodical" x2, "fables of absence" x3) that dull the reading experience. The climax relies on abstract nouns ("clarity," "confusion," "presence") rather than concrete, immediate imagery, reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is dense and generally clear, though marred by occasional filter verbs ("understood instinctively," "felt it wash") that dull the immediacy. Some imagery leans on cliché ("frost across a windowpane"), but the technical descriptions of the ice patterns are sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("thistle-blown hope," "lullaby of frequencies"). Information density is good, though the text occasionally leans into abstraction and overwriting. The sentence structures are varied, supporting a smooth reading experience, though the reliance on internal summary slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose has good rhythm and density, but is marred by several stock phrases and clichés ("hands long turned to dust," "sky opened like a wound," "hush... like a held breath," "surgical precision"). These artifacts detract from the otherwise high literary ambition and distinct atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density in the descriptions of the trade. There are moments of "purple" phrasing ("crumbling into earth for flowers," "siege logic") that draw attention to the writing rather than the scene, but the line-level craft is generally strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and high filter-verb density, which slows momentum. Frequent, explicit similes ("like anticipation crystallized," "like the surface of a pool") draw attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("intangibly tangible" x3, "gilded hush" x3) creates a scaffolded, mechanical rhythm. The mixed metaphor "stretching contracted" and cliché "sleeping sheep" further detract from line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery. Aside from one awkward phrasing required by the prompt ("worked fluidly logical"), the line-level craft is seamless and supports the story's atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.8)
    A severe text artifact (the Chinese characters "炽热" inserted mid-sentence) disrupts the reading experience and disqualifies the piece from immediate publication. The prose is otherwise competent but dense with adjectival scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetition of key terms ("careful/carefully," "suffocate/suffocating," "bridges") dulls the prose's impact. The writing is dense with metaphors that are explained immediately after being introduced, reducing their power as images.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the text suffers from some over-figurative language ("spaces between seconds," "beautiful lies dressed in"). The phrase "virtuously mischievous" is clunky and disrupts the flow. Line-level craft is competent but lacks the precision of the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is generally competent but suffers from overwriting ("eloquently silent of secrets" is grammatically awkward). The text ending mid-word ("echoe") is a disqualifying production error that ruins line-level integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.5)
    "Phosphorescent luminescence" is a tautology that weakens the opening description. The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("unwavering blade," "silent cultivation") that reduce momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.2)
    Immediate disqualification for professional publication due to basic syntax errors in the opening line ("Mara unfurl") and nonsensical constructions ("examining unknown the evidence") that obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by a significant grammatical error ("the lagoon had reappear each time"). Additionally, phrasing occasionally drifts into standard genre clichés ("whisper in the vast marble halls," "stubborn as memory itself") that reduce the freshness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is weighed down by repetitive phrasing ("prophecy" appears significantly often) and scaffolding ("He had been taught that," "It was not music as the world knew it"). The density of modifiers dilutes verb strength, and the repeated full-phrase use of required elements ("vested hush," "negative space") feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant line-level flaws undermine publishability, including a jarring tense/grammar error ("she prod the leaf's surface") and the redundant "always... always" artifact. Phrasing often leans on over-familiar constructions ("fingers of an old woman grasping for memory") rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional and clear, with some vivid imagery ("swirling leaves... danced"). However, it leans occasionally on clichés ("trembling script," "color of dried blood") and lacks the density or propulsion required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and sensory imagery, though specific phrases like "factually mystical" and "luminous regret" feel forced and slightly disrupt the flow. These artifacts detract slightly from an otherwise high-quality execution.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten ("music made of tears," "luminous ache itself"). The reliance on defining emotions through abstract similes rather than concrete imagery sometimes distances the reader. The density of figurative language borders on "purple" in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong and rhythmic ("dissolved like sugar in rain"), though the phrase "proprioceptively enhanced" is clunky and repetitive. Some sentences carry a slight heaviness from abstract noun density ("arithmetic of her wounds") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but relies on several clichés ("eternal instant," "everything aligned") and abstractions ("figure made of fog and gratitude") that dilute the imagery. These artifacts reduce immediacy and prevent the line-level craft from reaching the higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished and readable but reliant on clichés ("scratched record," "frozen lightning," "sputtered their last"). While the "dust... accumulation" description is sharp, the reliance on stock phrases in descriptive beats flattens the texture and prevents the imagery from feeling fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("night-sweat of reality"). Minor filter verbs ("She could see," "She felt") occasionally distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience, but the line-level craft is otherwise polished.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("burnished sorrow," "amber honey") with strong rhythm. The score is held back only by the tendency to summarize insights in the penultimate paragraph rather than trusting the dramatized image to carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from noticeable lexical repetition (words like "breath," "heart," and "remembered" recur frequently within short spans). High metaphor density sometimes obscures the physical action, prioritizing poetic cadence over distinct, fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with a high information load per sentence and a rhythm that mimics the story’s descent into silence. The figurative language ("ghost of rain," "cathedral's echo") supports the tone without becoming purple or obscuring the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from filtering ("she saw," "she thought") that distances the reader from the immediate experience. Some phrasing leans into abstraction ("endless curriculum of attention") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies on clichés ("glow like scattered diamonds," "pulse with their own heartbeat") and heavy modification. A grammatical error appears in a pivotal sentence ("reckon with what she was seeing" instead of "reckoning"), disrupting the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but leans heavily on adjectival density ("golden sea," "windless afternoon") and standard similes ("insect trapped in amber"). Repetitive phrasing ("mechanical lullaby," "mechanical sigh") slightly mars the lexical variety in a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by distinct repetition loops ("nothing and everything at once" in paragraphs 5 and 6; "nothing left to wish for" twice in paragraph 2).

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    A jarring text artifact ("expectation悬在半空") in the first paragraph disrupts the reading experience and signals a failure in proofing, preventing a higher score. Apart from this significant flaw, the prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density. The imagery is generally sharp and avoids cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on dense stacks of similes ("like a whispered promise," "like fingers reaching") and abstract metaphors that slow momentum. The phrase "furiously tranquil" appears as a forced oxymoron/label rather than a grounded description of a state of being.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, though occasionally functional in its pacing. The phrase "credibly curious" stands out as a semantic stumble, likely a prompt artifact that disrupts the otherwise smooth internal narration. Imagery is generally strong ("rose like a dawn"), though some metaphors approach cliché ("held breath").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is polished but overwritten and repetitive, with phrases like "yellow lantern glass," "overlooked era," and "flourishing stillness" recurring frequently in a short space. High density of abstract nouns (empathy, vulnerability, connection) and explanatory scaffolding ("This was not mere...") dilutes the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on literary clichés and stock phrases ("impossible lightness," "eloquence of silence," "ribs of... creature"). The use of "contextual clues" as a direct phrase disrupts the register, reading as an academic intrusion in a lyrical passage.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose rhythm is smooth and the imagery is polished. However, the density of abstract metaphors and the repetition of conceptual keywords (meaning, counting, measurement) creates a slight drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective stacking and forced constructions, such as "hands moved warmly attentive" (using an adjective phrase as an adverb). The density of modifiers ("reluctant golds," "pallid light") slows propulsion, and the rhetorical list in the penultimate paragraph halts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally clear but marred by a distracting malapropism or typo ("braze of calm") and some adjectival clutter ("gently systematic"). The rhythmic flow is frequently interrupted by expository clauses that explain the significance of actions rather than letting the actions stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose flows well but relies heavily on abstract genitive constructions ("chemistry of homecoming," "gravity of meaning," "alchemy of pilgrimage") that obscure concrete imagery. These stylistic choices contribute to a sense of overwriting that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.6)
    A disruptive typo ("fertilizeed") mars the climax, and the repetition of the phrase "submerged concord" feels repetitive within a short space. While the rhythm is generally controlled, the density of abstract nouns and adjectives creates a heavy, somewhat sluggish texture.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.0)
    Mixed metaphors reduce clarity, particularly "bloodhound instincts" translating "braille," which conflates distinct sensory logics (smell vs. touch). Figurative language is dense and often "tells" the significance of objects (e.g., "grooves that held secrets... like messages bottled") rather than letting them exist concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is marred by significant word-echo artifacts (five variations of "stretched" in the first half) and clichés ("heartbeat of a thousand calculations"). Abstract telling ("she understood") replaces concrete showing in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    The structural loop forces a near-verbatim repetition of the opening paragraph, which fatally harms information density and pacing. Line-level descriptions often rely on clichés ("pale fingers," "tear-streaked face") and filter verbs rather than fresh, concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is polished but weighed down by abstract phrasing and adjectival clutter ("benevolently ruthless efficiency"). Several key phrases feel like forced insertions ("nomadic penumbra of her existence") that disrupt the natural flow and result in "purple" patches where concrete imagery is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose flows smoothly but leans toward abstract metaphors ("architecture of grief," "thunder of impending change") that border on purple. The density of figurative language occasionally stifles immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally lyrical and polished ("breath rising in delicate curls"). However, the forced insertion of "moved with the fidgets productively habit" creates a jarring grammatical artifact that disrupts the flow. Without this stumble, the score would be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose generally flows well, it suffers from awkward sentence structures used to accommodate required phrases (e.g., "Her attribute of being innocently mischievous..."). Additionally, some imagery is imprecise (a finger pointing "toward accusation" creates a mixed directional metaphor), and these artifacts distract from the otherwise solid rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is fluid and rhythmically sound, with strong imagery ("creature of living quicksilver"). However, it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("bead on the chain of meaning") and relies on abstract summaries of emotion rather than concrete signals.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from noticeable repetition and redundancy (e.g., "intimacy of someone who knew loneliness intimately"). Some phrasing feels cliché ("mirror cracked," "echoing darkness"), and the final sentence relies on a chiasmus that feels slightly patterned.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe text artifact ("essence,珍贵 as gold") disrupts the reading experience, signaling a lack of basic proofing. Additionally, phrased like "verbal equivalent of grasping hands" feel clunky, and the prose frequently overwrites imagery where concision would serve the tension better.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns (grief, solace, continuity) and summary phrasing ("Mara understood immediately") that saps momentum. The final simile comparing tears to the bronze foot feels mechanical, and the repetition of thematic keywords creates a sermonizing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory imagery and a clear absence of mechanical loops or scaffolding artifacts. The writing is dense and evocative, though slightly reliant on adjective-heavy description in the opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is competent but marred by cliché phrases ("puzzle missing its essential piece," "closed door," "walked on water") that dull the impact. While rhythmically sound, the density of modifiers occasionally slows momentum without adding necessary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the prose rhythm is generally strong, the clumsy repetition of required element phrases ("type foundry matrix chip" appears four times; "empirically intuitive" twice) creates noticeable drag and feels mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by tautological similes (e.g., "silver ink that wept... like a weeping wound") and repetitive phrasing ("captured fire... captured starlight"). The clash between "ember" and "cobalt" descriptors creates confusion that careful editing should have caught.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose relies heavily on abstract nouns modifying abstract nouns ("mathematics of intimacy," "density of presence"), resulting in low image density and a lack of muscular verbs. The text suffers from "purple" abstraction that obscures the physical reality of the scene in favor of poetic posturing.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from severe "simileitis," with a template cadence of "verb + like + noun" appearing in nearly every paragraph ("like a wounded animal," "like a prayer," "like a drunk dancer," "like thirsty earth," "like a penitente"). This repetitive scaffolding stalls momentum and relies on stock imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is generally polished but marred by a significant grammatical breakdown in the sentence "The humanize through occluded views..." which appears to be a prompt-force artifact. Additionally, frequent filter verbs ("she understood," "she found herself thinking") distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetitive phrasing undermines the prose, notably the clichéd "sudden clarity" appearing twice in similar syntactic positions. The physical logic of the "crystallized essence becoming the ink" is vague—it is unclear if the diamonds melt or are used metaphorically, breaking the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from a high density of "like a [noun]" simile structures (e.g., "like a candle," "like loosened strings," "like stones"), some of which lean toward cliché. This "template cadence" in figurative language dampens the otherwise strong imagery. The sentence-level propulsion is good, but the repetitive syntax limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density (e.g., "breathless interval," "dying ember," "quiet expiration," "ancient temple library"), creating a slow, ornamental rhythm. This over-reliance on modifier-noun pairings reduces immediacy and creates a template-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm but suffers from the repetitive use of "razor" (three times, plus "knife-edge") which feels like synonym churn rather than motif. Occasional clunky phrasing ("fjord quiet peaks") interrupts the otherwise smooth flow.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose has rhythm but relies on repetitive abstract nouns ("connection" x5, "invisible" x4, "permeable" x3) that dilute the imagery. The constant conceptual labeling ("particular quality of boundary," "geometry of human connection") creates a scaffolding effect that reduces immediacy and density.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished, but a distracting typo ("likelit compartments") disrupts the reading flow in the second paragraph. Some phrasing leans toward the melodramatic ("slow tears," "clover melancholy"), and the metaphor of "clover melancholy" is confusing on a sensory level. These artifacts detract from the otherwise solid line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally evocative but marred by a glaring typo in the opening paragraph ("a artery") and some weak telling ("ways that seemed impossible"). The density of expository "was/had been" constructions slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but dense with abstract nouns and adjectival pairings that slow momentum. The repetition of the specific phrase "haunted euphoria" as a label for complex emotion flattens the affect rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with evocative imagery ("catastrophe had carved open holes"), though it occasionally leans on filter verbs ("seemed to," "thought of") that distance the reader. There is a tendency toward expository summary ("This was how the best information always traveled") that slows momentum. Line-level craft is competent but dense with adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is rhythmically confident and polished but suffers from rhetorical repetitiveness (multiple "not X but Y" constructions) and adjectival density. The reliance on stock lyrical metaphors ("fevered dreams," "thirsty roots") softens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is polished with good rhythmic variety, but suffers from mixed metaphors (gardening "seeds" vs. signal processing "threshing" vs. "origami") that muddy the conceptual logic. Stock phrases like "corridors of thought" and the cliché of the tool "growing warm" detract from the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong but stumbles into repetitive phrasing at the climax ("particular rhythm of loss... particular joy" in the same paragraph). Some descriptions border on purple ("unreasonable beauty"), which slightly dulls the emotional impact of the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by passive constructions and past perfect verbs ("had walked," "had become"). The integration of required phrases is clunky ("approached... with volcanic tenderness"), resulting in purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally fluid but marred by lexical repetition ("auric" appears three times in descriptive phrases; "drum/drumming" five times). These artifacts, combined with some adjectival density, reduce the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery ("groaned in fog," "softened to cloth"). It occasionally leans into rhetorical flourish ("architecture of trust," "mycelium through soil") that feels slightly overwritten, but line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns (grief, longing, truth, meaning, trust) and repetitive sentence stems ("She understood," "She had learned," "She knew"), creating a filter-verb stack that dulls immediacy. The phrase "spiralingly calm" is an awkward adverbial construction that disrupts the rhythm, and the density of "tell" over "show" reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is competent but suffers from high metaphor density that obscures concrete action ("cradle those fragmented feelings like wounded birds"). The reliance on abstract phrasing ("boundary between what was and what might be") creates a distinct "purple" quality that distances the reader. Lacks the friction of specific, grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is fluid but marred by oxymoron stacking ("combative tenderness," "fierce gentleness") and abstract descriptions ("more elegy than silhouette"). These artifacts reduce precision and drift into purple prose during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("curl spirals free like a falling thought"). A few scaffold phrases ("The hush was remade, you see") and the expository telling of the protagonist's morality slightly reduce the density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentence structures are repetitive, with a high frequency of "She [verb]" openers in the middle section. The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood," "she recognized"), which dilutes the immediacy of the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose suffers from telling (adverb-adjective clusters like "innocently cunning") and a didactic final summary that explains the story's meaning. While mechanically clean, the writing lacks density and relies on purple phrasing at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though marred by occasional filter verbs ("began to understand") and summary statements that tell rather than show the process. The phrase "liquid courage" is slightly distracting in its metaphorical use for light, given its common idiom, but generally, the imagery is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is competent but overwrought, dense with adjectives and metaphors ("scattered like crushed pearls," "time's greedy grasp") that verge on purple. The explicit insertion of the prompt phrase "subdued ardor" as a physical descriptor feels clunky and forced, disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is fluid and polished, with strong rhythmic control in the descriptions of the rain and the cards. Minor deductions for filter verbs ("Maren saw," "Maren recognized") which distance the reader slightly from the immediate sensory experience of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose flows rhythmically but suffers from frequent filter verbs that dull immediacy ("I saw," "I felt," "I knew"). Cliché oxymorons like "terrible beauty" and "anguished joy" weaken the emotional impact of the climax. The description of the method ("steadily unpredictable") is slightly clunky, and abstract nouns crowd out concrete verbs in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose flows well but suffers from the "softly deliberate" phrase loop and occasional purple phrasing like "wet with emotion." These artifacts, combined with the grammatical misuse of "metamorphose" as a noun, detract from the otherwise polished line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but dense with similes ("like breath," "like scattered salt") that can feel decorative. Lexical repetition of "fragile" and "architecture" in close proximity and the explicit moralizing slightly drag down the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong rhythm. A few metaphors lean toward cliché (the "puzzle piece" simile for trauma resolution), but the line-level execution is generally precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose leans heavily into purple metaphors ("quiet violence of hushed thunder," "patient as thunder learning to speak softly") that obscure meaning. Several phrases are repeated within the short word count ("spatially imaginative," "incubate"), creating a sense of redundancy and scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "remembered stardust" appears seven times, becoming a mechanical placeholder rather than a vivid image. Other phrases like "shadowed rapture" and "unwritten calendar" loop identically, reducing information density.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from simile density (four "like" constructions in the final third), which creates a repetitive cadence. Phrasing is occasionally clunky ("occasionally everywhere") or melodramatic ("heavy in ways that scales couldn't measure").

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "the X of Y" constructions ("museum of questions," "chorus of probable miracles") and rhythmic templates ("like a farewell, like a beginning, like..."). These artifacts, combined with abstract phrasing, create a barrier to immediacy and density.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("hold its breath," "forgot their boundaries") and mixed abstract metaphors that clutter the imagery. Information density is low due to the reliance on vague nouns ("boundaries," "thresholds," "intention") over concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no wasted motion. Images like the "green with oxidation" bolt and "bronze dust" are sharp and specific. The integration of required phrases like "seraphically mundane" is smooth, avoiding the awkwardness often seen with mandatory insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is polished but relies on abstract similes ("dust motes drifted like memories") and adjective-heavy description that slows momentum. The heavy use of summary ("She moved," "She built") distances the reader from the physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high clarity and momentum. A few phrases lean toward cliché ("silence felt like drowning," "cemetery of living structures"), which detracts from the otherwise sharp imagery. The final sentence effectively synthesizes the setting and internal state, recovering the lyrical quality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose leans on abstract adjective-noun pairings ("thunderous serenity," "chord of possibility") that obscure rather than sharpen the imagery. The repetition of "awkwardly confident" constitutes a distracting text artifact that lowers the quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally polished with strong atmospheric imagery, but key plot points are delivered through summary ("Yara understood suddenly that...") rather than concrete dramatization. There is a tendency toward abstract phrasing ("weight of normalcy," "territory of transformation") that tells the reader how to feel instead of showing the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("faces melted into abstraction"). However, the inclusion of clinical terminology ("somatic," "nervous system") in otherwise sensory passages creates a jarring artifact that feels like an authorial intrusion rather than character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.9)
    Objective errors including "an wound" and a tense failure ("Mira redesign not the cards") mar the execution. The prose relies on clichés ("Crestfallen did not begin to describe") and heavy metaphor density that occasionally obscures the action ("fracturing into geometries"). The high frequency of similes ("like watercolors," "like old rope," "like fog") creates a repetitive cadence that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant loop artifacts and clumsy sentence structures harm readability, particularly the tautological "patterns that ephemeral patterns in spilled ink could reveal." The verbatim repetition of "wind-carved encampment" (three times) and "consciously wild" within a short space creates a template-like cadence that dulls the prose's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from "telling" (e.g., "She was bravely conflicted") and purple phrasing ("dizzying quiet" is repeated, "desperate fingers"). These artifacts distance the reader from the action. The integration of required phrases feels mechanical, disrupting the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong and the imagery is dense. The score is held back by the awkward integration of required phrases ("inculcated them with values," "senselessly perceptive") which feel mechanically inserted and disrupt the lyrical flow.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "constellations... stumbling arcs" and "hollow where fear used to live." Rhythm and syntax support the pacing well, slowing down during the moments of silence. No significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and zero scaffolding artifacts. Imagery like the clouds clearing to reveal the city "like an unfinished story" effectively mirrors the resolution. The repetition of the "orbits of regret" phrase serves as a deliberate structural bracket rather than a redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from wordiness and a reliance on abstract adjectival phrasing ("warmth that had no physical source," "frequency that seemed to predate sound") that blurs the imagery. Sentence structures become repetitive, particularly in the use of relative clauses to stack descriptions. Prompt-specific terms like "meteor hush" and "tether" feel inserted rather than organically woven into the syntax, disrupting the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished with strong sensory details ("exhaled its peculiar hush"). It occasionally leans into heavy simile ("like something trying to remember") or adjective stacking, but maintains good rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically sound but suffers from high simile density, particularly in the final paragraph ("like a heartbeat," "like dawn," "like holding an ember"). This clustering creates a repetitive template cadence that draws attention to the writing rather than the image.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally evocative but suffers from a jarring tense shift in the opening paragraph ("After the business closes [present], the shop became [past]"). Additionally, some phrasing leans toward the abstract or purple ("suicide of hope"), and occasional filter verbs ("sensed," "felt") distance the reader from the immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.2)
    Phrasing becomes repetitive ("fractal patterns" followed immediately by "fractally precise") and relies on tell-heavy scaffolding ("Mira's scientific training insisted...") instead of showing sensory disruption. The use of "somatic markers" as a repeated label flattens the physical immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and descriptive but tends toward overwriting with dense adjectival phrasing ("photographs made of warmth"). Metaphors sometimes clutter the line level, and the reliance on stating emotional realities ("echoes of ancient awe") dulls the immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished and readable but suffers from mixed metaphors, such as fingers calloused by "temporal manipulation" rather than physical work. The rhythm is steady but lacks propulsion, relying heavily on adjectival description.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.6)
    Mechanically competent, but the prose leans on purple phrasing ("wind spoke in hushed tongues") and stock imagery ("shroud"). The density of telling—explaining the significance of the pillbox and the codes rather than letting them work—drags the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm is smooth and the tone is cohesive, but the prose relies heavily on abstract nouns ("complexity," "essence," "continuity") over concrete verbs. "As if summoned by his thoughts" is a cliché bridge that weakens the causality of the barge's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is cluttered with repetitive loops ("thrum/thrummed" x3, "patience" x3, "flattening smoke" x2) and dense metaphors that slow momentum. The writing leans on telling ("phototropic to kindness") over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.5)
    A jarring text artifact ("small,红色叹息") in the first paragraph breaks immersion and indicates a significant generation or editing failure. Additionally, the prose relies on abstract telling ("wistfully pragmatic") and filter verbs ("She could hear," "she could see") which dilute the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with a strong ear for cadence ("ink swirling like marine life in an ocean of air"). While generally high-quality, the text leans toward "purple" modifiers and melodramatic phrasing ("organ which had beaten through ten thousand years") that can thin the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("pink petals bruised gold"), maintaining a steady rhythm. The score is limited by a tendency toward filter verbs ("she noticed," "she thought") and explanatory scaffolding that tells the reader what to feel rather than showing the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with generally high clarity. A few moments strain for effect (e.g., "ethereal grit... like a second skeleton" is a confusing mixed metaphor), but the technical descriptions of the audio-magic interface are handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is often overwrought ("origami made of shadow," "crystallized silence"), favoring abstract metaphor over concrete imagery. The phrase "prudently adventurous" appears as a conspicuous text artifact, and filter verbs ("Elara understood," "she wanted to struggle") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    While much of the prose is polished and evocative, the text suffers from distracting mechanical issues, including a missing space ("anytrace") and a jarring grammatical error ("had lance through") driven by prompt forcing. These artifacts break the immersive quality of an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant repetition artifacts mar the prose; "nervously confident" and "spongey dread" are each used twice in a short space, feeling like forced insertions. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings creates a dense, slightly overwrought texture.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    A severe text artifact ("never quite溶解ed") disrupts the reading experience and breaks immersion, disqualifying the piece from immediate publishability. The prose also suffers from repetitive phrasing loops (using "particular [noun]" twice in the opening paragraph) and overwrought metaphors ("wings of enormous, anxious birds") that obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.5)
    Significant text artifacts harm the score: the phrase "dusky harmony" is pasted in three times (voice, light, voice), and "perceptively calm" is used twice as a label. These repetitions read as forced keyword insertions rather than integrated prose, triggering the loop/artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished, but the central image of a telegram drinking residue from a dry, three-year-old flower creates a logic break that prioritizes aesthetics over physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is mostly polished, but the inclusion of untranslated characters (“his動作”) in the text is a catastrophic proofreading error for a literary submission. Additionally, phrased like “confession made solid by his own hubris” leans into purple prose that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sentence rhythm is generally smooth, but the prose suffers from adjective density and "telling" labels inserted to satisfy prompts. Phrases like "anxious elation" and "purposefully curious" disrupt the flow as distinct artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft suffers from noticeable redundancy ("fiercely gentle" x3, "impossible" x3, "trammel" x2, "inlay" x2). These repetitions act as prose artifacts that clutter the density and distract from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by specific artifacts. The phrase "insulating emotionally with [noun]" repeats in a way that feels like a scaffold rather than a motif, and "wrest" is used somewhat awkwardly for removing a cloth from a pocket (semantic slip). The repeated phrase "echo valley longing" reads as clunky and artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally strong but occasionally dips into "purple" abstraction ("woven from starlight") or slightly clunky modifiers ("kindly methodical"). The rhythm is controlled, though the "magic book" explanation slows the momentum at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is strong with fluid rhythm and evocative imagery, creating a dense atmospheric texture. However, the reliance on explanatory scaffolding to bridge descriptive beats slows momentum and replaces action.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally strong and rhythmic, though it occasionally dips into precious abstraction ("rust and resignation," "heartbeat of a hesitation"). The imagery is distinct, but the reliance on abstract pairings slightly reduces physical immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by a few clichéd phrases ("settled into her bones," "ripples through everything") and some therapy-speak ("fragile edges of self-forgiveness") that flatten the emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose suffers from "purple" overwriting ("mist pooled... like spilled memories") and jarring register shifts (mixing fantasy imagery with "propagation delays" and "scientific precision"). The repetition of "cautious exuberant" as a noun phrase is stylistically awkward.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and propulsive, with high information density. There is a tendency toward abstract sensory blending ("smelled of... impossibility") which borders on purple, but it remains legible and supports the magical tone without obstructing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is weighed down by adjective stacking ("practiced reverence," "quiet purpose," "radiant hush") and stock fantasy phrasing ("gossamer veil," "verdant light"). The density of figurative language in the climax obscures the mechanical cause-and-effect of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is competent but relies on abstract telling ("clarity of spirit," "alive with significance") and rhetorical parallelism that feels writerly. The repeated use of "vineyard hush" feels like a forced insertion rather than a natural descriptor for the specific environment established.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.6)
    Several clichés ("pink fingers of dawn," "scatter on the wind like seeds") undercut the otherwise polished tone. The "willing wings" simile strains specifically against the physical logic of a heavy coat in wind.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("drifting in the mountain wind"), but occasionally reaches for poetic gravity with mixed results ("eyes held the brightness of someone who had not yet learned to weep"). The "smooth as worry" simile is an artifact that feels strained.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose relies on repetitive sentence structures (Subject-Verb openers like "She lifted," "She watched," "She had learned") and passive construction. Phrases like "long golden shafts" and "steady as geological time" lean on cliché, and the rhythm lacks the variance needed to build momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm and density, successfully evoking the "functional geometry" of the world. However, occasional lapses into purple phrasing ("refused to forget") and clichéd abstractions ("geometries that shouldn't have been possible") detract from the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is marred by a grammatical error ("vows luminescence in the dark"—noun used as verb) and the awkward forced usage of "signify." Metaphor density is high but often mixed or abstract, reducing clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.8)
    A significant text artifact (the Chinese characters "隐藏" appearing in the first paragraph) disrupts the reading experience. Additionally, the phrase "quietly enthusiastic" is repeated as a label, and "wavelength align" is used awkwardly as a verb phrase, detracting from otherwise competent prose.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from simile overload ("like a stone," "like a promise," "like memories") and abstract "purple" phrasing that obscures concrete detail. The heavy reliance on figurative language creates a barrier to immediate sensory engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and competent but relies on several stock phrases ("hollow eyes," "fabric of the world," "chest ache") that dull the impact. The description of the water and stone is stronger than the abstract descriptions of emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=2.8)
    Crucial line-level failures render the text unpublishable in its current state: a non-English artifact ("brittle快照") appears in the second paragraph, and the opening sentence contains a logical contradiction ("midnight... at twilight"). Additionally, there is a subject-verb agreement error ("she spin stories") that disrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from "adjective stuffing" and clichéd phrasing ("lightning in snowstorms," "bridge between worlds"). The reliance on abstract descriptors ("impossible light") creates a purple texture that obscures clarity and blunts the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but relies on clichés ("wall of white noise," "knuckles white") and explanatory scaffolding. The density is diluted by phrases like "made manifest" that explain what is already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but dense with abstract nouns and metaphors ("membrane between imitation and authenticity") that distance the reader from the physical reality of the scene. Phrases like "ten thousand pretense shields" read as hyperbolic shorthand rather than specific, observable detail, reducing the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with high information density and evocative imagery; phrases like "wrinkled like a secret kept too long" land well. The rhythm is controlled, though the reliance on summary prevents the dynamic variation that comes from dialogue or active scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by repetitive phrasing (the clunky noun phrase "echo chamber tunnel" appears four times in a short space) and dictionary-style exposition (defining "macerate" mid-scene). "Mournfully eager" is used repetitively as a label rather than being evoked through description. High adjective density ("delicate nature," "stubborn stillness," "practiced fingers") slows the momentum and tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("time moved like honey," "mist... like breath," "words tasted like ash"), which slows momentum and obscures clarity. The phrase "interiorized exteriors" is a semantic crash that breaks immersion. The writing is polished but overwritten, prioritizing poetic cadence over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is marred by repetitive phrasing ("vivify," "stifling destiny") and clichés ("colors that had no names," "penny dropped"). The prose density is functional but suffers from these artifacts and some overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.2)
    Two significant mechanical errors ("creaked and settle" instead of settled; "a understanding" instead of an) undermine the polish. The phrase "serenely electric" is used twice in a short space, creating a repetitive artifact that feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is mechanically sound but weighed down by adjectival bloat ("resilient positivity," "particular electricity," "practiced ease," "genuine warmth"). These modifiers often tell the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("tensile strength of intention"). However, there is a reliance on filter verbs and internal summary ("She believed," "She noticed," "She discovered") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate experience of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally polished, but the hyphenation error "unfold-ed" in the second paragraph disrupts the reading flow. Additionally, the phrase "balancedly curious" is syntactically clunky, creating a stumble in an otherwise smooth rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but marred by significant stock imagery and clichés ("shadows pooled like spilled ink," "soft as moth wings," "impossible lightness"). The phrase "reel of hush" reads as an awkward malapropism or forced insertion, breaking the otherwise smooth rhythm of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by a distinct repetition loop in the first paragraph ("something else entirely" appears twice). A grammatical error ("gold seemed to warmth") and some filter-heavy phrasing ("Maren realized," "Maren understood") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but a significant grammar error ("had nearly swallow her whole" instead of "swallowed") disrupts the reading experience. Additionally, the simile "bleeding through spilled ink like tears through paper" feels generic compared to the story's otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has strong rhythm and sonic attention, but occasionally slips into abstraction ("spiral of meaning," "living calligraphy") that softens the imagery. The final paragraph functions as a summary explanation of the themes rather than a concrete closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line-level craft struggles with tautology ("gravity had always been gravitationally playful") and cliché ("ghosts of static"). The prose frequently stacks abstract modifiers ("frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed") resulting in density without clarity. These artifacts suggest a reliance on poetic-sounding labels over precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from a noticeable specific repetitive artifact: the phrase structure "something that might have been [noun]" appears three times in the final third ("remembrance," "music made visible," "gratitude"), creating a distracting template cadence. Additionally, the repetition of the "gap between knowing and understanding" phrasing feels more like a mantra than a necessary locator, contributing to a sense of circularity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is mechanically sound but marred by significant clichés ("eyes too old for his face," "spreading... like dawn"). These stock phrases reduce the specific texture of the world to generic literary markers.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from high artifact density, including purple phrasing ("misting hush," "whispering gleam") and cliché structures ("hands that knew..."). Sentence variety is poor, with the first paragraph consisting of extremely long, meandering syntax that dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional and rhythmic but marred by clichés ("soft luminescence," "impossible angles") and telling ("particular satisfaction"). The "reawakening began as it always did" phrasing deflates potential urgency by framing the climax as routine.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("residue of what had been felt") that tells rather than shows. The repetition of the phrase "hush of improbable beginnings" feels forced, functioning more as a prompt insertion than an organic refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose has moments of lyricism ("bruised plums") but suffers from tautology ("imprisoned himself in a prison"), abstract padding ("hush of cosmic possibility"), and missing articles ("surrendered to horizon").

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.9)
    Imagery is dense ("kelped wreck," "pulsed with pale light"), but the opening paragraph relies on several stock similes ("slumbering leviathan," "gutted fish," "splintered fingers") that reduce freshness. The repetition of the "chronically curious" phrase feels somewhat forced.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.3)
    Severe text artifacts (untranslated characters "标本" and "darkest暂停") appear in pivotal lines, breaking immersion and rendering the text unpublishable without intervention. Phrasing leans toward cliché ("fragile bud," "haunted look") and abstract overwriting, further weakening the prose's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose relies heavily on stock metaphors and clichés ("whispered prayers," "liquid silver," "memory of a memory," "fabric of a world," "white as waterfall foam"). While grammatically smooth, the density of "scaffold" imagery and abstract phrasing obscures the concrete action and reduces textual freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Polished line-level craft with high density and smooth rhythm, though imagery like "morning frost" and "summer stones" leans toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose quality is marred by significant repetition of prompt phrases ("methodically curious" x3, "whispered chapel" x3, "silence" x6), creating a forced, template-like cadence. Abstract nouns and telling-heavy constructions ("pregnant with... whispers") clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished with some strong imagery ("wreckage had its own architecture"), though it occasionally slips into cliché ("Death had become an old colleague"). The phrase "sophisticated melancholy" feels like a forced insertion that disrupts the emotional authenticity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    A distracting repetition artifact ("sequences of light... in sequences") disrupts the flow in the second paragraph. Sentence openings are somewhat repetitive ("Mira had," "Mira worked," "Mira understood"), creating a scaffolded rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm is generally good but marred by repetitive verbs ("elevator groaned" appears twice) and stock phrasing ("of their own accord," "thousand fragments"). These artifacts dull the otherwise polished tone and reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally smooth but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("quiet explosiveness," "quietly rearranged," "quiet explosions") and mixed metaphors (strings, spools, weather, catalogs). The phrase "dusty starlight particles" in late afternoon reads as a poeticism that breaks the character's scientific grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstraction ("unified wisdom," "fractally precise architecture") and poetic cliché ("heightened stillness") that blunts the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished, but peak moments rely on stock phrasing ("heart quickening," "thrumming... like electricity," "eyes burning") that flattens the emotional impact. The pacing is smooth, though the "diligently curious" label is a minor telling artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive patterning (artifacts) within a short space: "driftwood" appears three times, "frozen" three times, and "repair" three times, creating a synonym loop that dulls impact. Metaphors are frequent and sometimes mixed ("driftwood nostalgia," "buried seeds" in an ice library). The density of figurative language slows momentum without adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but heavily adjectival and passive ("gentle giants," "misty nothingness," "whispered against leaves like blessing"). The reliance on simile and decorative description slows momentum and distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant lexical repetition creates unintended artifacts (two uses of "across the hush of time's final ripple," two uses of "nested patterns," multiple uses of "bruise/d"). The prose relies on abstract similes that clutter the visual logic ("like the lines of her own face," "like old music").

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm, particularly in the description of the birds' signals ("three short, two long"). Some phrasing leans toward standard fantasy descriptors ("almost music, almost the voice"), but clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.5)
    A critical grammatical error at the climax ("The pieces fall into place as she watched") creates a tense mismatch that stumbles during the pivotal moment. The unmotivated slide into present tense for the ending reads as an affectation or draft artifact rather than a stylistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but leans toward static ornamentation and "purple" descriptors (e.g., "swirling sea of clouds," "crystalline branches") that reduce propulsion. The density of adjectives creates a textural richness that occasionally stifles narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm and contains strong imagery ("seeping into every molecule like salt into sea-weathered wood"). However, there are scaffold artifacts like "not metaphorically, but literally" and the tautological "emotions were emotionally contagious" that clutter the line-level craft. Abstract nouns (grief, trauma, remorse) occasionally crowd out more specific sensory descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with good information density. However, reliance on abstract modifiers (e.g., "empathetically decisive nature") and some repetitive sentence structures slightly dull the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is competent but suffers from abstract summary and oxymoronic descriptions ("chaotically precise") that obscure the physical action. Technical terms ("synaptic pathways," "helix-minded") are used as decorative buzzwords rather than grounded mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    A significant hallucinated word ("sprolved") in the final sentence disrupts the closure image. Additionally, distinct phrases like "clandestinely luminous" and "latent blaze" are repeated verbatim or in close variation, creating noticeable artifacts that mar the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished with good rhythmic variance. Some "telling" artifacts appear in the interiority ("Elara's sculptor's eye noticed what others would have missed"), explaining the perception rather than trusting the image. Line-level clarity is high.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is competent but marred by the repetition of the "thoughtfully/carefully [adjective]" pattern and abstract phrasing. The explicit statement of motivation ("come to understand that his motivation...") tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is polished with good rhythm, though phrases like "practiced grace" rely on cliché. The writing is generally dense and evocative, but the reliance on abstract nouns ("architecture of honesty") occasionally drifts into purple prose that distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, but marred by pleonastic phrasing ("olfactorily sensitive nose") and some repetitive sentence structures. The lyrical style occasionally drifts into abstraction, distancing the reader from the physical immediacy of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level craft is marred by repetitive phrasing (e.g., "porous stone" appears three times) and adjective clutter. The oxymoronic "whirling silence" clashes with the description of "sounds like distant bells," creating sensory confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished and atmospheric, with strong image systems ("fog... like a held breath" is a bit stock, but "air left fingerprints" is excellent). However, the integration of prompt phrases like "rapid adapting to conditions kicking in" results in syntactic clunkiness that disrupts the otherwise smooth rhythm. These localized artifacts prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prompt word "certify" clashes awkwardly with the high-fantasy register, creating bureaucratic dissonance. Repetitive phrasing ("sculpted hush," "unfettered") feels like keyword stuffing rather than intentional motif.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, though "avalanchingly quiet" is a clashing modifier that draws attention to itself. Some phrasing drifts into abstract telling ("harvest insights from failure") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of abstract nouns, reducing visceral impact. A visible grammar error ("The process disorient through deliberate ambiguity") disrupts the flow in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with good rhythm and sensory density. Minor overwriting ("grief of three silent years," "scattered Elara's confidence") occasionally tells rather than shows, but the line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally obscures clarity ("mist... like something trying to remember its own shape"). There is a reliance on abstract phrasing ("unfinished business," "emotional library") where concrete imagery would be stronger. Rhythm is generally good, but the "shifted hush" repetition feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is marred by clichés ("trembling in her heart") and mixed metaphors ("stoically sparkling," assigning a human philosophy to a light reflection). Abstract phrasing often substitutes for concrete description ("bridge built from geometry and grief"), weakening the visual impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished but relies on several stock phrases ("pale sentinels," "ash and memory," "stronger than tempered steel") that dull the imagery. The reliance on filter verbs and summary-telling ("Cael knew," "understood that") blunts the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the sentence rhythm is generally good, the text suffers from noticeable phrase looping ("murmur of half-remembered dreams," "green glass shard" repeated fully). These repetitions read less like intentional motifs and more like lexical stalling, reducing the prose's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies, relying on strained metaphors like "luminescent ache" and "fossilized prayers" that obscure rather than illuminate. The reliance on "felt" and "understood" verbs bypasses the work of showing the character's sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high simile density ("like thunder," "like a prayer," "like a dream"), creating a repetitive scaffold. The reliance on overt poeticisms occasionally slows momentum and draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good attention to light and color. There is a tendency toward "purple" phrasing ("living archives of human wonder," "quiet explosiveness") and the text relies on essayistic summaries of thought rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative with high information density. Images like "cobwebs of memory" and the sextant's "soft luminescence" work well. A few metaphors lean slightly heavy ("storm pressing its forehead"), but the rhythm and syntax generally propel the reader effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with dense adjectival strings and frequent similes ("glowed like a wounded heartbeat," "like morning frost," "like water"). The reliance on standard "light/dark" imagery ("ribbons of gold," "fragmented rainbows") dulls the impact of the stronger, unique images.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is polished but marred by a high density of stock metaphors ("dust motes perform their slow ballet," "sorrows like a sponge," "like a Russian doll"). These clichés flatten the emotional impact and signal overwriting in place of fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.1)
    Register drift is significant, with academic phrasing ("heuristically gentle") clashing deeply with the lyrical, timeless tone. Abstract nouns ("normality," "absolution," "persistence") clutter the prose, reducing line-level immediacy and density.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetitive phrasing damages the polish; the unique phrase "quartz hush" appears three times (paras 2, 4, 8) and "gently meticulous" appears three times (paras 2, 6, 8). Clichés like "breath catch in her throat" and "surgically precise" further flatten the prose quality.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the prose has evocative moments, the significant text artifact (untranslated Chinese description) and the low word count (under 600 words) severely impact immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is rhythmically competent but leans toward adjectival density and abstract metaphor ("tasted like possibility"). Phrasing like "terrestrially cosmic" creates a semantic blur rather than a precise image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished with some strong imagery ("tumblers fused... like joints"), but is weakened by abstract descriptors ("auroral sorrow") and clichés ("uncork"). The rhythm is steady, yet the density of adjectives sometimes impedes the narrative flow, prioritizing decoration over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("gold leaf... turn to small suns"). However, there is a tendency toward "purple" metaphors and similes ("wilt... like a flower denied sunlight") that feel decorative rather than urgent. The rhythm is generally good, though the heavy reliance on summary slows the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.5)
    While grammatically clean, the prose is frequently overwritten with abstract metaphors ("crystalline frequencies that could fracture meaning," "bell of the heart") that obscure concrete reality. This reliance on "purple" abstraction distances the reader and replaces grounded action with poetic assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally fluid but stumbles on imprecise hedging like "whatever passed for it now," which misses an opportunity for specific imagery. The "controlled burn" metaphor clashes confusingly with the "folding" imagery in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("following curiosity like a thread") and slight overwriting ("paradoxical quality," "monument to unfinished conversation"). Sentence structures in the summary sections become repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose contains a disqualifying text artifact ("surrender its方向盘 to circumstance") that renders the piece unpublishable in its current state. Beyond this error, the writing relies on cliché ("natural as breathing") and mixed metaphors (shawls, stalactites, webs) that clutter the imagery. The sentence rhythm is readable but often overwritten, prioritizing purple description over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is competent but laden with abstract metaphors ("rang in her ears like a held breath"—a mixed image) and repetitive phrasing ("gleaming silence" appears twice). Filter verbs ("she saw," "she sensed," "she knew") distance the reader from the immediate experience, and the metaphorical logic (gravity vs. memory weight) is sometimes muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but marred by the verbatim repetition of the distinctive phrase "tranquil blaze," which draws attention to itself. The prompt phrase "terrestrially cosmic truth" is inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm with adjective clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "eyes the color of old mortar" and stars as "corrections written in the margins." While a few phrases border on the aphoristic ("older perhaps than the concept of buildings"), the rhythm and syntax largely support the magical realist tone. The text remains clean of loops and maintains strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is polished, with pleasing rhythm and evocative imagery ("fluorescent lights that buzzed... like trapped insects"). The score is capped by the density of "telling" in the middle section, where information is summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose flows well but suffers from "purple" tendencies, treating abstract concepts as physical actions ("calibrated to intention"). The phrase "wisely enduring precision" is a clunky, adjectival insertion that disrupts the rhythm and feels forced by the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is weighed down by adjectival clutter and abstract phrasing ("layered frequencies," "whispering seashell") that distances the reader. The forced inclusion of prompt phrases creates visible artifacts that break the immersive quality, and the reliance on filter verbs ("she heard," "she felt") dulls the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose suffers from extreme simile density ("like delicate flames," "like cathedral ribs," "like fallings of gentle snow," "like a message"), creating a predictable, decorative cadence. This overwriting prioritizes ornament over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, demonstrating good control of sentence variety and flow. However, forced adjectival phrases ("scintillatingly somber") and repetitive sentence structures in introspection (Subject + mental verb) create a slightly static texture that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("archaeological rhythm," "metastasized"), with high information density. There is a tendency toward abstract telling ("contradiction," "arrogance," "paradox") that occasionally distances the reader from the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of figurative language that sometimes borders on overwrought (e.g., "flower made of static and lightning," "throat about to sing"). While some images land ("dying wasps"), the relentless metaphoric intensity flattens the dramatic peaks. There is a tendency toward "prophecy-speak" that feels generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is generally competent, a glaring subject-verb agreement error ("He sweeten the world's silence") disrupts the final section. The writing also suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and heavy filtering ("To his mind," "He found himself") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally functional but suffers from filter verbs ("Maren felt," "She understood") and "tell" artifacts like "sonic absolution" and "logically emotional" that disrupt immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant loop artifacts, most notably the verbatim repetition of "softly purposeful" which flattens the texture. Reliance on adjectival strings and abstract nouns ("restrained wildness," "volcanic memory") creates a density that feels overwritten rather than precise. The pacing drags due to a lack of sentence-level variety.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés like "returned with vengeance," "slipped through the cracks," and "sickening sense," which dull the imagery. The pacing is steady, though the climax relies on abstract summary ("disorienting clarity") rather than concrete, beat-by-beat action.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose is generally smooth, significant repetition artifacts mar the execution: both "aptly deliberate" and "vibrant hush" appear twice in verbatim or near-verbatim forms within a short text. These loops break the immersive quality and signal a lack of line-level scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("sharp in the way questions are sharp"). It occasionally drifts into slightly precious or adjectival phrasing ("unexpected geometries," "glorious absurdity") that softens the impact, but the line-level craft generally supports the fable-like tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on "telling" shortcuts at pivotal moments (e.g., "Maren's brightly attentive nature told her..."). The repetition of the specific phrase "brightly attentive" feels mechanical rather than rhythmic, and the firewall bypass lacks the granular detail needed to sell the feat.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with abstract similes ("like veins through marble," "like a swimmer") that clutter the imagery and slow momentum. The text relies on "purple" description and verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("weighted breath before reply") that feel mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    Significant usage and syntax errors undermine the literary polish: "an euthanasia" (phonetic mismatch) and "grown to grips reality" (ungrammatical phrasing). These slips are fatal at a prestigious level.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose contains distinct artifacts: the hallucinated character "她" and the broken word "rediscover-ed." Line-level craft relies on filter verbs ("Elias understood," "He felt," "He knew") which distance the reader. The "bled amber" imagery, while pretty, leans toward cliché and overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is rhythmic but relies too heavily on filter verbs ("perceived," "felt," "understood") and abstract labels ("strange honesty") that distance the reader from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=1.2)
    The text contains disqualifying mechanical failures, including a foreign character artifact ("soft梯形"), a subject-verb agreement error ("She press"), and a typo ("to.root"). Repetitive diction (four uses of "rusted" in close proximity) and cliché phrasing ("creeping thyme," "tiny lanterns") further degrade the prose quality. These errors make the piece unpublishable in its current state.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a repetitive "He had [verb]" sentence structure in the opening of several paragraphs, creating a droning cadence. There is also a tendency toward dense, stacked similes (e.g., congregation, saint, penitent, communion) that slows momentum. The "sonically reflective" description creates a slight confusion when it later "throws colours," mixing sensory metaphors abruptly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but suffers from a high density of "like" similes (ribbons like prayers, future like water, longing like ocean, fog like a question, garden like a mother). This repetitive figurative structure draws attention to the writing itself rather than the image, bordering on overwriting in an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and flows well, with high information density. However, the repetition of the distinctive phrase "luminous ache" (used twice in a short space) and some cliché phrasings ("instruments of some quiet surgery") detract slightly from the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is polished, with strong rhythm and imagery ("cracked into a perfect crescent"). However, the inclusion of abstract phrases like "scent of hope" and "architecture of grace" creates moments of opacity and "purple" description that drag on the otherwise crisp momentum. The density is good, but the abstractions lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("Elara understood," "she realized," "she saw") which distances the reader from the immediate experience of the magic. While rhythmically sound, these scaffolding verbs dilute the density of the action and discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("unwanted returned letter," "hollow chest echoing"). However, a few lines suffer from modifier clutter or scientific dissonance ("luminescence that no earthly calcium should possess," "absurdly like constellations"). The repetition of "shrewdly innocent" frames the story well but feels slightly heavy-handed in the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)
    A severe artifact appears in the text ("cradled in柔软的布料"), indicating untranslated placeholder text or a generation glitch that breaks immersion. Additionally, there are repetitive loops ("filtered light that filtered," "sustainable... to sustain") and the exact repetition of the phrase "reflectively vibrant." These errors suggest a lack of basic proofreading.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from the forced repetition of prompt phrases ("proffer," "quietly proactive") which creates noticeable text artifacts and syntactic redundancy. Clichés like "thrum of nothing and everything" and the stiffness of "proffer your presence" mar the line-level execution, disrupting the otherwise smooth rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level craft is hampered by metaphor stacks ("door of her creative doubt") and clichés ("better judgment"). The verbatim repetition of the setting name and timeframe phrase within a short space creates noticeable drag.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but marred by clichés ("brittle as autumn leaf") and a register clash between scientific lexicon ("DNA") and high fantasy ("sacred"). A grammatical slip ("impossibly large" written as "impossibly large" or "impossible large" context dependent—text says "impossibly large" is standard, but mixed metaphors weaken density).

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has good rhythm but relies too heavily on interpretive metaphors ("principles only starlight could reveal," "impossible geometries") that tell rather than show. There is a tendency toward abstract labeling of emotion ("cartography of a different kind") which dilutes the concrete impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished, rhythmic, and high-density with no scaffold artifacts. The imagery is evocative ("layer upon layer, like sediment forming stone"), though the density of figurative language approaches the purple boundary. The line-level craft successfully sustains the "wounded season" motif without it becoming repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Imagery is often striking ("shingled hush," "ancient lung"), but the prose suffers from repetitive diction ("weights of human weight") and occasional awkward phrasing ("almost pressurable"). These artifacts drag on the otherwise smooth rhythmic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally polished, but the repetition of specific words ("crystallized" appears three times, "patient conversation" twice in one sentence) feels like a crutch. The "lessons were these" section halts the line-level momentum, acting as a scaffold that should have been removed.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, though the density of similes ("like smoke," "like a garment," "like sediment") occasionally slows momentum. The final image of the plastic teeth catching sunless light is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line-level imagery is often evocative ("dark ribbons," "ghost of music"), but the mid-section suffers from heavy telling and time-compression scaffolding. The reliance on abstract phrasing ("heavy with intention") weakens the physical immediacy of the restoration work.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally smooth rhythm, but the text is marred by a grammatical error ("fully born" vs "be born") and adverb-heavy phrasing ("excruciatingly gentle deliberateness"). These artifacts, alongside some mixed metaphors regarding the "voices," create drag at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and dense, moving with good momentum, though it occasionally relies on repetitive sentence stems ("She had...") that create a mild scaffold effect. Some phrasing ("serene upheaval") feels slightly overwrought, but the line-level craft is generally competent.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on adjective-heavy phrasings ("infinitely patient," "reluctant seed," "fragile hull") and familiar similes ("patient as the tide"). While rhythmic, the density of modifiers slows momentum and creates a barrier to immediacy. Clichés like "small ghosts" and "return of light after every storm" undermine the specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is overwritten, with a distracting density of figurative language and cliché metaphors ("whispered confessions," "holding its breath") that obscures concrete imagery; the repetitive "X like Y" sentence structure creates a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery ("broken heart made solid"), but suffers from some abstract overwriting ("gestures toward beauty so painfully literal"). The "hypothesizing/hypothesized" repetition is a minor artifact, and the explicit "instructions" readout reduces the poetic mystery of the climax to a manual.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from overwriting, with frequent adjective stacking ("stubborn grace," "hungry orange dark") and mixed metaphors ("scars could sing"). The syntax relies heavily on participial extensions, which creates a smooth but occasionally repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but the forced insertion of prompt phrases creates local clunkiness. The phrase "realistically imaginative patience" is an awkward adverb-adjective pileup that disrupts the sentence's flow.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythmic control ("rippled through the luminous fog like thoughts through water"). However, the climax suffers from "telling" the epiphany ("Vael understood... that the gear was not malfunctioning"), and some phrasing borders on the abstractly ornamental ("approximated infinity," "mathematical space").

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose has a lyrical rhythm, it suffers from redundancy and forced phrasing, such as "words tumbled into the humid air and became part of the humidity." The phrase "thundering calm" reads as a forced oxymoron that clashes with the scene's quiet tone rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally competent with some strong imagery ("suspended sun"), but momentum suffers from heavy-handed telling. The backstory of the daughter's death is crammed into a single, overloaded sentence ("The rake had been his wife's gardening tool, broken in the fall...") that disrupts the scene's cadence with information density.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=1.9)
    The text contains a fatal draft artifact ("But the story must end... let me revise") and a verbatim repetition of the final paragraph. These are disqualifying flaws for professional publication. Additionally, the prose relies on repetitive phrasing ("velveteen/velvet") that should have been edited out.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose rhythm is sluggish, weighed down by abstract nouns and synonym churn ("fractured and fragmented"). A significant text artifact/glitch ("ignite连锁反应 of innovation") disrupts the reading experience, alongside missing articles in that same sentence, signaling a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is competent but overly adjectival and relies on "telling" emotions ("thistled calm," "peaceful resolve"). Rhythm is largely static, and the text lacks the sentence-level propulsion needed for a high-stakes broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has good rhythm but is weighed down by abstract phrasing ("veins of honest grief," "mirage of safety") that tells rather than shows. The density is diluted by these conceptual explanations and slight repetitions of the "transformation" idea.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("opened tomb"), but suffers from filter verbs ("I feel," "I find," "I calm myself") that distance the reader. Phrases like "My name does not matter" and "I find this cog's presence here... telling" act as scaffolding that slows momentum without adding density.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically smooth, with a strong sense of musicality in the sentence structure. There is a tendency toward abstract nouns and slightly "purple" description ("understanding arrives like weather"), but line-level control is generally high and free of distracting errors.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but heavily reliant on "purple" descriptors and metaphorical cliche ("opened like flower buds") that softens the impact of the climax. The final paragraph adopts a scaffolded, essayistic cadence that disrupts the narrative flow and distances the reader from the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is mechanically sound and rhythmic but relies on stock similes ("cracked like an eggshell," "rising like bile") that diminish descriptive freshness. The tendency toward overwriting ("nectar dusk," "honey and violets") prioritizes aesthetic adornment over narrative propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by a significant usage error where the verb "sanctify" is used as a noun ("through the sanctify of"). Occasional overwriting ("streetlights daydream") slightly clutters the otherwise clean sensory descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with some striking imagery ("terror bleeding through granite pores"). The score is capped by a reliance on abstract nouns and explanatory scaffolding that dulls the immediacy of the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and generally clear, with good density. There is a tendency toward abstract nouns and stated concepts over concrete imagery, but the sentence-level mechanics effectively convey the paradox of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but leans into abstraction ("language of light and memory") and occasionally cliché imagery ("like dying stars"). While readable and rhythmically sound, the tendency toward sentimental phrasing undercuts the sharpness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from significant artifact looping, specifically the three-time repetition of "rosewater dread" and the clumsy recurrence of the full "emerald-tinted opera glass lens" phrase. These repetitions create a checklist texture that drags down the otherwise competent line-level density.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose is generally evocative, significant mechanical errors undermine the "flawless" standard required for top-tier publication. The typo "builtdevices" and the non-standard, jarring usage of "rewinded" (instead of "rewound") in the opening paragraph break immersion and suggest a lack of proofreading.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and repetitive simile structures ("like a crooked tooth," "like desperate hands," "like liquid mercury"). Phrasing like "becoming something photographically cursed" and "attractiveness so repulsive" feels clunky and forced.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("wooden continent adrift"), though technical phrases like "fractal generating technique" clash slightly with the mythic register. The rhythm is controlled, though some descriptions of the method feel like expositional artifacts rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished with good rhythm, but it suffers from reliance on abstract summaries ("texture of everyday life") and filter verbs ("Mira knew," "She felt"). These artifacts reduce the immediacy of the action and blur the cause-and-effect in the micro-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished and grammatically sound but suffers from a density of abstract nouns and filter verbs ("understood," "believed," "processed"). The reliance on long, explanatory sentences slows momentum and keeps the reader at a remove from the sensory reality of the moment. The writing tells the reader what is happening internally rather than showing it through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density ("chains rusted to a deep orange that bled"). However, there is a reliance on simile-heavy descriptions ("like a broken tooth," "like widow's veils") that clutters the imagery in what should be high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.2)
    Two severe text artifacts ("official文字" and "construct alternatif hypothesis") indicate fatal proofreading failures or generation glitches that shatter immersion. The prose generally lacks rhythmic variety, relying on expository sentence structures ("She had been...", "She retrieved...", "She understood..."). These errors render the piece unpublishable in its current state.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is high-quality with strong information density and vivid imagery ("stirring inside it like a fish beneath ice"). The rhythm supports the meditative pacing. There is a slight tendency toward adjectival density ("insidious," "constant," "luminous"), but it suits the established tone without creating drag.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm, though marred by "telling" artifacts ("intangibly tangible," "perturbation theory applied to...") that flatten the imagery. The line-level density is good, but the reliance on definition-sentences to explain the character's state reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on stock imagery ("sleeping sentinels," "slipped through her fingers like sand"). The phrasing "brilliant and dim at once" reads as a slightly forced oxymoron rather than a precise description.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant lexical repetition distracts ("quell" x3, "manufactured" x4, "forgotten shore" x4), creating a looping effect. The prose density is high, but the metaphorical layering ("cancer of guilt," "bones of forgotten stories") often obscures rather than clarifies the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is rhythmically smooth but leans toward overwriting and abstraction ("mist curl up... like breath held too long," "space between apology and forgiveness"). While free of mechanical errors, the reliance on "therapy-speak" concepts (processing trauma, recycling mistakes) creates a distance that softens the impact of the concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is competent but marred by clichés ("faith flickering," "silent sentinels") and a confused metaphor ("tide pools in drought"). The anaphora in the reflection section ("She had regretfully...") feels mechanical and slows momentum without adding sufficient density.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from overwrought metaphors ("unremembered sins pressing... like something made of old lead") and clunky phrasing ("absent furniture's ghost"). The phrase "delicate robust colonies" reads as a grammatically awkward insertion of a required element.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe simile saturation (over 10 instances of "like..." used as crutches for description) creates a repetitive, shallow texture. Adverb-heavy phrasing ("paradoxically steady") and abstract modifiers dull the prose's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is evocative but occasionally overwritten ("choking beauty," "suffocating moonlight"). A notable repetition artifact occurs with "willingly perplexed, had been willingly perplexed," which reads as a stall rather than emphasis. The high density of abstract descriptors slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery ("flower blooming in time-lapse"). The text avoids scaffold and loops, moving with a grace that mirrors the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is competent but marred by repetitive phrasing ("vibrant hush" appears in two pivotal locations) and adjective-heavy descriptions. The rhythm is generally smooth, but the reliance on abstract nouns ("luminescence," "philanthropy," "transformation") dilutes the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.1)
    The specific phrase "calmly inventive" is repeated three times (lines 6, 21, 51) as a scaffold, creating a distractingly artificial rhythm. The prose relies heavily on adjectives ("vigilant," "confused," "luminous") rather than strong verbs to carry the scene's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on repetitive "noun like noun" similes ("like a second heartbeat," "like embers," "like morning mist"), creating a predictable cadence that dulls the imagery. Several phrases lean into melodrama ("geometry of the universe itself") without earning the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density ("lantern flickering," "sleepless oceans," "thinner than sound"). The constant use of similes and abstractions obscures the concrete action, and phrases like "storm-kissed wonder" read as cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but marred by the clumsy, full-phrase repetition of the "danish tin sewing needle card." The climax leans on abstract descriptors ("calcified," "illumination") instead of concrete verbs, softening the impact of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative ("pressed against her ribs like a second heart"), but momentum drags during the middle section's internalization. The reliance on explaining the characters' realizations ("The confession emerged like something that had been waiting") rather than dramatizing the interaction weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is elegant and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery ("bruised violet and tarnished silver"). There is a tendency toward abstract genitive metaphors ("piano... made of cloud-density and longing") that teeters on the edge of purple prose, but the technical execution remains high. Information density is good, avoiding unnecessary scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") and sentimental phrasing ("trembling fragments," "impossible spirals") that distances the reader. The description of the seed relies on a "no known spectrum" cliché, which flattens the imagery at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from abstract labeling ("cerulean regret") and adjective-heavy phrasing ("rhythmically placid whisper") that tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation. Reliance on explanatory similes ("like dawn light spreading") in the climax dilutes the immediacy of the image.

    High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; flaw: simile stacks ("like a living thing, like the first breath") border overwriting in peak transformation beat, dulling one closure edge.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively; figurative pattern (bleeding time, origami regret) taught early coheres without muddle, peaking cleanly in "pain bloomed upward" without loops or scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; purposeful metaphors (blooming dimension, stitched web) cohere without muddle or loops, though minor purple in "void that was not void" nudges from peak.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm varies (short hush sentences amid lyrical swells); density high but purposeful, no loops. Minor figurative density ("water through fingers, wind through paper") in release beat risks muddle but coheres texturally without obscuring closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density propels via multi-job lines like quill's "faint resonance seemed to intensify"; minor repetitive "calmly inventive" stems create template cadence echo but don't obscure closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or artifacts; high density propels via "living geometry that mirrored her painted rocks exactly" without figurative muddle in peak.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with varied syntax propels through storm peak; minor metaphor density in reflective beats ("cartography of scars") risks slight overwrite but pays off in closure image without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Good rhythmic variety and density, but minor paraphrase loops on brook murmur and Varn's philosophy ("understood that," "transform") dull mid-duel propulsion; no closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with purposeful lyric rhythm; no loops, varied syntax propels to closure, minor overwriting in metaphors like "architects of something small but whole" fits taught poetic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density propels via varied syntax mirroring musicality; no loops, purposeful metaphors (bruised violet clouds) integrate without muddle, even in peak arbor ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., path crushes "wild thyme and something else—something luminous"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak dream beat purposeful and coherent, not muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows with scene breath); metaphors coherent/pattern-taught (diffusion motif). Minor overwriting in descriptive density but no loops/artifacts dulling closure; propulsion aligns with reflective pace.


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “water recede from the cracked floor tiles while the sky outside held the bruised purple” marries action, setting, and tone. Metaphors stay coherent—dust as light curve—never mixed. One scaffold clause (“she understood, in that moment”) is easily trimmed; otherwise zero loops or synonym churn. No artifact appears in the final third; clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, sensory, high-density; most sentences do two jobs. Occasional modifier stacks (“delicate crystalline veins”) flirt with overwrite but keep within lyric allowance. No loops or scaffold; temporal sequence clean. One mixed image—“light breaking through glass” for a smile—slightly strains physics, nudging down from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic variety and information density, but front-loaded metaphor density (“musical notation frost,” “capsize survivor,” etc.) edges toward overwritten catalogue before the midpoint. No loops or mixed metaphors in the closing beats; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is scaffold-free; no synonym loops, no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“bookshelves rose like ribs” is the single overt simile and it earns its place by fusing anatomy to architecture. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror breath control underwater. Opening line anchors voice and anomaly; final line resolves through image that recharges prior motifs of light and vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line density high: “metal so cold it burned” does image + backstory + sensory in five words. No synonym loops; each return of “gently persistent” accrues new contextual weight. Metaphor vehicles stay local—bell as whisper, ridge as altar—without mixed logic. One buried lead: “she understood finally” could be cut since next sentence already shows realization. Otherwise momentum breathes with paragraph lengthening at climax then quiet snap.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath-unit sentences in twilight description, then clipped fragments under pressure (“elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere”). Information density high—one sentence often does description, interior, and world rule. No paraphrase loops; however, “something like mourning and then transformed into something like acceptance” is a near self-paraphrase that softens the climax, tempering the score. Figurative logic stays coherent; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds future causality (“spiral patterns...decades before she was born”). Figurative language is lush but patterned early, justifying its density. Only one mixed-metaphor risk (“sugar in rain” beside “origami of hours”) and zero scaffold loops. Closure line is clean, propulsive, and unburdened by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with participle, noun, adverb to avoid drumbeat. Figurative language is sparse, never stacked in the vault’s hush. One paraphrase loop—“prison and her purpose” / “prison and her purpose” in adjacent clauses—triggers −0.2; otherwise density is high. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; prop states track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: long breathy clauses mimic lingering light, then shorter fragments at train arrival. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—every metaphor returns to light or flora, avoiding mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“seventeen years perfecting…”) is forgiven as vocational mantra. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; final image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence drags. Figurative layer is dense but patterned (glass/ice/thaw) and pays off. One mixed metaphor—“weighty lightness”—is earned as thematic coinage rather than slippage. Minor scaffold: “slow and careful unFreezing” hyphenation tic. Otherwise momentum holds through 756 words.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breatheable; figurative language is selective and pattern-unified (stone, storm, star, silence) without crowding any single beat. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, fragments in the storm pause, supporting pressure. Opening and final lines act as echo-shells (“pebble-shore” / “pebble shores”), creating circular resonance without gimmick.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet readable; occasional abstractions (“cycles beyond counting”) slightly dull immediacy. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“shattered the illusion,” “hang in the frozen air”) propel sentences. High density maintained; minor tightening could trim adjectival clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with shifting parts. Figurative language is selective—“water droplets like held tears” appears once, not stacked. No loops, no scaffold. Strong verbs (“trembling,” “cutting,” “squeezed”) and concrete nouns. One paraphrase risk: “transparency” repeated three times in close succession, but each use shifts context, so momentum holds. Closure line is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers gardening craft, memory, and tactile detail without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—marbles as rainfall records, cracks as calendar—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “wisely pragmatic” appears twice within fifty words; otherwise no redundancy. Closing line varies cadence, letting the final breath linger.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, varied, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated lyrical lifts (“existing briefly in states that shouldn't logically coexist”) are earned by the speculative frame. Metaphors stay coherent—wings like pages, station breathing—without crowding high-pressure beats. Final line lands with cadence punch.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong variation in sentence length and paragraph shape; clauses carry double duty (action + atmosphere). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (water as cathedral mirror). One mixed image—“water damage spread like living things…in spreading constellations”—is fleeting. Density stays high; no scaffold sentences dull the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay physically coherent: aurora as curtain of pale grief, frost as branching rivers. High density—“fever’s absence,” “stone of grief,” “ damaged antenna” all carry double duty. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with pressure; no overwriting in climax. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective and paid off (“darkness had grown thicker,” then literalized by shift). Filter verbs minimal; verbs strong. One mixed metaphor (“electricity in his chest” beside “warm blanket”) barely grazes clarity. Closure line breathes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open differently, paragraphs breathe. High density: one line can set scene, reveal character, advance concept (“vines threaded…ecosystems had emerged”). Occasional elevated diction (“cryptic folds,”“conceptual repricing”) slightly overshoots keeper voice, minor −0.2. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold sentences; props track.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: single sentences layer light, child gaze, and internal pulse. Rhythm shifts from lullaby cadence to short declarative hush at totality without template monotony. One mixed metaphor—“silk prison” for baby curl—clashes with nurturing tone, minor artifact. No loops or scaffold; closing line reuses “ordinary magic” but reweights it legitimately.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with discovery—long sensuous sentences for archive work, staccato clause for the sky-crack realization. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds texture or knowledge. One mixed metaphor (“sky hung at an impossible angle”) is allowed; it doesn’t tangle causality. Final line is clean, propulsive, and recharges tapestry image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and information-dense; each image does double duty (“white finger pointing toward nowhere” localizes lighthouse and theme). Occasional poetic compression (“the current pulled”) is taught early and sustained, so it reads as voice rather than artifact. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor dull the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and auricular, but three adjacent sentences beginning “The loop pedal clicked...” create a template cadence that dulls the final third; one mixed metaphor—“threads of quiet pulling apart to reveal something brighter and more terrible than absence”—muddies the sensory logic at the hinge moment. Otherwise sentences carry dual duty and the diction stays inside Matthias’s cloistered lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence layers image and concept without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are purposeful (crystalline song, logarithmic curve of time) and stay within the POV’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to the staccato “Take up your baton.” No filter-verb clusters or scaffold; the final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density—each sentence layers time, body, and object. Figurative language is selective ("stone pulsing as if remembering") and keeps physical logic intact. No loops or scaffold; varied sentence openings propel the lyric rhythm. Meets quick test; minor poetic abstractions never obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines are dense, doubling duty: “time seemed to pool rather than pass” seeds cavern stasis and emotional stagnation. Occasional poetic compression (“the air itself felt audibly muted”) is earned by pattern. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with crank-winding and vibration surges. A single scaffold cliché—“like a tide receding from shore”—is minor. Closure sentence clean; no figurative muddle touching final image.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences fuse atmospheric detail, backstory, and stakes (“seventeen leather-bound volumes… uncharted territory”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates—latinate cadence for meditative dusk, staccato prepositional chains for evasion (“through narrow alleyways, circling the old cathedral twice”). Alliteration and assonance serve mood without purple drift. Clean copy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences layer scent, light, memory. No scaffold loops; metaphors (“lantern itself now”) are coherent and sparse. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts land on image pivots. Peak beat (“the bloom stood open…”) keeps verbs strong, avoids purple overload. Copy-clean; no tense drift or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyric but information-dense: each sentence layers physical detail and conceptual stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (starlight as thread, time as texture) and never stall momentum. One paraphrase loop (“pattern… spiral… pattern”) is forgiven because the repetition is the point. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift in the final third—clears the 9+ hygiene bar.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing: controlled caesuras, clause length variance, no scaffold loops; figurative language is sparse and coherent (“each drop a small bell struck”). High density per sentence, e.g., “skeleton of iron and stubbornness” carries setting+character+metaphor. Punctuation and sequence immaculate; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening lyrical dilation contracts to staccato final clause. Metaphors are coherent—amber, whiskey, static—each returns with shifted charge. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. High information density: “grief…meant something had mattered enough to lose” does triple duty—theme, emotion, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyrical density is purposeful and taught early; no mixed metaphors. Scaffolding limited to one explanatory clause (“she understood immediately”). High information density: net-mender grandmother, shipping-error backstory, lighthouse ritual all woven in two sentences. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized options”) barely drifts from POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet airy: “marsh-reed sculptor” carries world, occupation, and metaphor in three syllables. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse but precise—fruit of frozen quartz, lake to molten copper—never crowding the emotional beat. Final line (“spiral within spiral, leading her deeper into the web”) reuses the opening motif with reweighted meaning, achieving closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and largely loop-free; occasional adjective stacks (“suspended emptiness that seemed to hold its own weight”) verge on purple but occur outside the peak borrowing beat, so clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose sustains lyric density without purple drift: “sapphire hush,” “colonized its substance” remain exact. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Rhythm modulates from long clause (opening) to staccato final line, propelling closure. Metaphors stay coherent; only minor scaffold—“she has found…what she has always been searching for”—could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong density—most sentences advance observation and metaphor simultaneously. Occasional adjective pairs (“circuitously but sincerely”) feel editorial rather than urgent. Mixed-metaphor watch: “bruises spreading across skin” next to “slow form of dying” is saved because both map onto body/plant parallelism. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; closing cadence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from 5-word fragments to 28-word coils, tracking her flickering attention. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds temperature, texture, or spatial data. Figurative load is high but patterned—“silver threads,” “congregation of pools”—teaching the water-as-text motif early. One micro-tangle: “unearthed temple of human stubbornness” is overripe, yet it lands in a low-pressure beat so clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action: paragraph lengths contract toward the closing beat. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“salt crystals…like archival frost” is the lone image, earned. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Line density doubles duty: “he invited…she carried…he spread” advances motion while showing status shift. One clause abstraction (“exile had also created a space”) is strategic telling, not scaffold.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
    <comment>The post-exile archivist who re-visions fragments into living memory refreshes the “collector of broken pasts” trope by making the collector the future herald. Specific coastal detail—ivory harbor, salt crust, corroded brass—roots the concept in a singular place. The closing reconfiguration (silent valve → prospective voice) feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate: quiet lyric accumulation rather than twist, but executed without safety hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do double duty (action + atmosphere) without scaffold; only two near-adjacent “mist” nouns echo. Metaphors stay coherent (stars as punched velvet), rhythm modulates with discovery, and no filter-verb clusters dull immediacy. Clean enough for 9-band, minor lexical repeats keep it just shy.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often layers tool, body, memory—“grid of smaller squares, each containing a symbol she did not recognize, arranged in patterns that seemed both chaotic and deliberate.” No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line breathes after propulsive build, satisfying ear test. Clean grammar, precise punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet readable—“wounds in reality itself” performs double duty as metaphor and literal effect. Metaphors cohere within light/ magnetism field logic; no mixed vehicles trip the reader. One paraphrase loop detected (“fracturing dimensions and singing magnetic fields” echoes earlier “fractured…fields”) costs −0.2. Otherwise rhythm breathes, sentences vary, and final line lands clean, supporting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; every sentence advances character or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“eyes carrying the hollowness of someone who had outrun something terrible.” No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Opening and closing lines bookend with sensory specificity (ink pot → chrysanthemums), creating cadence symmetry. One minor filter verb cluster (“she understood finally”) keeps it from perfect 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative language is selective—each optic metaphor returns in the closure image, avoiding purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; information density remains high without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—image + emotional reverb. Minor loop: “fragments” appears nine times without new inflection late in text, dulling edge slightly. Metaphors stay coherent (tide as breath, paper as cloth). No scaffolding or register drift; clarity intact at closure. A crisper final sentence would nudge toward 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is sure; sentence openings vary, avoiding template cadence. Sentences carry double duty: “smelled of salt and sawdust” anchors both atmosphere and thematic brine of preserved memory. Metaphors are controlled—“abandoned thoughts” for loose strings—never spill into mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; information is forward-leaning. Only minor slip: “убегая от” Cyrillic echo feels self-conscious rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variation strong; alternating short declaratives with imagist fragments propels night momentum. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. Concrete verbs—“creaked,” “gleamed,” “pressed”—anchor abstractions. Metaphors organic (“floating diamonds”) and consistent across paragraph. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory cue, social cue, and symbolic plan. Copy clean; only nit is optional comma after “gifts” in penultimate sentence but rhythm still clear.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and syntactic axis; no template cadence detected. Figurative layer (“turning the surrounding silence into something almost tangible”) is sparse, taught early, and paid off in the hush-to-blaze transition. One scaffold trace: “she had traveled farther… she understood why” is mild exposition but propels motive. Otherwise lean, high-density lines.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and information-dense; most sentences do two jobs (atmosphere + tech detail). Occasional modifier stacks (“thin and endless, softening the edges”) flirt with prettiness but serve the mist motif. One paraphrase loop: “where trains once delivered… and ships sent their cargo” could compress. Otherwise rhythm, tense, and causal connectors are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence advances atlas, atmosphere, or inference. Only minor loop: “the way all things… find where they belong” abstracts what the image already shows. Metaphors are disciplined—condensation as rivers, frost as clock—never mixed. Read-aloud rhythm breathes at beats of arrival and recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences carry triple duty—advance loop, deepen texture, and echo sound patterns (“rhythm of markets, children, and funeral processions”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each repetition of “seven thousand” accrues new weight. Figurative language is disciplined: every metaphor is acoustic and testable (stone humming, fork warming). Read-aloud rhythm is propulsive yet patient, enacting the story’s method in its own syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphor stack (“silver and gold,” “songs into the void”) sustains pattern without breaking causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Occasional elevated nominalizations (“renunciation,” “ephemeral”) fit mythic tone. Final paragraph could lose one adjective (“brilliantly illuminated”) without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative density is high but patterned—copperlight, fever-sweat, reef grave—so it reads as accumulative design, not purple overload; zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors in peak beat, and final sentence cadence crystallizes without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines (“alchemical roses bloom faster in her wake”) advance both atmosphere and causality. Metaphors interlock rather than compete; no mixed vehicles in peak beat. One minor scaffold: “before the fire, before the smoke…” paraphrase could trim, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm deliberate and intact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies from breath-long iambs (“She carried…”) to clause-rich incantations (“the ancient practice of path-stitching…”) that mimic sewing motion. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early and paid off at closure; no mixed metaphors. Information density is strong: one sentence often layers geological time, personal memory, and tactile action. Minor loop risk in repeated “broken” and “reverence” leitmotifs, but the final line recharges them, avoiding artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temps: long cadences for catacomb hush, clipped clauses when bricks tumble. Metaphors are organic (roots like veins) and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“interrupted journeys…interrupted once”) but it occurs early and is soon buried by fresh detail. Closing sentence cadence rises into liturgical resonance without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety and sonic layering (“smell of concession-stand popcorn lingered beneath notes of paper and ink”) propel without purple overload. Figurative language is selective, never stacked in successive sentences. One scaffold echo: “carefully inventive” appears twice in close proximity; minor, does not touch closure. Otherwise high density, zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density—almost every sentence layers metaphor with causal information; occasional ornamental clustering (“echoed silence...voices...suppressed...buried”) barely nicks clarity, never touches the final beat, momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots rose from black water like crooked fingers” does image + atmosphere + stakes in one stroke. No synonym loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective, never clotted. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for swamp, fragment (“Come back”) for spirit message—without algorithmic pattern. One near-mix: “monument to her cowardice” skirts abstraction, but immediate tactile follow (“paper had nearly torn”) grounds it. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lyric but disciplined: “edges blurring, sounds arriving from distant shores” varies rhythm without purple overload. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds either sensory or emotional information. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“she understood”) rather than scaffolding. The closing line “ache that was lotus-hearted and ancient” risks poetic inflation but is earned by prior coral/reef imagery and carries undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathy sentences for fog, staccato for children’s laughter. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—never obscures causality. One scaffold pair: “the way joy passes… the way all genuine joy carries…” could compress. Otherwise zero loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line—“happy within the fold of a daydream”—recharges fog-as-memory motif.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; only minor loop—“seventeen years restoring murals, painting color…”—and one mixed metaphor (“like light bending through water” beside “ripple back”) keep it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “candidly cryptic, each furrow a sentence” compresses concept and sensory detail into one breath. Only one scaffold loop—“the particular warmth of someone who knew secrets worth dying for” echoed twice—slows momentum; otherwise every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent within botanical-espionage register; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned early, so density feels earned rather than purple. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: “opal glow” recurs four times; could trim one without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphors stay within sonic/lexical field, no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase loops (“silence … quiet resonance … held-breath”) dock 0.2. Rhythm is intentional; read-aloud flow works. No artifact appears in the final third, so 9+ remains open for other categories.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. High density: “antique surveyor’s chain lay coiled in her palm—her father’s most prized possession, an antique of brass links and iron tags that had measured countless flood control channels across three generations” performs four jobs in one breath. Metaphors are geologically consistent: “floodgate engineer’s eyes,” “magma chamber’s slow convection.” Final line avoids uplift cliché, ends on tactile “measured link” cadence that echoes opening chain coil.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. High density: “meteorite chip nested inside 1962 correspondences” compresses time, object, and backstory in nine words. Rhythm modulates—catalogue-like listing of sonic traces gives way to the breathless em-dash cadence of the final realization. No mixed metaphors; crystalline formations remain consistent physical logic through to the transducer payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths swell and contract with emotional temperature. Information density high—each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed metaphor (“diagram drawn in the new weather”) is minor. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; wood grain analysis is concrete, not abstract. Peak beat—the step off the terrace—uses spare, unadorned diction that lets the cost land.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm modulates naturally; sentences avoid template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“fever dream,” “cathedral breath”) so closure glow feels earned, not sudden purple. Zero paraphrase loops; pronouns clean. Only minor hedge—“something within still pulsed”—could be trimmed, but它不损害propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: each sentence layers image, emotion, and world rule without scaffolding. Metaphors extend naturally (“map drawn in water”) and never collide. Rhythm modulates—long breathing cadences for intake, clipped fragments for the blackout—propelling the transliteration beat. Zero loops, zero register drift; only the faintest repeater “path” is earned by thematic necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling without scaffolding. One paraphrase loop noted above; otherwise no synonym churn or mixed metaphor. Opening and closing lines bookend with stellar imagery that recharges the motif. Density stays high—every clause advances character, texture, or concept.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Figurative density high but patterned; moon-tide metaphors repay at closure. One scaffold: “three years since…” sentence triplet could compress. No mixed vehicles; “salt in rain” dissolve is precise. Final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for stillness, clipped fragments for engine intrusion. Figurative language is selective, never piled in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“each one distinct, each one connected”) but it serves pattern, not clutter; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, selective, and paid off—“slow dance of celestial bodies” returns as witness to vigil. Information density is high: each sentence advances memory, object handling, or thematic reweighting. Opening and closing lines bookend with mirror and box, creating sonic echo without repetition. Zero grammar or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid, with rhythmic paragraph variety and strong verbs (“filtered,” “tracked,” “revitalize”). Two paraphrase loops (“patient work... patient observation”; “understanding of human potential and emotional possibility”) and one filter-verb cluster (“she understood that... she recognized that... she understood that”) dull propulsion. Figurative language stays coherent; no mixed metaphors obstruct closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “leaves pressing against shattered windows like curious animals” performs atmosphere and stakes in one stroke. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, character, or pressure. Figurative language is spare and tested—mixed metaphors are avoided even when science and mysticism intertwine.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is lush yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion: “water droplets clung… fracturing into brief rainbows” fuses verb, object, consequence in one breath. No paraphrase loops; when rainbows reappear they carry new symbolic weight. Figurative language stays internally coherent—mirrors as seeds, dawn as coaxer—never mixed. Minor scaffold in “the borrowed heartbeat pulsed steadily—a rhythm not her own” where em-dash restates known fact, but it lands early and does not blur the climactic departure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose shows high density—”sun bled into night” does triple duty: time-pass, mood, foreshadow. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stake or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent (”geometry of grief” sustains the spatial/architectural motif). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Minor hairline: “slow dance of celestial bodies” is the only phrase approaching stock, but its immediate particularization keeps the line-level fault beneath measurable penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythms vary from long, salt-flat panoramic shots to clipped release beats. Information density is high: one sentence gives us container, continent count, insulation, synthetic warmth, extinction status. Figurative language is precise—“map beneath her boots was drawn by cracks”—and never competes with itself. Only a single adjectival stack (“manufactured drought in neighboring regions”) feels administratively dense; it passes because drought is literally manufactured by administration.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence-level propulsion is high; metaphor density is purposeful and patterned, not gratuitous. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction (“inviolate,” “resignation”) fits the POV’s poetic self-training. One mixed image—“threads…wrapped around frozen water”—is momentarily physical nonsense but does not touch the closure beat, so keeps the 9− band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence variety strong. Figurative language is dense (>60% of sentences) yet patterned and purposeful, avoiding artifact cap. One mixed metaphor—“architectural husk and the strange acoustics that made every sound feel like it was being whispered from very far away”—slightly blurs physics, but does not touch closure. Zero loops or scaffold; information density high.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythmic variety supports breath and urgency; figurative density stays under 25% in crisis beats, avoiding muddle. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“cadence,” “taxonomy”) slightly exceeds rugged field-worker lexicon, but consistency and payoff in closure waive higher penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long braided clauses to short declarative punches, propelling the night’s work. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“silence pooled like water frozen mid-collapse”) and never overruns the tactile beats. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. A single filter verb cluster (“seemed to mock”) is voice-motivated and paid off by the literal color shift at dawn, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—concrete, pulse, seal, storm packed into single beats. No loops, no scaffold; figuratives are spare and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates with wind, then crystallizes in sourceless glow. Minor template echo: “this very…” triad, but it serves mantra cadence and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; high density—“palace where he had served three kings now stood in uncertain twilight” does three jobs in one line. Metaphors stay coherent: twilight as political & literal, resonance as sound & contract. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating circular propulsion. One hairline slip: “footsteps” in Chinese characters jars momentarily, but context teaches the alienation effect, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean: no filler verbs, no adjectival stacks. Figurative language is spare—three metaphors total—and each pays off (“architecture of bitterness” resurfaces as “cage we build”). One paraphrase loop: “refuse to fight… refuse to force… refuse to raise” is intentional parallelism that enacts pacifism, not slack. Sentence variety is organic; no template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry dual duty—image and concept—without scaffold; only minor loop occurs (“boundary…erasing boundaries”). Metaphors stay coherent within fog-glass membrane logic. Strong read-aloud rhythm and precise noun choice; no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or emotional newness. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles (stars in pears, cathedral as orchard) stay coherent. Minor register lift—“recrimination and silence,” “conceptual repricing”—but diction remains within a craftswoman’s lexicon. Final ribbon line lands clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse but precise (“time moved like honey through a sieve”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. Rhythm varies from languid reflective rolls to the sharp one-sentence whisper that triggers closure. Opening and closing lines are image-based, propulsive, and free of boilerplate.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences vary in length and clause structure, sustaining an incantatory ear. Metaphors mostly cohere (“quiet vibration of accumulated words”) though one mixed vein (“cracks spreading through ice” beside “unheard symphony”) slightly jars. Occasional scaffolding—“she understood now,” “she realized”—recaps what prose has already shown. No loops or typo issues; overall density is high and propulsive, with only minor register drift into abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and largely loop-free; figurative language is disciplined, no mixed metaphors. A few echoing stems (“shared memories,” “shared history”) create low-level scaffold, not severe enough to dull closure. Information density is high; sentences advance atmosphere and premise simultaneously. Minor over-decoration in adjectives (“abandoned joy,” “phantom passengers”) keeps it below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “cathedral of iron and wood”, “slow communion with smaller gears” compress scale and ritual in one stroke. Occasional elevated register (“eloquent absence”, “conceptual repricing”) skirts purple but stays motivated by Elena’s cataloguing intellect; no loops or mixed metaphors, rhythm shifts cleanly with discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences do double duty—e.g., “crack patterns spread like frost…each fracture telling the story” fuses image, backstory, and tension. Zero loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; high-density without purple overload. Closure line is clean, luminous, unforced.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; most sentences dual-load atmosphere + exposition. Occasional modifier stacks (“lullaby of frequencies that the old engineers had somehow encoded”) verge on purple but stay within POV lexicon. One paraphrase loop in final paragraph; no mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Closure line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; rhythm echoes storm cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned, taught early, and paid off in final lightning hush. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density high—each line advances image or concept.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm swings from processional cadence to spark-quick fragments at the light-off. Figurative density is high but patterned—fire as question mark, hand, hope—teaching the reader early and paying off in final spiral. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One micro-scaffold: “the flame caught, catching, catching hold” could drop one “catching,” but the triplet is voice-motivated and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: one job per sentence, no scaffold loops, strong verbs (“carved,” “shimmered,” “crystallized”). Figurative layer is dense yet patterned—every water image pays into final “tide was turning,” so density is earned. One mixed vehicle: “silence stretched…like surface of a pool” is generic, but it sits early and doesn’t recur. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long accumulation to single-clause finale; no monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, high-density; most sentences perform two jobs (advance + image). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphor check: “gilded hush” and “silence like sleeping sheep” coexist without contradiction. One filter-verb cluster (“she realized that limitation could mean something else”) is strategically placed at the insight beat and does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm accelerates with the vapor release and humming, then exhales into the crystalline final sentence. Figurative language is sparse but precise: “hush vault upward around her like a cathedral ceiling” is the single extended metaphor and it pays off at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances setting, pressure, or image. Copy is clean; only one adverb (“softly”) and it’s earned.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush yet selective; no synonym loops or scaffold sentences. Mixed metaphors avoided—“crystallized light,” “fossilized colours” stay within material science register. One clause contains Chinese characters “炽热” instead of English “hot”; while comprehensible, it jolts the lexicon and knocks 0.2. Otherwise rhythm breathes with beats, information density high, and final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from measured cataloguing of ash layers to the short release of “She did not resist.” Figurative density is high but patterned—bridge, burn, breath—teaching the reader early. One scaffold pair (“she had learned that love could suffocate…”) is strategic summary, not loop. No mixed metaphors; bruise-colored brass and gasping double remain coherent. Final line lands with propulsive snap.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and musical—information duplexes without scaffold: “pressure tasted like anticipation and copper.” No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; metaphor vehicles respect physical logic. Rhythm breathes with beats, accelerates at bolt-translucence. One register spike: “Conceptual Repricing” feels academic against visceral imagery, but it appears only in final clause and does not blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from elegiac cadence to staccato click of the crank. Figurative density is high but patterned early, so it reads as conscious texture rather than spillover. No paraphrase loops; pronouns track cleanly. One mixed metaphor—“shadows like arms of ghosts reaching”—barely blurs clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences do multiple jobs (“The factually mystical quality… seemed to have imbued them…”) though occasional modifier stacks (“phosphorescent luminescence”) verge on pleonasm; no loops or mixed metaphors obstruct the final image. Clean mechanics support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“compass needle pointing toward a story”—no mixed metaphors. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts clean. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences fold archival sabotage into taxonomy, grandmother lineage into key history. Figurative control tight: no mixed metaphors, no purple. One paraphrase loop—“regime had tried to drain it twice… lagoon had reappear each time”—but the repetition enforces stubbornness motif, so waived. Sentence rhythm varies from curt archival listings to liquid lagoon longues. Zero typos, zero simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: varied cadence, strategic anaphora, no scaffold loops.  Figurative density is high but motif-consistent; no mixed metaphors.  Occasional adjective stacks (“quietly vivid ribbons”) flirt with purple but serve prismatic effect without tripping causality.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm musical, sentence openings varied. Occasional poetic overwriting—three consecutive adjective stacks in “ashen skyborne arbor that circled the world’s highest ridge”—but density never stalls momentum. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent (leaves as fingers) although “mossy delight” is idiosyncratic. Clean grammar, pronouns anchored, no scaffold artifacts in closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong verbs, concrete nouns, almost no scaffolding; rhythm modulates with descent. One minor echo: “neglected greenhouse” twice in three lines. Otherwise lean and propulsive; metaphors consistent (rust = dried blood) and apt for POV. Line-level craft solid.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances forge action or refracts memory. Figurative language is sparse, enacted (“the brass pans collecting rainwater instead of rare earths”) rather than ornamental. No mixed metaphors; liquid-gold-as-honey is single, sustained vehicle. Rhythm modulates from rain percussion to forge roar to final hush, carrying momentum to the last line without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “hush of a hidden sunrise bled through the stone walls in threads of amber light” does three jobs—time, place, mood—in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles (sound as tear-music, gorge as wound) stay consistent. One minor scaffold—“she had encountered him before, many times”—could trim to “she had met him here before,” but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density, minimal scaffold; repeated “mathematics” is intentional motif. Opening/closure sentences echo without loop. Every clause advances knowledge, atmosphere, or beat. Metaphors stay consistent (UV light as liquid). Minor synonym adjacency (“treescape… forest… treescape”) is loomed into pattern so excused.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from reflective cadence to crystalline closure without scaffold. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—each beam or corridor image advances the translator metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing sentences book-end with “elusively tangible,” now redefined, showing patterned control without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentences layered with dust physics, POV bias, and foreshadowing. Figurative control: metaphors (frozen lightning, scratched record) are clean, non-contradictory, and pattern-taught early. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythms vary. Minor alliteration is voice-motivated, not ostentatious.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory image, world-rule, emotional charge (“the glass orchard shuddered as the frost patterns shattered”). Metaphors are kept rare enough to avoid purple drift; when they appear (“dreaming whales”) they are brief and apt. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances either knowledge or atmosphere. A single mixed moment—“rupture came not with sound but with expansion”—slightly muddles sensory logic, a hairline slip keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety strong; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“amber honey,” “polished stone”), paying off in closure reprise. One mixed-metaphor risk—“footsteps leaving temporary impressions in…honey”—barely perceptible. High information density; each sentence layers image + world rule + emotional state. Clean copy; pronoun and tense immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong information density; most sentences dual-purpose (action + atmosphere). Figurative runs frequent but pattern-taught early (“patience of centuries,” “dust seemed to shrink”) and paid off in final bloom image—no closure obscurity. One paraphrase loop: “silent since the theft, its pipes empty of breath, its bellows collapsed like sleeping animals” triples silence without additive pressure → −0.2. Otherwise clean mechanics, no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“industry has exhaled its last” performs double duty for sound and meaning. Information density is high; each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or action. Line-level craft is exemplary under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “salt and current shaped every twisted branch” performs characterization, setting, and theme in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language clusters only in calmer beats. Final third remains clean—“each motion a prayer, each curve an invitation”—so 9-band stays intact. Occasional alliteration (“turbine-hum reverie”) is pattern-taught and modulated.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is supple and image-dense, yet three adjacent sentences open with “The…” in the first paragraph; minor template cadence. Mixed metaphor cluster—“lagoon as doorway,” “insect in amber,” “patient whale”—lands safely because each serves a discrete beat, but edges toward ornament. Zero paraphrase loops; information density is high. No artifacts touch the closing image; momentum stays fluid.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence either advances memory-infusion or re-images the cove. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“lanterns swaying above crystal waters” anchors literal past before shift to figurative rebirth. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “amber light.” Information density high: “bottle could not be opened because its contents were not meant to escape—they were meant to be expanded” fuses world-rule, theme, and tension in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from measured opening to breathless accumulation without template cadence. Figurative layer (“amber light through a window left ajar”) is controlled to one per beat, avoiding overwrite penalty. One scaffold paraphrase loop (“backward through…backward through…”) is minor and thematically apt, not obscuring closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: every sentence performs double duty—moves action and re-casts atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent (entropy as yarn, time as river) and never mixed; physical logic holds. Rhythm mirrors ritual cadence without drumbeat monotony; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts land on pressure points. A single paraphrase loop (“time that had been gifted … time that had been gifted”) is minor enough to leave 9-band eligibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; information density high—each line advances sensor data or memory. Only minor loop: “windblown sanctuary above the clouds” appears twice within 60 words; does not touch closure, so −0.2, still within high band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative strings serve the accumulative design. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“generations of janitors who had all understood something essential”) momentarily lifts the register above the focalizer’s plain curiosity, but not at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: each metaphor (ribs, moth wings, amber pools) returns in the box image, preventing decorative sprawl. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed vehicle—“weight…pressing against her ribs” alongside “impossible lightness”—knocks 0.2, but clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm modulates naturally; sentences avoid template cadence. Occasional stacked modifiers—“emerald and eternal, holding its broken treasures”—stop short of purple; no loops or scaffold obscure causality. High information density; each sentence advances atmosphere or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pressure: longer clauses in calm observation, shorter fragments at splash and flight. Information density high—each sentence layers tactile detail and thematic resonance without scaffolding. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse enough to keep peak beats clear; when it appears (“small scattered suns”) it sharpens rather than obscures. Copy-clean; punctuation supports cadence.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>The kingfisher-feather-kite nexus feels fresh because repair is aimed at gesture, not function, and because the missing string is embraced as aperture rather than flaw. Synthesis of lyric essay with tactile object narrative is non-obvious yet coherent. Risk—letting the climax be a refusal to finish—heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Could edge higher if the poet’s personal history with broken things were hinted more particularly, but within 740 words the particularity of handling is memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening strategy; rhythm breathes with the ladder climb then settles into the hush of the final line. Figurative language is spare and grounded—“geological formation,” “vine tendrils”—never overwrought. One paraphrase loop (“she had inherited… from her mother, who had inherited…”) costs −0.2, but it sits mid-story and does not touch closure. Otherwise, high density and propulsion maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with reflection: longer cognitive loops contract into short final clauses (“converging toward understanding”). Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—but pattern is set early and sustained, so allowed. No mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality; scaffolding minimal. Occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous capacity for wonder”) slightly overshoots character lexicon, nudging deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs. Figurative density is high but patterned (reef = beast ribs, pods = arguments) and charges closure. One mixed metaphor (“submerged concord of treaty between life and death”) is forgiven because the phrase is re-prised and re-defined by the green thread. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; information density strong.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, image-dense, largely free of loops; only one scaffold-like lapse (“wasteland…wasteland” in adjacent clauses) and no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph cuts are clean. Filter verbs minimal; strong sensory nouns/verbs dominate. Final line lands with imagistic snap, satisfying the read-aloud test.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “heartbeat of a thousand calculations” collapses an era into one clause. Metaphors stay coherent—compass rose, blade of light, stretched fabric—without self-contradiction. No looped stems or synonym churn; each sentence advances stance or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density—each sentence advances image or backstory without scaffold. Occasional adjective pairs (“sacredly playful wonder”) verge on formula but appear outside the climax and do not obscure causality. Rhythm modulates between long atmospheric clauses and crisp dialogue beats.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: long anaphoric clauses build, then fracture in the final short beat. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“nomadic penumbra”) is earned by reflective distance; it never clutters the high-pressure final line.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong information density; most sentences double-duty. One paraphrase loop (“lost language… language of her ancestors”) costs −0.2. Mixed metaphors absent; rhythm varies, paragraph cuts clean. No scaffold or filter stacks. Figurative language is sparse under peak beat, avoiding purple. Minor loop keeps it sub-9; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence music is deliberate: parallel “always twisting, always arranging” enacts the fidget habit; clause elongation mirrors frozen duration. No loops, no scaffold, high density—every line advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (labyrinth = sky-reflecting board; tapestry = narrative board). Minor overwriting in “suspended spell” and “gleaming coils” but these are pattern-taught early and recur with payoff. Proofing clean; punctuation wielded for rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often paints atmosphere, advances plot, and reveals character. Figurative language is selective, never clustering in high-pressure beats. Minor filter-verb hiccup—“seemed to lean in”—but immediacy recovers. Clause variety and paragraph breath control propel the accumulative arc without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description fused with interior motion (“she pressed the charm… tasting copper of old blood”). No loops or scaffold; occasional adjective pairs (“drowning light,” “tarnished key”) stay purposeful. Metaphors are coherent under aquatic pressure imagery. One clause drifts toward abstraction (“rearranging chaos rather than creating meaning”) but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary to match cavern echoes and interior hush. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—light “hiding,” cave as “cathedral”—and avoids mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“illusion of surrender…exhausting pretense of choice”) costs −0.2. No scaffolding or synonym churn in final third; closure sentence is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“salt-worn granite beneath her fingers” does sensory and character work in one stroke. Mixed metaphor risk in “wounded stars” but saved by consistent light/sound duality. Cadence shifts mirror thermal pressure → cool release. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors, not exposition. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the single drop of night carry the reverb.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines are dense and propulsive; figurative language is controlled, not stacked. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“patient architecture of persistence”) fits reflective beat without register drift. Opening and closing images bookend cleanly; punctuation clean.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but rarely overwrought; figurative language clusters in descriptive openings, then thins during action beats to avoid clutter. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor risk: “memories settling…like tide marks on stone” joins geologic and oceanic vehicles, yet the confluence is brief and doesn’t recur. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with paragraph breaks timed to lens-sweep and revelation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences lengthen during descent, then fragment as water rises. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“oily to the touch,” “bloom held its breath”—never muddling causality. Micro-loop check clean: no paraphrase stacks, no template cadence. Opening and closing lines bookend with image-propulsion, satisfying 9− prose craft.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety is supple, with strategic fragments (“The climb grew steeper…”) that mimic breath thinning. Occasional metaphor crowding (“cape made of spiderwebs and threat”) slightly overdresses the moment but never obscures causality or dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density—figurative language carries double duty (science + emotion). One paraphrase loop (“return to this nexus again and again”) and occasional elevated register (“logarithmic curves guided her research”) nudge beneath flawless, but clarity never breaks and no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long narcotic sentences for dream-drunk passages, staccato fragments at jealous climax. Metaphors stay internally coherent (lighthouse illuminating rocks, Möbius strip of recursive meaning). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Only minor overworld in one descriptive stack keeps this below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective: “fog pressed like something wanting in” serves mood without clutter. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “her tears… became small diamonds” fuses bodily change and metaphor in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each repetition (“held breath”) gains new semantic weight. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Metaphors stay physically coherent—rain dissolving crystals mirrors internal release—without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative layering is dense but patterned, never clogging the final image; “chainsaws cough” and “loosened strings” are precise, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is high: information-dense sentences perform double duty (“her footsteps made no sound upon stones that predated light itself”). Figurative language is coherent—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm modulates with long breathy clauses. A few slight abstractions (“consciousness expanding as her body contracted”) could be sharper, but they do not stall momentum. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift appear; prose propels despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense: “water seeking its level, always seeking its level” uses repetition to enact the very cycle described. Metaphors (razor, knife-edge, texture of quiet) stay coherent and physical. Occasional elevated phrasing—“revelation that came only after long patience”—is earned by voice. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles; paragraphing breathes with the hydraulic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like the fungi: long luminescent sentences swell, then contract into the terse “You’re leaving.” No loops or scaffold; every image does double duty (“luminous and permeable” marries light and emotion). One near-muddle: “revolution through permeable barriers” is repeated twice in close succession—minor paraphrase sting, not closure-touching. Otherwise high-density, zero filler.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyric density is high but patterned—rain, paper, sodium, mica—so repetition feels purposeful. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“clover melancholy,” “addition of losses that might yet become multiplication”) flirts with purple yet supports voice. Closure line is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is tidal, sentence lengths ebbing and surring like tunnel airflow. No scaffold loops; information density high—each sentence layers job mythology + sensory cue + emotional corollary. Metaphors stay consistent (tunnel as artery, grief as frequency) without mixed vehicles. Minor adjective drift (“impossible light,” “threshold hour”) but diction stays within Mira’s poetic technician range. Closure line is pristine monosyllable: “The phone rang.”

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates gracefully; only two adjacent paraphrase loops (“gently thorough” echoed in adjacent clauses) cost −0.2. Metaphors cohere under photo/tea axis; no mixed vehicles. High information density: sensory, archival, familial data packed without scaffold. Closure image clean of artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density—single sentences layer backstory, tone, and stakes. Occasional soft adverbials (“precisely,” “improbably”) and one stacked appositive could tighten, but no loops or mixed metaphors obscure causality. Rhythm modulates with emotional crest; final echo line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    High figurative density is patterned and justified—liquid metaphors for sound, mineral for memory—no mixed vehicles; occasional echoing stems (“each ring a year, each year a story”) verge on template cadence but occur early and serve incantatory build-up; closure image remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: every sentence advances character, image, or concept; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and taught early—“origami made of radio waves”—then pays off at closure. Rhythm modulates with attention: patient accumulation mirrors the unbending process. Minor over-modulation in “strange comfort settled over her like a familiar blanket…” but it lands the emotional beat without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density: each sentence advances premise or image. Few near-loops (“knowledge…knowledge”) but phrasing generally varied. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “she realized…she understood” summary pair; doesn’t touch closure. Clean grammar, precise spatial choreography inside chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with different structures, no template cadence. Information density high—single clauses manage sensory, emotional, and world data. One mixed-metaphor risk: “vomiting stars” is tolerated because it encodes both nausea and cosmic scale within Elara’s altered perception. Zero loops or filler.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary from muscular (“She unfolded her maps on a crate…”) to lyric (“light pooled in unexpected corridors”) without purple drift. Zero loops, zero scaffold; each clause adds sensory or causal data. Metaphors (mycelium, sea-goat) are sparse, taught early, paid off. Final paragraph cadence slows to match dawn-after calm—rhythm engineers emotion without announcing it.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence is controlled: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Metaphors are coherent—“patient circle returning to center” extends water imagery. No mixed metaphors or conflicting vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, memory, and tactical intent. Minor scaffold: “she had learned” repeats twice in opening paragraph; second instance could trim. No synonym churn; “spiralingly” coinage is justified by voice. Closure line “stars that had learned to wait” is crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is fluid, musical, largely loop-free; sentences advance image or stake. A few soft repeats—“quiet rebellion,” “cradle” used thrice—slightly dull momentum. Metaphors stay coherent within the hush/ magnet motif. No scaffolding or artifact obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes in one sinuous sweep; final line recharges motif without exposition. Strong verbs (“carved,” “breathed,” “swelled”) replace modifiers. One micro-slip: “surrender” used twice in close proximity, but second instance is thematic payoff, not churn. Read-aloud rhythm undulates like tide, accelerating into the swim.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences propel: each whittling line does triple duty—reveals process, escalates risk, textures grief. No synonym loops; “turbines” re-named only once (“towering white forms”) for variety without churn. Metaphors are clean and consistent (curl = falling thought, hush = remade silence). Paragraph cuts are purposeful; removing any would delete stage-direction timing. Opening and closing lines bookend with mirror cadence, satisfying read-aloud ear. One minor scaffold: two consecutive sentences beginning “The turbine hum…” could merge, but it does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; stacked metaphors (cobalt light, fractured glass, lantern-moth hush) verge on density but serve the accumulative design. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. One paraphrase loop: “what was sacred is becoming...” triple repetition is purposeful chant, not artifact. Closure sentence is clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences open with participles only when action is simultaneous. High density: “colors that had bled together in ways he hadn’t intended” does double duty—world rule + foreshadowing Mira’s sight. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. One mixed metaphor: “understanding blooming across his features like the first color a colorblind person might ever truly perceive” – “blooming” + vision metaphor slightly muddled but occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so −0.2. Otherwise clean propulsion to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—information plus atmosphere—without figurative pile-up; only one mixed metaphor (“liquid courage” for light) momentarily wobbles. Loops are absent, propulsion steady; the final line lands clean, recharging “golden shadows” without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: caesura in starlight sentences, staccato on descent. Information density high—“gossamer barriers between what was and what could be” does triple metaphorical duty. One paraphrase loop: “hollowed out and scattered like crushed pearls” / “rock bottom and found the bottom had no floor” conceptually echo; distance keeps it from artifact. Closure image clean, no mixed metaphor; pendant’s withered flower is precise, unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud ear shows rhythmic variation: rain percussion against soft refracted light, then the hush of card shuffle. Figurative language is rationed—only two metaphors in final beat, both earned. No filter-verb stacks; information density high (“cryptocurrency crashes had obliterated fortunes and shuttered startups” does triple duty). One paraphrase loop: “inherited mystery of generations of cartomancers” echoed twice within three lines—minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence length; occasional modifier stacks ("luminescent dust motes caught in a draft") verge on purple but serve the ecstatic mode. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor edge ("hollow shell of some great creature") does not dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet aerated—concrete nouns (“dream-frames,” “luminous threads”) carry metaphor without sludge. No synonym loops; each return to “softly deliberate” is intentional recurrence, not churn. One mixed vehicle: “hope accumulated in corners” (corners in a sky-library?) momentarily snags spatial logic, but the metaphor is brief and does not recur at closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes, accelerating slightly as stone warms, then settling into final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors (“mist like breath from sleeping giants”) are sparse, taught early, and reappear only in closure where starlight recharges them. Information density high: single sentences deliver sensory data, interior tilt, and plot advance. Final paragraph avoids scaffold; each clause adds new weight or image.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—action + atmosphere—without scaffold: “frost slowly migrate across the surface as the sand began its descent.” Metaphors are clean, mixed only once (“puzzle piece she had been holding upside down”). Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Minor elevation in register on “conceptual repricing of grief” is earned by context. Closure image is uncluttered and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “unused love vibrating” is kept consistent through sonic/tactile extensions. Density is high: “words…woven into the very air” performs scene work while staying sense-bound. Final line cadence mirrors the hush it names, earning poetic closure without purple inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong read-aloud cadence with purposeful variation. Occasional stacked modifiers (“shadowed rapture of the aurora-lit archway”) flirt with density but support tone. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors remain coherent within celestial field.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and imagistic; sentences multi-task (worldbuild + move body + charge metaphor) with minimal scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“broken lullaby finally learning to mend itself”) is earned by prior moss-light pattern. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no drumbeat cadence. Opening and closing lines carry precise sonic weight without purple inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Varied sentence rhythm, high information density, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is dense but patterned (musical/ metallurgical) and taught early, so payoff justifies presence. One clause (“questions themselves had grown teeth and memory”) verges on overgrowth yet fits the POV. Clean copy; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates elegantly; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent—leash as shed skin, twilight as held breath—with no mixed vehicles. One minor scaffold: “the path to courage could never be a straight line” is tell-statement amid strong show; trims easily. Otherwise high density, clear propulsion, zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: sentences carry triple duty (image, metaphor, emotional calculus). One scaffold loop—“unpardonable silence” repeated with minor rephrasing—dulls the peak beat slightly. Otherwise rhythm varies, metaphors cohere, and the final clause sings without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; metaphors (dust motes like memories, marble softening into curves) align with entropy theme and do not clog causality. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“constellations pause in their eternal dance”—is allowable poetic license. Final line earns its cadence and recharges “graceful collapse” without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose breathes—varied sentence lengths, concrete nouns, minimal scaffolding. Occasional elevated cadence (“margin of daylight where everything felt possible”) risks slight purple, but pattern is taught early and pays off in final “margin of daylight” reprise. No loop clusters or mixed metaphors obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with beats: dense lyrical stacking in plant-chorus paragraph, then clipped motion once decision forms. No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or sensory pressure. Metaphors stay sensory-grounded (plants “scream” as temperature spikes) and internally consistent. Proofing clean; punctuation around em-dash dialogue tags is standard.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm to mimic pulse; paragraph cuts land on image, never filler. Figurative language is sparse, plant-precise: “salt-crusted and forgotten” vs. stacked metaphors. Zero template cadence; no synonym loops. Only micro-slip: “the shape of what remained” is slightly abstract valediction, but occurs mid-passage, not at closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer sense and image without paraphrase loops. Metaphors are painter-appropriate and internally consistent (watercolors bleeding, threads of light). One mixed metaphor cluster: “the velvet interior exposed like an wound”—article clash and mixed vehicle—but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences contract to shorter percussive ones as walls “contract,” then expand again on emergence, supporting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is textured yet propulsive; figurative density stays controlled, taught early (“wind-carved… persistent breeze”) and paid off. No paraphrase loops; sentences vary in length and opening. Minor scaffold: “three days ago… would consume three days more” echoes rather than advances. Otherwise clean, vivid, and rhythmically alive.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence shapes, high density. No loops or scaffold. Figurative control mostly clean; “small apocalypse demolishing mythology” is vivid but stacked. Closure sentence lands cleanly. Minor: filter verb cluster (“seemed to muffle”) could trim.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“quiet like water finding its level” survives the mixed-metaphor test. One minor scaffold—“the way the light fell… the particular slant of a rose’s stem”—repeats syntactic opening, but the pattern is taught early and pays off in closure, keeping the penalty sub-deductive.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm naturally varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. High information density: single sentences deliver spike lineage, storm aftermath, and mystical premise. Metaphors are coherent—“boundary torn like wet paper” keeps tactile logic. Zero filter-verb stacks; no scaffolding. Opening and final lines act as resonance plates, anchoring and recharging motif.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence carries sensory, emotional, and genealogical data without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“clouds like gray whales” and “lens focusing” occupy separate beats, preventing collision. Rhythm modulates from long reflective cadences to staccato revelation. Zero paraphrase loops or filler filters. Copy is clean; pronouns stable. Opening and final lines both activate stakes and reconfigure meaning, respectively.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes—long sentences for wonder, clipped fragments when firmware awakens. No loops or mixed metaphors; “constellation tattoos catching the amber light” repeats once but serves as structural echo. High information density; every clause advances image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates with pressure; figurative language is selective, never clotted. Sentences carry double duty (“mist curled upward like something trying to remember”). No synonym loops or template cadences. Closing sentence earns its lift without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The patterns spoke in the tongue of the old builders” fuses sensory, historical, and spiritual data in one stroke. Figurative density is high but patterned early, so the final “ember that could warm without burning” feels earned, not piled on. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; scaffolding is minimal. A single participle opener—“Feeling its weight settle into her palm like a verdict”—is sequential and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Occasional lyrical stacking (“fractally precise display that defied random formation”) edges toward density but stops short of purple. No loops or scaffold; pronouns are clean. Tight concision throughout, with only minor figurative surplus in the middle beat preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Almost every sentence carries dual duty—sensory data + emotional decoding—without scaffold. Metaphors are controlled; only “a living map指引她前行” shows bilingual flourish, but it is purposeful. No loops or mixed vehicles; final image is crisp, propelling the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: world-build, escalate, and echo motif—“buttons that held a mother’s last gift” layers emotion and theme in one breath. Figurative control is tight: canyon echo as “between memory and possibility” is exact. Minor scaffold: “she could sense…she could feel” repeats the conditional frame. No mixed metaphors, no loops in the closure beat; the prose sings.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; no template cadence. Every paragraph advances knowledge or tension; no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (mist as shroud, wind tongues) stay internally consistent. Information density high: snow-code mechanics, bodily memory, conspiracy stakes in one beat. Closure image unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary and cut cleanly. Occasional abstract latinate stacks (“conceptual repricing”) feel slightly above coachman lexis, but brief. No loops or scaffold; information dense. Metaphors stay coherent; one mixed ghost (“palimpsest whose original words had been scraped”) is forgivable and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “luminous harbor,” “红色叹息” supply sensory punch without purple drift. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or setting. Metaphors (moon as silver/blue paint, oars as paternal heartbeat) stay coherent and physically aligned. Only hairline slip: “instill it into those dark corners” flirts with therapeutic register, but immediate tactile burial of cutting rescues immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Figurative layering is dense but purposeful, pattern-taught early (“water carried no salt, only knowledge”). No mixed metaphors; clauses stay clean, propulsion high. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) is marginally above POV vernacular, but the grandiloquence fits a 300-year librarian speaking of cosmic memory.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Metaphors are coherent—“white prayer,” “vault of her memory”—and never stacked in crisis. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Information density high: each sentence advances image, memory, or decision. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong sentence variation and density; occasional abstract qualifiers (“very, very old”) dilute urgency rather than sharpen. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent (fever, seeds, skeleton) without mixed collisions. One paraphrase loop: “interfering with the interference.” No scaffolding obscures causality, but peak beat could slice two adjectives for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“clawed,” “fold,” “pulse”). Occasional modifier stacks (“impossible geometry,” “crystallized silence”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; one instance of near-paraphrase—“personal affront” / “weight of stone and soil”—drops it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; metaphor density peaks only in meditative beats and pays off in final portrait image. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. One mixed metaphor cluster “furrows of light and shadow” borders overwrite but ties to quarry geology, forgiven. Grammar and sequence immaculate; pronoun tracking flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density: one sentence often layers external action, interior tilt, and world fact. Occasional lyrical inflation (“voice emerging from the grave with the spongey dread”) risks purple, but pattern is set early and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates into final stride. Minor paraphrase echo around “exile” terminology costs precision.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory anchoring, metaphoric payload, and causal seed (“worn leather split at the corners” seeds later shard’s razor edge). One paraphrase loop—“the particular silence... the silence that fell”—is forgivable at 750-word density. Figurative layer is rich yet consistent (photography, music, cartography) and never muddies the tunnel-to-flake causality. Opening and closing lines read aloud with satisfying cadential snap.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: “shoebox of foreign paper money and a philosophy” compresses backstory and stakes. Mixed metaphor check: “rusted…whispering” + “iron skin” remain coherent. No paraphrase loops; sentences advance distinct knowledge. Paragraph cuts purposeful: single-line “So what do we do instead?” isolates shift. Minor cadence echo “markers…markers” is pattern-taught and paid off, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; figuratives are patterned (stars as language) and repay at closure. No loops, no mixed metaphors, clean grammar. Two adjacent “she realized / she understood” create mild echo but don’t stall beat. Density stays high—each sentence layers time, memory, and star data simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with the vortex: longer sentences for swirl, clipped fragments at crack. Metaphors stay physically coherent—ice as confession, rainbow shards as fragmented pride. One scaffold loop: “finding was not the same as fixing / finding the wound did not heal it” could compress. Otherwise density high; nouns concrete, verbs strong, no thesaurus drift.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density figurative layering remains coherent—no mixed metaphors—while rhythm accelerates into fragmentary bursts at transcendence; occasional adjective richness is justified by visionary POV; zero paraphrase loops, clean prop tracking, no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; strong verbs (“snaked,” “warped,” “hollowed”) minimize adjectives. Figurative layers serve thematic density without clutter; no mixed metaphors or template cadence. Only micro-loop: “fiercely gentle” repeated; not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; quarry wind sentence stretches to mimic loneliness. No synonym loops; “confident uncertainty” is the only repeated stem and it is motif-driven. Metaphors stay coherent—echo valley, sound-dampening—none mixed. High information density: one sentence can deliver sense memory, fiscal fact, and emotional insulation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; metaphor density is high but patterned and paid off (“seed…woven from starlight” returns as “pages…woven from starlight”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences do double duty—description advances theme. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by resonant image. One near-strain—“tree rose like a spine”—but spine-as-upright works and recurs in “perpetual becoming,” so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm undulates like water: long anaphoric clauses followed by terse prepositional fragments that mimic tide pull. Figurative language is dense but coherent—metals flow like quicksilver, identities like salmon—without mixed vehicles. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence adds sensory or causal information. A single over-rich line—“where tomorrow had learned to wait its turn”—survives because it pays off the title concept at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data + thematic overtone (“cultivated—that much was clear…became a small, contained sun”). No mixed metaphors; “cathedral of crystal” is singular image, not stacked. Scaffold screen: only one paraphrase loop (“walls when it should have learned to knock them down”) but it is intentional refrain, not artifact. Closure image unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer metaphor and action (“ivy…carrying life into old bones”). One paraphrase loop detected: “she had been flooded…she was still here” reiterates graffiti insight. Metaphors stay coherent—water, veins, tape—no mixed vehicles. Strong read-aloud cadence; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines carry triple duty: “words too dangerous to speak, too powerful to read aloud” advances atmosphere, theme, and stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—“clock cycling…like pages in a book”—and none clutter the final beat. One paraphrase loop: “documented everything she knew…annotations between cautious optimism and wild hope” could compress. Otherwise zero scaffold, strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with emotional tide; no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is dense but patterned—light through ice, gaps through fate—so density feels earned, not purple. Final line delivers closure without scaffold. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“had told her stories”) is too minor to ding.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence music is deliberate—cascading cadences mimic aurora—but occasional stacked modifiers (“radiant hush,” “crystalline structure”) tip toward purple; no loops or paraphrase cycles; final image remains clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose breathes with variable rhythm; clauses lengthen during contemplative garden beats, tighten aloft. Mixed metaphors are avoided; cloud-sea and vineyard hush coexist without collision. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”-level abstraction) nicks immediacy, but density stays high—each sentence advances image or stakes. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; final paragraph earns its declarative glow.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences perform double duty. Occasional lyrical overload (“pink fingers of dawn… fractured splinters”) risks purple, yet stays within POV’s mystical lexicon. No scaffold loops; pronouns clean. Final line lands with resonant punch, justifying earlier compression.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with near-zero scaffolding; only one paraphrase loop (“each circle born from the last, all of them traveling outward”) survives cut test. Metaphors stay consistent to water/wood registers; no mixed vehicles. High information density without clutter. One filter-verb cluster (“she watched… she saw… she understood”) appears mid-scene but does not infect the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet generally purposeful; each sentence layers texture or advances temporal marker (seasonal dust shift, afternoon light). Occasional stacked modifiers (“fossils of impossible creatures into cathedrals and monuments”) verge on purple but occur during low-tempo meditation, so momentum survives. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors detected. Final paragraph avoids cliché by returning to cooled arrowhead, giving tactile exit.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is clean, high-density; figurative language is selective and paid off (“lingering luminance” reappears in sunset blaze). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor overwrite: “brilliant dimness” risks self-contradiction but is earned by thematic context. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive. Two filter-verb slips (“she found it beautiful”) do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies—long breathy sentences in library hush, short pulse at meteor cross. Figurative language sparse enough to avoid muddle; each metaphor (lanterns like apologies, light fingerprints) recurs with shifted meaning. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Opening anchors voice, final line cadence echoes first lantern image, supplying propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, mostly loop-free; occasional adjective pairs (“smaller and stranger”) repeat but do not stall cadence. Mixed metaphor risk—“contracted cosmos,” “whispering stars”—stays coherent because physical rules are openly altered. One scaffold: “she would cast…she would continue casting” futures in closing paragraph; could trim. Otherwise information-dense, ear-pleasing, and closure-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does image + emotional torque + world rule (“the observatory clung to the cliff’s edge like a promise kept too long”). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay maritime/optical. Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Only hairline slip: “memories refusing to stay buried” is minor cliché, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances drip-count, body-cost, or bell-state. Metaphors stay inside POV lexicon; no mixed vehicles. Final clause (“patient and eternal, gentle and unstoppable”) is earned cadence, not purple overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but breathable; each sentence layers job, memory, and metaphor without paraphrase loops. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—reservoir as amnesia, label as heart—and vanish during the high-pressure final paragraph to preserve clarity. One minor scaffold: "photographs were not merely documentation; they were the method..." could compress, but it does not stall momentum. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but figurative density stacks high in every sentence of the climax, slightly dulling the closure image. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent. Strong verbs (“wove,” “cradled,” “wheeled”) anchor the lyricism. One scaffold stem—“everything she had…everything she had yet”—repeats without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is tight: no paraphrase loops, no scaffold, high density—“static had swallowed every frequency” does double duty for sound and stakes. Metaphors are few, precise, and physics-loyal. One tiny simultaneity hiccup: “I pulled my charts closer, the paper yellowed with years of use, and traced…” implies three concurrent acts; a sequential reorder would sharpen. Well below the artifact threshold that would cap 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers stakes, image, and world rule. Metaphors are spare and consistent—“membrane between imitation and authenticity”—never mixed. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Passive voice used once, deliberately (“had been burned”), to echo passivity of numbness. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “a consciousness that survived ego death by learning to feel through another.”

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: lines often do double duty (“moonlight fracture” paints seed + internal state). Figurative language is restrained; only two metaphors per beat, no purple accretion. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. One scaffold-like phrase—“that particular kind of storm-born silence”—but it serves as taught pattern and is paid off at end, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is musical—internal rhyme, assonance, varied sentence length—yet every paragraph restates the same connotation of grief-in-echo. “Macerate the stillness” recurs four times, becoming template cadence. Several sentences open with participial clusters that create simultaneity errors (“With his first pull, the machine sputtered to life…”) and stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line craft is dense yet breathable; figurative layering supports, not obscures, the arc. No loops or scaffold; each image advances atmosphere or interiority. Metaphors stay internally coherent (mist as breath, pendant as heartbeat). Occasional elevated diction (“dimensionally homesick”) is voice-motivated; register holds.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates breath with ember glow versus frost snap; no template cadence detected. Sentences carry double duty: “The flames caught instantly, impossibly, rising in colors that had no names” advances action, stakes, and conceptual break in one sweep. One mixed-metaphor risk—“withered flower” of metal—reads intentional, fused to Mara’s priest-memory, and does not blur causality. Zero paraphrase loops; high information density maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, character tool-use, and world rule ("fragment...hummed at frequencies no natural stone should produce"). Metaphors are spare and coherent ("silence...like a knife through water"). Occasional adjectival pairing ("serenely electric") risks register drift but is voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Final paragraph breathes without sluggishness, letting closure image linger.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional modifier stacks (“light and shadow interweaving in those intricate patterns”) verge on overwriting without pattern pay-off. One paraphrase loop near midpoint; no loops touch closure. Strong read-aloud rhythm overall.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers craft, perception, and world (e.g., “sinew thread sang slightly…leaving faint trails of phosphorescence”). Figurative vehicles stay coherent; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffolding. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge. Tiny hedge: “seemed to” appears twice near peak illumination, momentarily softening certainty—still within 8.5 range.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “cold metal press against her ribs” does tactile work in five words. No filter-verb clusters or template cadence; sentence rhythm varies, accelerating during descent, then lengthening for meditative calculation beats. Metaphors stay coherent—light “folded into distant memory” keeps within nautical/epistemic register. Minor loss of 9+ edge because two “had” pluperfects in paragraph four slacken momentum for an instant.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, with high information density; most sentences do two jobs. Occasional lyric uplift (“shadows pooled like spilled ink”) risks prettiness yet serves mood. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. A few adjectival stacks (“impossible lightness,” “gray silence”) slightly dilute peak clarity, preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: single sentences deliver setting, stake, and image (“walls lined with the undersea cables…copper cores that glinted like ancient bones”). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances. Metaphor vehicles stay consistent (bones, library, arteries). One mixed image—“whispers…threaded through the copper like ghosts in a machine”—is tolerable. Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure. Occasional adjectival boost (“impossible way,” “ancient bones”) slightly purple but kept in POV awe.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but patterned: each metaphor (opal bone, snow equations, ink tears) recurs with accrued meaning; no mixed vehicles or synonym loops. One scaffold—“she had only wanted efficiency, had only wanted to help”—is justified as ghost-protocol stutter, not slop.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers sensory or acoustic data; no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors; occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant reconfiguration”) is earned by context; final third free of artifacts, allowing closure image to ring clear.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with the garden’s pulse; sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful, pattern-taught early. One paraphrase loop—“refusing to be contained, refusing to be categorized, refusing to be anything...”—dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise clean mechanics, zero typos, strong verbs, no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences do double duty: “golden fruit glowing beneath leaves that hadn’t turned in decades” layers visual, temporal, and ecological anomaly in twelve words. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats (winter branches → sap in spring). Read-aloud rhythm accelerates across the final paragraph without stumbling. Zero line-level artifacts; figurative language peaks precisely at the closure beat, charging the image without purple obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences carry double duty—worldbuild and pressure—without scaffold. Metaphors (border lines in eyes not dirt, dawn spreading across face) are fresh and internally consistent. One minor loop: “medicine that the eastern pharmacies refused to stock” echoes next paragraph; could compress. Otherwise no filter-verb stacks, no mixed vehicles; closure line maintains clarity and lift.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; mixed metaphors are rare. One scaffold loop: “not an absence but an invitation… not a void but a promise” paraphrases twice. Figurative language clusters in the halo paragraph but does not obscure causality. Final third is clean; 9+ still possible.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid descriptive coils to the staccato of “She was not afraid.” Information density is high: one sentence fuses architecture, emotion, and myth. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay consistent (space-fabric, fold-memory). Minor filter verb (“seemed to respond”) but forgiven inside a POV who measures tentatively.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence; only one paraphrase loop (“longing… longing”) appears and serves as intentional echo. Metaphors stay coherent—light as paint, dreams as cargo—and never stall forward motion. Proofing is clean; pronouns track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences carry double duty (image + motion). One mixed metaphor cluster (“extinctions…candle” beside “cosmic possibility”) slightly blurs the peak beat, but clarity survives. No loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks; diction stays within locksmith’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Figurative density is high but patterned (leviathan, Heron, photograph in solution) and pays off at closure; no mixed metaphors, no loops. One paraphrase loop (“chronically curious…hunger”) is repeated three times—minor scar, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sparing metaphor density—every image (glass-pressed leaf as 标本) is re-used to teach reversal. Sentence rhythms lengthen during reflection, tighten during pour/reach beat, propelling momentum. Zero paraphrase loops; “afternoon” recurs only as temporal anchor, not filler. One near-mixed metaphor: “dark leaf of stillness” reads fine under light logic, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates like water—long fluid clauses interrupted by precise cuts: “She cleared the deadwood… sang to the wounds.” Figurative density is high but patterned early (“mist rose like whispered prayers”) so it reads as taught texture, not clutter. A few near-loop phrases—“between what was and what might be” appear twice—mildly dull momentum yet never coincide with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template drumbeat. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—light broken/redirected echoes spirit/mask parallels. Scaffolding is minimal; one paraphrase loop (“remembered being new…remembered why”) is acceptable within lyric pattern. Closing clause “some truths could only be revealed in the breaking” borders on thematic summary but lands as image-charged aphorism, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates gracefully; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Occasional elevated diction (“pregnant with accumulated whispers”) skirts purple but stays pattern-justified. Information density high; only minor loop near “reverence…inheritors” phrasing. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm breathes from long reflective lines to tight motor-action clauses; high information density without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent, no mixed vehicles in peak beats, clean propulsion to the settling-snow close.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates with atmospheric pressure; sentences breathe longer during mist drift, fracture at electrical discharge. Two adjacent near-repeats ("sequences...sequences") and one mixed metaphor (" swallowed by the wind") keep it from 9+, but none occur in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is textured but disciplined: strong verbs (“fractured,” “nestled”), selective metaphors, only one near-filter (“seemed almost to glow”) forgiven by POV uncertainty. Rhythm modulates; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. One mixed image (“sunlight… ribbons… glow”) in an otherwise high-pressure paragraph keeps it from the 8+ band. Closure line is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Almost every sentence does two jobs: “scholars had climbed its internal spiral staircases to reach shelves that spiraled upward like the rings of growth themselves” fuses setting, history, metaphor in one breath. Minor scaffold emerges in “patterns” repetitions, but pattern is diegetic, not artifact. No mixed metaphor; opening and closing images book-end cleanly. A lone paraphrase loop (“she understood this principle instinctively” following similar thought) prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor filter slips (“she found what she had been unconsciously seeking”) and one paraphrase loop (“patterns that seemed almost deliberate—gatherings and dispersals…”) slightly dull immediacy. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with the ritual beats; metaphor density is high but patterned (moon, driftwood, eclipse) and pays off in the final image. No scaffold loops or mixed vehicles. Minor elevation in diction is motivated by the cathedral-like setting. Sentences do multiple jobs—e.g., “Each disappearance rippled the reflection…” advances plot, image, and interior state in one sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is musical but occasionally overwritten: “fruit in colors found nowhere on Earth” is tourist-catalog vague; “scheduled tenderness” mixed-metaphor straddles mechanical/organic. Some template cadence in tripled participles (“had watched… had watched… had grown”). Information density good—each sentence layers history or sensory cue. No loops in final third; closure image remains clear. Registers minor metaphor muddle, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence variation is deliberate—cumulative anaphora (“every brass gear… every cradle… every sunset”) creates liturgical cadence rather than template monotony. Mixed metaphors are scarce; “bruise healing into beauty” is the one strained overlap, but it reinforces thematic color and occurs mid-scene, not at closure. No filter-verb stacks; scaffolding is minimal. One paraphrase loop: “beauty at the edge of endings” echoes twice in adjacent sentences, costing −0.2, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; most sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Occasional adjective stacks—“offhandedly exact geography”—slightly overdecorate a high-pressure beat, but metaphor logic stays coherent. Zero loops, clean tense, strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—each sentence advances image or concept. One scaffold detected: “patterns in the foam were extraordinary—spirals within spirals” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t touch closure. No mixed metaphors; technical terms accurate. Final line earns its length because cadence carries the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no filler loops. Clause rhythm modulates to match the hush of the library. Minor scaffold: “stories waiting to be born” / “narratives still forming” are adjacent paraphrases. Image density stays high without purple overload. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned—culinary and marine metaphors interweave without mixed clashes. High information density: one sentence often performs sensory, emotional, and world-rule work. One paraphrase loop detected (“each formation a memory made solid… stored remorse”) costs −0.2; artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; figurative layering (“gravitational pull of community needs”) is purposeful and paid off. Occasional scaffold—“had rehabilitated” repeated in anaphora—creates mild loopiness mid-paragraph but never obscures causality or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering (“silver and shadow intervals,” “chaotically precise movements”) supports concept without clogging beats. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One clause—“the transformation was complete”—skirts summary, but it is offset by immediate bodily re-viewing of canyon. Read-aloud ear passes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. Information density is high—each line advances image, character, or concept. One paraphrase loop appears (“like being born into air, like crossing a threshold while remaining somehow still”) but serves lyrical reinforcement, not slack. No mixed metaphors or register drift; figurative language stays within the POV’s arcane lexicon. Proofing error: “sprolved” is likely a typo for “sprouted,” but the neologism is contextually legible and pattern-consistent, so only a hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from long, breath-held clauses to the final spare chord; no template cadence. Figurative layer is dense but each metaphor (cracks as nodes, roots as bass) advances causality, not decoration. Zero paraphrase loops; every paragraph advances knowledge or acoustic charge. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm modulates with eclipse breath-metaphor; sentences lengthen then contract. No synonym loops or scaffold. Two adjacent “he had” anaphoras are purposeful pattern, not template. Abstract nouns (“motivation,” “circumstances”) appear in reflective paragraph but are offset by tactile stone imagery. Closure line is clean, no mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between speculative cadence and tactile beats; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are few, integrated, and non-contradictory: “static like snow falling on a dead television screen” is precise to her era and vocation. High information density: each sentence does two jobs—advances tuning and layers silence taxonomy. Only minor scaffold: “she understood that empathy could not be rushed” could be shown even more granularly, but it does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances scent, emotion, or ritual. Figurative language is spare and organic—“ghost of elderflower sap,” “purple-black like a bruise healing.” Information density high: one line of journal compresses three months of tacit learning. Final paragraph’s quiet cadence earns read-aloud poise without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is deliberate: long aerial coils for drift, staccato bursts for bloom eruption. Mixed metaphors are functional (water as clasped hands, stone as ribs) because unified by pilot-body scale. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Only nit: “crystal-line question marks” edges cute, but image justifies itself by sync with inversion logic and is never repeated.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry double duty—description plus data value—maintaining momentum. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“fog…held breath”) are sparse and purposeful. One mixed vehicle: “wind…into a weapon” is abstract but brief. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match crystallizing dread. Clean, efficient, near-publish level.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax, echoing the mounting overtones; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay within acoustic/light physics—filament, spectrum, resonance—so vehicles remain coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“patient conjunction,” “chromatic truth”) borders on thesaurus-adjacent but is earned by cathedral scale and does not blur causality. One mixed moment: “silence that resounded” is oxymoronic by design; context justifies it, so clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence fronts, high information density. One paraphrase loop: “silence could speak louder than alarm” / “silence speaking of all the songs it had witnessed” within four lines—minor. Occasional stacked modifiers (“tiny suspended worlds waiting to be born”) flirt with purple but serve the filtered light moment. No figurative muddle in the closure beat; final paragraph is clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence performs double duty—e.g., “amber light filtering… was not merely color but a condition of perception.” Metaphors stay internally consistent (light = accounting unit). No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct. Opening and closing lines act as mirror-topaz and transparent light—bookending without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative clauses build awe, then single-clause cuts (“She tucked the pendant back”) propel descent. No loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“roots of something waiting to break through soil” paired with winged pendant—barely grazes coherence. Line density high; each sentence advances image or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence performs double duty—description plus emotional decoding. No synonym loops or scaffold; “frost” returns only when meaning has shifted. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “cathedral made of crystallized whispers” is sustained by the quiet acoustics throughout. One hairline slip: “pleasant persistence” edges toward oxymoronic filler but occurs early and doesn’t dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from sinuous thread-like loops to staccato scissor cuts, rhythm matching emotional torque. No loops or synonym churn; each image is single-use precise. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“raveling silence”) and paid off. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo—“forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest”—creating circular weave without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Varied sentence rhythm supports the accumulative arc; no loops or scaffold. Figurative choices—“blackened fingers reaching toward arches”—are sparse, purposeful, and consistent with burn imagery. Information density is high: each sentence advances either tunnel progress or emotional subtraction. One minor filter verb cluster (“he understood that beauty was a frivolous thing”) escapes penalty because it triggers the pivotal decision to repurpose the silk.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, high-density; most sentences carry dual duty. No loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle: “cognitive wind” beside “everything tilting” is nearly contradictory but reads as synesthetic overload rather than muddle. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“rang,” “swirling,” “tilting”) propel. One paraphrase overlap: “membrane between worlds grew thin” echoed three sentences later as “membrane began to thin”; minor.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate. Figurative language is spare and precise—no stacked metaphors in peak beats. Information density is high: one sentence can deliver sensory detail, backstory cue, and causal link. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no scaffold artifacts in closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lush but selective metaphor; no mixed vehicles. Occasional modifier stacks (“fragile and essential all at once”) slow propulsion yet serve incantatory rhythm. Information density high; each sentence advances ritual or stakes. Zero loops, no scaffold. Read-aloud ear test passes—varied sentence lengths mirror keeper’s breathing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies; stacked color metaphors are pattern-taught and paid off, not overwritten. No loops or synonym churn. “Sun trails trace their patient paths” is a single instance of near-template cadence but fits dye-master idiom. Information density high—each sentence advances image or realization. Clean grammar, precise tense.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and stress, propelling the ascent and the subsequent unmaking. Figurative language is dense yet patterned—moonlight as solvent, sorrow as sand—teaching its own logic early and paying off in the final image. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. A single near-cliché (“half-remembered prayer”) is forgiven for its immediate contextual twist.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught early and paid off in the refracted dawn image—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“shattered mirror… mirror cracks”) is allowable motif reinforcement rather than scaffold. High information density; each line performs dual duty of atmosphere and causal preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes—long sentences for nostalgia, shorter pulses at midnight. Mixed metaphors are few; “stone in her chest” is stock but isolated. Repetition of “crumpled invitation” and “arm’s reach” functions as motif rather than loop. Filter verbs minimal; information density high; no scaffolding obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences breathe in step with seasonal calm, avoid scaffold; occasional adjective pairs (“stale but not rotten, hard but not corrupted”) feel slightly mannered but never muddy. No loops, no mixed metaphor; clarity and momentum hold through the lyrical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe with observation beats. Figurative language is sparse except where needed (“embers refusing to surrender”) and never muddles causality. No synonym loops or scaffold. Opening and closing lines bookend with “luminous” / “luminous persistence,” a purposeful echo that recharges motif. Minor elevation in diction stays within archivist’s professional reach.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, image-dense, and mostly propulsive. One paraphrase loop (“learned patience… watching rhythm”) and a mixed metaphor (“laws felt different—stretched thin like tarpaulins”) slightly dull the edge. Otherwise sentences carry double duty; no filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Final paragraph lands cleanly without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph lengths vary to create visual cadence. Information density high—“compass ring had emerged from being a simple directional tool into something more” marries exposition and metaphor in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors are coherent: aurora as memory, compass as bridge. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing”-type wording but does not cloud causality. Clean copy; no typos, tense slips, or buried leads.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high density—each sentence layers metaphor, memory, and physical cue without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors avoided: lock tumblers = fused joints = creative paralysis stays consistent. Near-closure line “earth’s own watercolor” is concise, registers taste-borne inspiration, no purple drift. Occasional Latinate elevation (“prismatic tears,” “mnemonically gifted”) fits narrator’s self-distancing intellect; does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description, metaphor, and emotional advance woven without scaffold. Rhythm breathes: long inhalations of setting, quick exhalations of action. Metaphors stay consistent (garden, metal memory, suns of gold) and avoid muddle. Only a single paraphrase loop (“growing upward, growing inward, growing truthful”) risks cadence redundancy, but it reads intentional to accrual design.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet transparent; metaphors are clean—“captive star,” “thoughts that had forgotten their owners.” One mixed image: “fullness of another kind” edges toward abstraction, but context rescues it. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final third is pristine, allowing 8+ retention.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate algorithmic lilt that melts into organic cadence—mirror of her transformation. Metaphors are internally coherent (magnetic ribbons, origami shadows) and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle on box, roses, or static. Information density high: one line does three jobs—e.g., “roses did not know they were artificial, and neither, increasingly, did Cara” = world rule + character blur + foreshadow. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is mostly clean, with high information density—each sentence layers object, history, and metaphor. A few soft loops: "worn stone tiles" followed by "worn path," "stillness" echoed twice in two sentences; these are minor. Metaphors stay coherent (mailbox as sentinel, letters as pressed flowers). Filter-verb clusters absent; strong verbs dominate. Final paragraph’s repeated anaphora ("that particular stillness") is purposeful cadence rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines carry double duty—description advances decryption plot while crafting lyrical cadence. Metaphors stay coherent within liquid physics: dangling screens as “rusted stalactites” is precise. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she began to dance”) are justified by the need to mark the shift into wordless language. No mixed vehicles or scaffold repetition obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean even when lush: every metaphor does double duty—salt crystals are both scenery and data storage. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances placement, image, or emotional charge. One mixed vehicle—“memories drifted… seeking shelter in the salt crystals”—is forgiven because the anthropomorphism is later literalized within world logic. Clause rhythm varies purposefully, propelling the descent without tripping the read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances hush-layer or character knowledge. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—moonlight as flame, prophecy as frequency—no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety propels the ritual crescendo then settles into the quiet final cadence. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“carrying truth downstream”) that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “circular impression of a desk seal pressed into its wood decades ago” fuses object, history, sensory echo. No synonym loops; each metaphor (stars as corrections) extends single conceit. One passive—“had been buried”—justified as Elena’s inference. Rhythm breathes: long accumulative clauses build to short declarative “I don’t need to know.” Zero scaffolding, high density.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines are dense and propulsive; most sentences perform two jobs (atmosphere + interiority or world-rule + emotional tilt). Figurative layering is selective, never more than one image per high-pressure sentence, so metaphor coherence holds. One adjacent paraphrase loop—“her grandmother had achieved what she set out to do. The archive was real…”—restates without new pressure, triggering a minor artifact flag. Closure image itself is clean, allowing the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is high-density and propulsive; most sentences carry image + motion + theme duty simultaneously (“each drop a heartbeat in the cathedral’s silent pulse”). Metaphors stay coherent—stalactite time, ink as forgiveness, thorn as ancestry—without mixed vehicles. Only micro-loop: “patient as stalactites drip” echoed in closing paragraph. No filter-verb stacks, no purple overload; paragraph cuts would remove muscle, not fat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—metaphors extend acoustic logic. One paraphrase loop: “she had spent…she had come…” (adjacent sentences) costs −0.2. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“progressive disclosure”) momentarily lifts POV register, but usage is brief. Closure line breathes cleanly; no artifact touches final image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences read aloud with fluid rhythm; figurative layering is dense yet purposeful, never obscuring causality. Occasional near-repetition (“she had come… she had pulled… she had glimpsed”) creates minor模板 cadence but does not stall propulsion or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Mixed metaphors are intentionally braided (nets, moon paths, fireflies) under taught accumulative pattern, so coherence holds. No scaffold, no filter-verb clusters in peak beat. Opening and closing lines perform double duty—anchor voice and reweight motif. Information density high; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or filter stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“metastasized,” “crystalline records”) fits Mira’s analytic lens. No mixed metaphors; clarity stays intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphor density is high but pattern-taught early (lightning = veins = rivers), paid off in portico bloom. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; each figurative layer reweights stakes. Sentence variety offsets any purple risk. Final image “figure made of storm and starlight” is precise, not vague glitter.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is musical yet disciplined; only one paraphrase loop (“sounds…not sounds, but stories…not recordings, but relationships”). Metaphors stay coherent (wind-chime pockets, impatient-artist windows). High density without purple drift; final clause “most permanent currency of all” flirts with maxim but earns its place via prior economies.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “azure coat snapping,” “copper cradle,” “C-sharp warping jagged” perform atmosphere, world-rule, and stakes in one stroke. Rhythm modulates effectively; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—only minor softener (“world feel both beautiful and impermanent”) could trim. Closure line clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “ice spoke in groans and cracks” does triple sensory duty. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay geologic and coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“parchment-thin boundary”) is justified by cartographer POV. Final sentence lands with crystalline cadence that recharges “horizons” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and rarely wasteful, but two adjacent “Elena could still see… Elena understood then” create template cadence. Mixed metaphor “water returned with vengeance” clashes with later flame imagery. No loops near closure; final sentence lands crisply. Artifacts are minor but keep the piece below high-band polish.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; no template cadence runs. Metaphors are coherent (ledger, dropped coin, storm-light) and sparse enough to avoid purple clutter. One paraphrase loop: “always changing, always revealing” repeats the prior clause’s essence; minor −0.2. Otherwise high density—each sentence advances image or moral calculus. No artifact touches the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each image does world-plus-emotion work (“light break into unexpected geometries” shows acid refraction, cart awe, and metaphor for knowledge). Figurative language is patterned—gear/sea/light triad—paid off in final frequency hum; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: occasional triple modifier (“particular adoration reserved for things that shouldn't exist but do”) barely slackens momentum. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; remains propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: “digital ghost images” does world + emotion in three words. No synonym loops or template cadences. Metaphors stay coherent (“silence that echoed louder”). Minor filter verb cluster (“she noticed,” “she understood”) in explanatory beats but never in peak image. Final sentence is clean; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech, avoiding template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned (light/ice/mirror) and pays off in closure, so no penalty. One paraphrase loop: “she understood… she understood” within five lines—minor. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Strong information density: each sentence layers image and stakes simultaneously. Line artifacts never touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits rhythmic variation and high density; figurative language is selective, never floods a beat. No loops or scaffold detected; sentences advance image or pressure. Opening and closing lines frame voice and stake cleanly. One near-mixed metaphor (“fold in patience”) is minor; clarity preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is textured yet economical: “sand grains rearranged themselves at certain hours” does triple sensory, temporal, and uncanny duty. Occasional softeners—“seemed to grow,” “almost comprehensible”—slightly dampen authority. No loops or mixed metaphors; one paraphrase loop (“the prophet’s words continued to echo…”) is forgiven for incantatory effect. Overall rhythm supports momentum without purple drag.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic variety and sensory specificity; however, occasional modifier stacks (“purple blooms swaying in the warm breeze like thousands of tiny lanterns”) edge toward purple. No paraphrase loops or template cadences, but two adjacent “slowly” constructions create minor echo. Closure image is crisp and uncluttered, so artifacts do not touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “the chandeliers caught the gas lamps and threw fractured rainbows” does triple sensory work. Rhythm modulates from processional opening to short declarative close. No paraphrase loops, no therapy-speak. Minor purple flash—“nocturnal sighs”—pays off in sonic motif, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with discovery—long coils of image, then a short gasp (“It was smaller than that”). Figurative density is high but patterned early, so it reads as voice, not purple. No loops, no scaffold; each clause adds new sensory angle. One mixed metaphor: “tidal longing… like a mother holding a child” momentarily merges ocean and cradle, but clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned—every metaphor serves atmosphere or theme. opening/closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive. Only hairline slip: “ancient脾气” code-switch feels unmotivated, but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene temperature; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Metaphors (“small golden moon”) are sparse, precise, paid off. One mixed image—“architecture of grace built against the coming dark”—is gracefully apt, not strained. Information density high: “blood work had come back... walked directly... fifteen years helping” layers backstory, motive, and stakes in 24 words.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is mostly clean and propulsive; occasional poetic duplication (“slowly, deliberately” used twice) and stacked metaphors (“symphony of enchantments,” “breath returning to a sleeping body”) flirt with overwriting but never stall causality. No loops or filter-verb stacks; grammar and tense stable. Closure image is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences perform the slow kneel then star-burst lift. Information density high—each line does two jobs (setting + memory). One paraphrase loop (“never quite...never fully”) is minor. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Artifacts do not touch closure, keeping 8+ viable.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the melt-drip cadence; clauses vary, no algorithmic repetition. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“each droplet tracing a slow, deliberate path”). High density: one line often performs scene-setting + interiority + symbolic charge. A few near-paraphrase loops (“quietly proactive… quietly proffers… simply stay”) prevent a clean 9; still, no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence length. A few adjacency loops (“abandoned… abandoned”; “different… different”) and one mixed metaphor (“current of her own better judgment” vs. river current) dull immediacy but do not touch closure. Density is high; no filter-verb stacks or scaffolding that obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: paragraph lengths swell/contract like tidal breath; sentence openings vary; no loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors are coherent—“golden threads like spun sunlight” keeps within loom logic. One mixed vehicle: “mist…clung…painted…amber and pearl” layers tactile/cliché color, but it lands in calm beat, not closure. Information density high; every clause either enriches setting or interiority. Minor purple tint but no clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths breathe with kneeling, arranging, sealing. Information density high—each relic carries metaphoric and cartographic load without scaffold. Figurative language is coherent: frost, starlight, and mirror shards share brittle luminescence logic. Only micro-loop: “pattern” appears three times in one sentence; does not touch closure. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythmic variety: long reflective sentences alternate with crisp image beats; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“echoes like sediment forming stone” extends setting logic. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor filter verb cluster around “seemed” in paragraph one, but it serves peripheral epistemology, not slackness. Propulsion remains steady to the resonant final line.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but patterned: fractal imagery repeats with variation, avoiding loop. Metaphors remain coherent within mineral/marine logic; no mixed vehicles. Clause rhythm modulates to mimic breathing, propelling the accumulative beat. One paraphrase loop (“layer upon layer of silence”) is forgivable in 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with carve-and-pause action; paragraph breaks mirror chisel lifts. Figurative layering (“color of old iron,” “crystallized time”) is dense yet consistently welded to sensory ground. One scaffold detected: “the work was love, and the work was letting go, and the work was keeping hold…” triple anaphora borders template cadence but reads intentional as incantatory closure. No mixed metaphors, no paraphrase loops; information load per sentence is high yet clear.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is dense and musical; metaphors are self-consistent (smoke-ribbon music, sediment in plastic). One scaffold loop near midpoint—“fragments... fragments... fragments”—but it serves accumulative pattern, not artifact. No mixed metaphors in peak beat; camera stilling is literal and symbolic simultaneously. Opening/ending lines are ear-tested for cadence punch.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose breathes—sentence lengths vary, paragraphs cut cleanly. Occasional loftiness (“psychological architecture as complex as the physical tunnels”) risks self-paralleling but lands within POV lexicon. No loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor: “hollow ribcage against the gray morning sky” is forgiven for vivid anchoring. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and reverb.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is high-density and lyrical yet propulsive; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors are physically coherent (light through water, gears sighing). One clause shows mild register uplift—“conceptual repricing” isn’t in the narrator’s idiom—but occurs outside the closure beat. Opening and closing sentences function as audible brackets: stopped tick / unstopped tick.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer cadences for twilight contemplation, shorter clauses at the steering beat. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“twilight settle over the canal like a held breath”—and never clusters to obscure causality. Information density is high; each sentence layers history, motive, and sensory cue. One paraphrase loop detected (“someone who had once trusted this small instrument to tell them the hour when clocks were unreliable or non-existent”) costs −0.2; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative language is selective, not stacked. One scaffold risk: “patient as the tide” / “certain as the return of light” verge on proverb, but they close the piece and echo earlier patience, so the loop feels earned rather than redundant. No filter-verb clusters; pronouns stay clean.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences vary from long breathless accumulations to curt fragments that mimic leaf-fall; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each line advances texture or knowledge, climaxing in the clean strike of “first stroke of the map.”

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences pivot on semicolons and em-dashes to create cadence breath. Occasional adjective stacks (“mechanical flowers frozen mid-bloom”) flirt with excess but serve wonder. One paraphrase loop: “hypothesizing about everything” is repeated twice without new angle. No mixed metaphors; closure line is clean. Density is high—most lines perform double duty—keeping the piece above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; no synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent: sand “like powdered obsidian,” coin “glowed like an ember” both obey thermal logic. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Final clause triad (“not unscathed but unbowed, not healed but healing”) earns its parallelism as culminating cadence, not filler. Clean grammar; tactile verbs (“sift,” “press,” “clung”) keep momentum alive.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence shapes, high information density. Two adjacent “patience” clauses near midpoint loop concept without new pressure. Metaphors coherent; no mixed vehicles. One template cadence: three successive “she...” opens in paragraph 5. None of these touch the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. One mixed-metaphor risk (“cold flame of pure intention”) is earned by the conceptual reprice at closure. No loops, no register drift; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the zero-g drift, accelerating at the gear’s tick.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Varied sentence rhythm supports breathless ascent: cumulative clauses stack like wingbeats, then cut to three-word shard “this is enough.” Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass “rusting into autumn,” humidity that “carries sound”—no mixed vehicles. Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges “hands … patient and eternal.”

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“sea of frozen flames,” “sky bruised purple and gold”—never muddles physics. Information dense: each sentence advances image, back-story, or present micro-choice. One passive (“the rake had been”) intentionally frames history; otherwise strong verbs dominate. No artifacts in closure beat; qualifies for 8-band but occasional elevated metaphor keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is largely clean, with purposeful compression—six sentences cover descent, discovery, and first contact. Occasional ornamental clustering (“cobalt silo, a cylindrical chamber of blue-tinged stone”) repeats hue without fresh information. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory anchors are concrete. One paraphrase loop appears: “darkness of endings… darkness… instead like a threshold,” shaving precision. No artifact touches the final image, so momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “iridescent blue-green of the kingfisher feather quill nib” packs color, material, and memory in one noun phrase. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors (lake as timeline shards) cohere. One mixed moment—“cosmic accident” slightly jars empirical voice—kept from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry density: “copying orchestral scores with the patience of someone who believed that every note preserved was a story saved from vanishing entirely” performs three jobs (world, motive, stakes). Figurative layer is selective—mist as slow waves, dust as memory—never floods the beat. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge; no artifacts in final third. High-band clarity is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each clause layers sensory or symbolic weight without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent; ash “veins” fit porcelain fractures. A single faint echo (“something approached that Mira could not see” / “something that could be released and thus preserved”) is the only recyclable stem and does not graze the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density without scaffold: single sentences deliver setting, backstory, and metaphor concurrently—“merchant guilds to evacuate their most valuable holdings” embeds causality inside texture. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and paid off (“sedimentary layers of story that accumulate like geological strata”). No loops or synonym churn; one near-repeat of “sedimentary layers” is thematically motivated. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, paragraph lengths varied. Closure line is sharp and cadence cleaned, satisfying ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with variable sentence lengths; metaphor density kept purposeful and subordinate to hush. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“swallowed his consonants,” “velocity of silence”) carry weight. Occasional elevated phrasing (“expectantly resigned despair”) edges toward thesis-speak but occurs outside peak beat; no loops or mixed metaphors at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from lush, vowel-heavy wonder to staccato pruning beats. Figurative language is selective: “iron bones weeping orange tears” condenses rust, architecture, and grief in one image. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Information density stays high—each sentence advances memory, setting, or stake. A single scaffold clause (“she had left that world behind”) is justified compression.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: “collected static charges pilgrims brought from the hills” does triple duty—world rule, character task, and foreshadowing of wonder-as-fuel. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical or relational detail. Figurative language stays spare except the nectar dusk, which recurs only twice and is justified by sky color. Clean grammar, no simultaneity errors, pronouns track across child/toll-keeper shift.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythmic modulation carries reader forward; clauses accrete like silt without paraphrase loops. Occasional stack of two adjectives (“salt-worn clapboard,” “faint residual warmth”) stays within POV lexicon and avoids purple overload. One mixed micro-image (“daydreaming streetlights”) is ornamental, not muddling, and occurs early, leaving closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences breathe with variable rhythm; metaphors (tapestry thread, light through water) are restrained and coherent. One paraphrase loop (“both...both...”) and slight scaffold in epiphany paragraph keep it from 9.0, but no figurative muddle touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “grim optimism,” “bounded infinity,” “texture of a missed opportunity” all compress complex states. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Information density high—each sentence advances pattern, character, or atmosphere. A single near-purple phrase—“perfect paradox of bounded infinity”—is earned by repetition and payoff, so allowed. Closure line is clean, resonant, unscaffolded.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm: sentence length varies, paragraph breaks mirror heartbeat. High density: single sentence paints city haze, scent, moon, motivation. No synonym loops; “moon-tipped brush” returns with accrued meaning. Metaphors consistent (stars bleeding, saffron quiet) and physically coherent. One scaffold trace: “the kind that comes after…” clause could trim, but doesn’t touch closure. Opening and final lines frame and recharge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines are dense but breathe: “rosewater dread” and “alphabet of sustenance” compress scent + fear + concept without flab. Only minor template cadence in the tripled “that” clauses when listing crafts; otherwise rhythm tracks the waterfall’s crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful sentence variety. Information density high: one line often fuses image, emotion, and world rule (“salt and sawdust, cluttered with her neatly inventive constructions”). One paraphrase loop—“time’s natural progression… unwinded hours and inverted minutes”—dulls momentum slightly. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding; clarity survives the lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose carries high-density metaphor yet stays legible; no mixed vehicles. Occasional cadence echo (“too loud, too sharp, too real”) reads intentional, taught early, paid off in softened dawn. Minor scaffold: “the night after” opener could tighten. Condensation-washed mirrors create tactile closure image without overwriting. No artifacts touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence mirrors the surf-music; sentences vary in length, no template runs. Only minor filter-verb cluster (“she had learned to read…” twice) keeps it from 9+. Metaphors stay maritime-consistent; no mixed vehicles in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; opening anchors voice and stakes. Sparse figurative language serves atmosphere—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “patterns... pattern language... pattern-between” could compress, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, high-density, and largely loop-free; occasional Latinate abstraction ("conceptual repricing," "sanctioned fictions") slightly dilutes immediacy but stays within academic POV. One paraphrase loop near midpoint ("how communities chose their heroes and why they clung...") could compress. Otherwise sentences carry double duty—image plus concept—and the final cadence lands.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety and sensory precision carry momentum; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“widow’s veils,” “bruised sky”) risks purple yet stays anchored in POV’s romantic-archivist lens. Metaphors remain coherent: rust “bleeds,” kelp “drapes,” absence “interlaces.” One filter-verb cluster mid-discovery is forgivable. Final line offers resonant cadence that recharges earlier motifs without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: varied sentence cadence, strong verbs (“tracing,” “embedded,” “crystallized”), minimal adverbs. One mixed metaphor (“stillness settled…like a garment”) barely grazes clarity; no loops or scaffold. Information frequently dual-loads—e.g., “submerged city’s archive” delivers world fact + atmospheric weight in four words.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breatheable; sentences carry double duty—mood and information—without scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“gray morning like smoke from a candle she'd forgotten to extinguish”) risk purple, but the cadence is pattern-taught early and sustains. No loops or paraphrase beats.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density; most sentences advance image, atmosphere, or interiority. Figurative language clustered but pattern-taught (“pools of unused potential” recurs) and resolves cleanly. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Minor filter-verb stack (“feels intangibly tangible”) forgiven as it names the paradox driving hunt. Closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable—“sleeping sentinels,” “knif-edge ridge” compress atmosphere without purple drift. Sentence rhythm modulates: short beats for climb, longer coils for revelation. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language peaks at closure but remains coherent (“brilliant dimness” paradox is earned).

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical with only minor abstraction loops (“weight of unspoken words” twice). Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Clause variety and paragraph cuts propel momentum; opening and final lines bookend with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. Information density is high—one sentence often layers tactile memory, generational scope, and present stance. No mixed metaphors; the "familiar word" simile is precise. Paraphrase loops are absent. Minor scaffold: “neither of them…” echoed twice in closing paragraph; does not touch closure. Opening and final lines anchor and release with acoustic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety is organic—participle openers (“Dragging her kayak…”) give way to sequential simple past, mirroring the shift from hesitation to rhythm. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new pressure or sensory bite. Figurative language is spare but precise: “tide pools in drought” compresses climate and psyche without purple strain. The single micro-flaw is the echo of “regretfully” used three times in one paragraph; it nicks the ear but falls outside the closure beat, keeping the score inside the 9-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence can layer physical motion, world-rule cue, and emotional torque. Metaphors are spare and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated phrase (“ancient conference”) is motived by awe; no loops or synonym churn. Final line cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is textured yet propulsive; metaphors braid scent, light, and heartbeat without mixed logic. A few adjacent near-paraphrases (“like water, like welcome, like the arms...”) create list-loop but pass the ear test aloud. No filter-verb clusters or scaffold. One register spike: “cosmic intimacy” feels coined; tonally earned but borderline. Artifact-free in the closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is rhythmically alive, sentences varied, no template cadence. Figurative density is high but purposeful, taught early (“rivers of molten silver”) and paid off in the bleeding vein of light. Minor scaffold: “she had…she had…” anaphora in paragraph 2, but it evokes liturgical cadence that fits ritual mood and stops short of cluttering the climax. No mixed metaphors or forced elevation detected.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety is musical; no template cadence. Information density high—“salvaged optical fiber” does world, character, and action work simultaneously. Figurative control sustains metaphor field (light, gravity, tears) without muddle or mixed vehicle. Only micro-loop: “dust motes that collected in corners where gravity pools gathered” repeats dust image; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but coordinated: each sentence layers task—advancing image, stakes, and atmosphere simultaneously. Metaphors stay coherent (light as captured stars, transformation as water/fingers) and avoid muddle. Occasional elevated phrasing (“prophecy walking itself out through her willing feet”) fits the lyric register and is earned. No loops, scaffold, or register drift appear in final third; read-aloud rhythm breathes with eclipse cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid with varied sentence lengths; opening sentence anchors stakes and atmosphere efficiently. No loops or scaffold; occasional adjective stacks (“faint amber glow,” “harsh white glare”) are purposeful for tonal contrast. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or mechanism—keeping momentum despite reflective lulls.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: high information density with minimal scaffold; no paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors are internally coherent (mercury ribbons, living constellation) and do not collide with frictionless physics. Strong verbs anchor action—“eels rose…like a constellation becoming real.” Opening and closing lines book-end voice and stakes cleanly; no typographic or tense inconsistencies.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: sentences layer metaphor, memory, and motion without paraphrase loops. Figurative bursts cluster near lightning beats, pattern-taught by storm flicker, paying off in mist-writing coda. Minor scaffold: “counting seconds into meaning” echoes prior “counting syllables into truth,” but the reprise is purposeful, reweighting craft itself. Filter verbs nearly zero; strong verbs drive momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: single sentences fuse external action with philosophical import (“each movement a thesis”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—sundial shadows as epistemic revelation—without purple overload. Occasional elevated diction (“epistemic,” “calcified”) fits professor POV; register remains internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds later symbolism, e.g., "rusted iron beams forming a skeletal cage" forecasts closure image. Metaphors stay coherent (library as cathedral, moon as silver) and sparse enough not to clot urgency. No paraphrase loops; strong verbs ("clutched," "poured," "greet") limit modifiers. One minor scaffold: "they worked... still working, still talking" repetition could trim, but it occurs early and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; no scaffold. High density: “compasses on his music stand began their familiar flickering dance” marries object, motion, and foreshadow in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent—tide of clouds behaves like tide, not random water. Rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentence on colors balanced by fragment “This was the moment.” Only micro-flaw: “a gift” and “somehow felt honest” edge toward abstraction, but immediately grounded by sensory follow-ups. No artifact penetrates closure; final line “Elias played on” lands clean, monosyllabic, ear-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; no loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is patterned—color, scent, spiral—teaching the reader early. Occasional elevated register (“crystalline moment of doubt”) is earned by elevated stakes. Final clause “empirical whimsy and found it sufficient” risks self-conscious cleverness but lands inside Mira’s professional idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm ebbs and surges like post-storm breeze; sentences vary from 5-word fragments to 35-word coils without pattern fatigue. Figurative language is selective—needle like unanswered questions, lace like secret in water—never stacked. One paraphrase loop: “the color of unspoken apologies” appears twice; trimmed one would raise density. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information yield.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“bruised purple,” “golden fingerprint,” “kindled humility”—each phrase advancing character or theme. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor slip: “preprocess reality into neat equations and predictable trajectories” slightly edges toward abstract summary, but it’s immediately grounded by the physical contrast of the trembling butterfly. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line: “frost creep across the stone in delicate crystalline veins” merges setting, mood, and motif. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with thought. Minor overwriting in “luminous art had always been about capturing light” risks abstraction, but it’s quickly grounded in concrete sculpture. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (silence as measurable, emotion as heat) and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold appears in “moments so emotionally potent that they left permanent thermal fingerprints”—a slight paraphrase of earlier mapping—but doesn’t dull closure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence, and the final line (“waiting for someone to remember how to listen”) perfectly echoes the opening’s musical notation motif.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sand that smelled of salt despite coming from nowhere near the coast” does setting, mystery, and character in one. Sentence rhythm varies effectively—longer underwater, clipped at threshold moments. Minor artifact: “translucent and confused” slightly leans on stock phrasing, but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (lens knitting together like healing bone), never muddled in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “water eventually carves stone” conveys method, metaphor, and character in one phrase. Minor scaffold in “gently persistent” repetition (used three times), but justified as motif. No paraphrase loops or register drift; figurative language remains coherent (bell as voice, gardens as lab). Final paragraph’s cadence builds momentum without overwriting—though “stubborn, gently persistent act” slightly redundancies earlier phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “grief so profound it left a signature of salt on her tongue” merges taste, emotion, and metaphor cleanly. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with scene intensity. Minor overwriting in “liquid pearl into waiting palms”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“unused love found its way home”) avoids sentimentality through concrete verbs (“flowing,” “transforming”).

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the visible world a temporary arrangement of atoms too polite to mention their imminent departure” exemplifies high information density. Figurative language is consistent (time as origami, breath as temporal vessel) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “something that might have been fear or might have been anticipation”—a slight hedging loop—but it doesn’t dull closure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports emotional cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“chains were part of her disguise, symbols of the captivity the regime still claimed to maintain”). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—dust motes “dancing like memories,” air carrying “green scent of dormant potential”—without purple excess. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; paragraph cuts serve emotional and tactical shifts. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-text, but closure beat remains unblemished and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “aurora was bleeding red tonight, a sound like pages tearing slowly in an empty library” does triple duty—setting, character, theme. No loops, no scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative language is coherent (sound = color = memory) and peaks without muddle. Final line (“She smiled, just slightly, and returned to her work”) lands with earned restraint, avoiding sentimentality while carrying immense emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and theme. Minor overwriting in “liquid silver” and “luminous disbelief” slightly strains the read-aloud rhythm, but not enough to blur sense. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One near-paraphrase: “borrowed from fate’s gallery” and “reinterpretation” echo closely, but the latter evolves into action. Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is nearly flawless: high information density, varied sentence openings, and rhythmic control that breathes with the scene’s emotional arc. One minor overwriting slip: “weighty lightness” appears twice within close proximity, risking redundancy. Figurative language is pattern-taught (ice/glacier metaphors for emotional barriers) and pays off cohesively at closure. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. The final paragraph’s parallelism (“cracked leather and cooling glass…”) is purposeful, not templated.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “stars humming through the shattered skylight” merges sound, image, and mood. Figurative language is purposeful (“moonlight poured… like spilled milk”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “tide against rock” simile, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“voice as her own, waiting to be born”) resonates without redundancy. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., break before “Daniel advanced”).

    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“The pebble-shore oracle stood…”, “She had walked…”, “The storm paused…”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (silence summarized, darkness mapped). Minor overwriting in “flaking gold leaf booklet that had survived three wars and a drowning”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure closure. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“Her work began”) lands with earned weight. No artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “frost-sounds,” “geometries that should not exist,” “amalgamate from many iterations” all do double duty in atmosphere and theme. Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“recursive loop of awareness that shattered the illusion…”) slightly blurs propulsion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence shift—longer, resonant sentences—perfectly mirrors thematic acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (glass, mirrors, light) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“water droplets still trembling on the glass surfaces like held tears”) edges toward purple, but the metaphor pays off in the closing refractions. No loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks; information density remains high without sacrificing clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “sap stains from decades of coaxing life from reluctant soil” conveys history, labor, and relationship in one phrase. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—each line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (“luck became measurable… like rainfall or soil acidity”) and payoff-bound. Final line’s cadence (“waiting to unfold for whoever took the time…”) recharges the maze motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful: sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is selective and coherent (wings as book pages, time moving sideways). High information density—each line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. One paraphrase loop: “subdued awakenings” appears twice in close proximity without added pressure. Also, “mechanically warm” is repeated three times; while thematic, the third instance edges toward label-only reinforcement. No scaffold or momentum drag, but these micro-redundancies prevent a 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the grand hall resembled a sinking cathedral, its gilded balconies reflected in black water that moved with silent patience”). Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in one metaphor (“water damage spread like living things”) slightly strains logic, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“leaving the lanterns to flicker in the darkness below”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mouth tasted like copper and regret” merges sensory and emotional in one stroke. Figurative language is purposeful—the aurora as “pale grief,” frost as “branching rivers”—and never muddles clarity. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “swaying in the wind but still standing, still reporting,” which borders on redundant. Otherwise, every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot; paragraph cuts are sharp; rhythm varies naturally. Final line’s cadence (“her heart finally light enough to do its work”) lands with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“brick walls weeping decades of groundwater” establishes setting and decay). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (valve beads = prayer beads); no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“oppressive atmosphere of the place”) that briefly slows momentum mid-ghost shift.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “vines threaded through collapsed shelves” conveys ecology, history, and tone). Minor overwriting in “regenerative silence… like waves upon a shore that rebuilt the beach” risks mixed metaphor, but it’s controlled. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or theme. Final line resonates without redundancy, though one or two modifiers edge toward thesaurus-itis (“methodical grace”).

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“honeyed, surreal quality,” “silence like an unanswered question”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror emotional cadence. One minor flaw: “fragile and necessary” slightly borders on abstract pairing, but it’s redeemed by immediate tactile grounding. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure beat is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (“concrete walls still bearing the faint smell of wheat despite decades of conversion”), rhythmic variation, and zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is precise (“shadows that crawled instead of fell”) and never muddled. Final paragraph’s cadence shifts subtly toward hope without sentimentality. One minor slip: “bronze quiet” slightly risks abstraction, but context grounds it in sensory atmosphere. No artifacts obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.6)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density (“hands…crumbled fortune cookie wrappers into the same precise folds”), varied sentence openings, and purposeful paragraph breaks. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image pulls double duty (microdots ↔ fortunes, tide ↔ current of fate). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (“white finger,” “paths of least resistance,” “transposed into a new key”) and never muddles clarity. Final line’s cadence—“illuminating the dark while leaving everything else in familiar shadow”—resonates with opening, closing the loop with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but propulsive, with high information-per-line: “decorated the sanctuary with silence” conveys action, philosophy, and setting in five words. Figurative language is coherent (chant as “eternal return,” silence as fabric), though slightly elevated in peak beats (“brighter and more terrible than absence”)—justified by POV. Minor scaffold in “his true work, the investigation of thresholds” (redundant appositive), but no loops or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates appropriately, driving toward the threshold without blurring cause.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“ink made from memories she hadn't yet lived”). Figurative language is coherent—glass, ice, music, and spiral motifs interlock without contradiction. Minor overwriting appears in the opening paragraph (“crystalline song,” “blur the boundary”), but it’s pattern-taught and pays off in the spire’s dissolution. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, though one adjacent paraphrase (“perpetually out of reach… always present”) slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language (“pulsing faintly as if remembering the water”) is coherent and sustained, not muddled. Minor scaffold in “periodically eternal, flickering across centuries like a candle seen through wind”—the simile slightly dilutes the original metaphor—but it doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, synonym churn, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally. Final line’s propulsion (“the ripples would spread outward in patterns she could finally control”) crystallizes momentum without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (“numbness that settled into her bones like cold stone”), varied sentence openings, and purposeful rhythm. Figurative language is consistent (hush as membrane, music as tide) without muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. The final paragraph’s cadence—“The filament of hush remained inside her, but it no longer隔离—it sang”—resolves the core metaphor with syntactic precision, though the stray Chinese character “隔离” is a minor copyediting lapse that slightly dulls the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs and selective sensory detail. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Minor flaw: “credibly curious mind turning over the implications like a stone in a stream” leans slightly toward mixed metaphor (mind as water? hands?).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “scents carried tears in their molecular structure” fuses science and emotion. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs shift length to mirror tension. Minor overwriting in “ghostly fluorescence of memories embedded in organic matter”—slightly abstract—but quickly grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; every image serves escalation or closure. Final line’s “enduring weight of caring deeply” risks abstraction but is earned by preceding concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose exhibits high information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme without scaffold or loop. Figurative language is controlled and coherent—starlight as “threads,” time as “folded, layered, simultaneous”—with no mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies naturally, paragraph lengths create visual cadence, and sentence openings avoid monotony. The only minor slip: “fragments of what time felt like from the inside” slightly edges toward abstraction, but it’s immediately grounded by “trying to translate that sensation into words.” No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “chronic hush,” “echo-harbor violinist,” and “mendicant’s bowl” each do thematic, character, and atmospheric work. Figurative language is purposeful (“hand reaching from a well”) without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-zero scaffolding. Every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere—e.g., “ethanol and old secrets” conveys setting, profession, and moral ambiguity in four words. Figurative language is consistent (amber, static, furniture of the interior) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the middle paragraph (“experience was the pretense… experience was the truth”), but no loops, redundancies, or register drift. Final line’s cadence perfectly mirrors the story’s cyclical, suspended closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ships finding their harbor by starlight” echoes the inverted ship shelves and Maren’s profession without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “interrupted cadence troubled her deeply… something was stealing the city's rhythm, cage by cage”). Figurative language is consistent (sound as caged, time as borrowed fabric) and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “she packed… she followed… she climbed” sequence, but forgiven for rhythmic intent. Final paragraph avoids summary, closing on concrete action: documenting sounds. No loops or purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“the fruit... became, for just a moment, a question she could not answer”).

Minor deduction only for one slightly over-modified phrase (“circuitously sincere as always”).

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density: "water had carved temporary rivers through the cracked earth" conveys ecology, history, and hope in one phrase. Figurative language is purposeful ("congregation" of pools, "stubbornness" of pillars) without overload. Minor scaffold in "feeling the cool metal in her palms, lifting it to her eye"—slightly redundant—but quickly redeemed by the crystalline focus payoff. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors release: short clauses, then the long exhale of "closed her eyes and finally let go."

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph lengths sculpting breath and emphasis. One minor slip: “small miracle of patience and pressure” uses “miracle” untranslated from Chinese (奇迹), briefly disrupting flow—but it’s isolated and doesn’t dull closure. Otherwise, zero loops, no scaffold, no purple prose; metaphors cohere (sound as weather, future as country/garden).

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “salt crystals still clung to his notebooks” conveys history, profession, and atmosphere in six words. Figurative language is sparse and precise (harbor “empty and waiting, but no longer absent”).

Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the climax (“vast and terrifying absence that every mortal feared…” edges toward abstraction). No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies naturally. Final line’s beauty is slightly undercut by near-cliché phrasing (“hellos in a language older than stars”), preventing a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“read people like ledgers,” “deathly vitality”) and never muddled. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each idea builds.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“electricity’s heartbeat,” “compressed histories… like rings inside… bonsai trunks”—but avoids overwriting through grounded specificity.

Final line achieves propulsion and resonance without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density—e.g., “the world filtered differently, as though reality had developed a transparency”—that advances character, theme, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is pattern-taught (tides as breath, containers as skyscrapers) and pays off at closure. Minor scaffold in the middle paragraph (“Conversations caught… became bricks”) slightly flattens momentum, but no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. Final line crystallizes the rhythm without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “dead eyes” for windows, “ephemeral compass” as metaphor, “closing pages” for wind—all advance atmosphere or theme. Sentence openings vary (“Inside, the observatory...”; “When she brushed...”; “She would leave...”), and paragraph lengths create rhythmic breath. One minor flaw: “busted myth” slightly jars register amid otherwise elevated diction. No loops or scaffolding; every line pulls double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“glass platforms gleamed like floating diamonds,” “music shifted… matching her heartbeat”). Figurative language is purposeful, not decorative, and avoids mixed metaphors.

Sentence openings vary (“Mira set up…”, “The object…”, “She positioned…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence—e.g., the shift to Yusuf’s memory deepens motivation without stalling momentum. One minor slip: “methodical precision of someone who understood…” slightly abstracts, but it’s redeemed by the concrete “permanent marks in the regolith” that follows. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“Mist clung… like a second skin” establishes tone and setting in one stroke). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (water refraction as braille; mist as liminal veil). No paraphrase loops or scaffold—every image serves the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “kelp curtains,” “sunken cathedral,” “tenderness of a lover’s farewell” each advance atmosphere, character, and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“copperlight repose,” “stone in his chest,” “threading a labyrinth with his own story”—but avoids overwriting by anchoring metaphors in physical action. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional escalation. One minor flaw: slight redundancy in “sustained impossibilities” phrasing across two paragraphs, but it serves thematic echo rather than loop. Final line (“refusing to let them end”) delivers propulsion and closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“trees bore fruit that glowed with imprisoned light” establishes setting and theme in one stroke). Figurative language is pattern-taught (ash, light, venom) and pays off at closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “shyly unstoppable,” “blossom armistice,” and “reef-shadow joy” risk stacking modifiers without sufficient grounding. One paraphrase loop: “becoming tendrils, becoming roots, becoming the blossom armistice” uses repetitive structure for effect, but borders on scaffold. Sentence openings vary well; rhythm supports emotional arc. Final paragraph accelerates effectively, though “proof that beauty can grow from even the longest wait” edges toward summative telling.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and concrete nouns (“decorated,” “tracking,” “revitalized”). However, adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase: “hope required rigorous methodology rather than mere sentiment” and “hope could be understood and enhanced through systematic investigation” echo without deepening.

    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (“silence that gathered like rust”) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “crystalline melodies that had been fading since midnight had stolen the light” slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors dawn’s arrival—gradual, luminous, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “the needle hung suspended not quite true north” conveys object state, thematic disorientation, and narrative direction in one phrase. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary organically. Figurative language is coherent (petrichor as “ghost,” lagoon as “cathedral”) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “architecture of stone” beat, but closure image (“resonant hush… embraced her”) remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“ocean’s vocabulary,” “timewoven alliance”) and pays off. Minor density risk in mid-story (“woven, strands of light and shadow forming scenes that layered over one another like sediment”) slightly slows momentum, but clarity holds. Final paragraph’s rhythm echoes storm’s hum—propulsive and resonant. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: sentences vary in length and structure, paragraphs breathe with thematic rhythm, and every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. High information density—e.g., “frost-etched glass… transformed them into something new and strange”—does triple duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One borderline overwriting moment (“colors that seemed to pulse with their own heartbeat”) risks purple prose, but remains anchored in POV. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes had called to her for thirty years” establishes voice and stakes immediately. Figurative language is purposeful (“patient whale,” “insect trapped in amber”) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “unsung history settling into her bones” / “forgotten chapter” slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Final paragraph’s cadence shift—short, declarative clauses—heightens closure without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “lanterns ignited without flame, burning with the amber glow of pure memory” does setting, theme, and causality in one image. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (amber = memory, bottle = paradox). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Final line crystallizes the arc without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “amber light through a window left ajar” does triple duty (image, metaphor, thematic echo). Sentence openings vary (“The foghorn’s…”, “As the last…”, “She climbed…”), avoiding template cadence. One minor flaw: “expectation悬在半空” inserts untranslated Chinese mid-sentence—an untaught artifact that briefly obscures clarity, though context salvages meaning. Otherwise, zero loops, no scaffold, high information density. Final line (“heard the dead keep their word”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“frost-numbed palm,” “ink faded to weak tea”). Figurative language is pattern-taught early (time as river, entropy as disorder) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“storms contained in stillness”) slightly dulls momentum, but closure remains sharp. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, and every image serves theme or pressure—no scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is restrained but potent (“siren rose like a dawn,” “solstice hush settled like a held breath”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm shifts naturally with scene needs. Minor deduction for slight overuse of atmospheric metaphor in the middle third, but never at the expense of clarity or propulsion. Final paragraph’s cadence—timestamp, glue held, switch worked, rain falls—delivers closure with elegant economy.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“amber surface catching the dawn like captured sunlight”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentences vary in structure and length, matching the janitor’s meditative pace. Minor overwriting in “residue of speed and fire and longing” (three abstractions stacked), but forgiven by immediate grounding in action. Final paragraph’s cadence (“profound strength... quiet fire... sacred importance”) resonates without redundancy. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere or character.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light, glass, weight) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “bodies formed from fragments of gold and amber and something that might have been honey itself”—slightly strained—but doesn’t obscure meaning. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm supports thematic accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, varied sentence structure, and purposeful repetition (“borrowed hours,” “broken time capsule”) create propulsion without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent and physically grounded (e.g., time as “wounded birds” in a sanctuary). Minor overwriting appears in one beat (“equations that no longer resolved into anything comprehensible, their answers twisting into new shapes”), slightly diluting momentum, but never obscures causality or dulls the closure. Final paragraph achieves perfect cadence and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“cobalt lagoon,” “bottle-green,” “woven dawns”) and pays off without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; syntax varies naturally. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic acceptance—unhurried, open-ended—without sacrificing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “copper wire… mimicked the spiraling growth of vine tendrils” conveys method, purpose, and aesthetic in one phrase. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor artifact: “braze of calm” likely intends “blaze” but reads as typo, momentarily disrupting immersion. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Final line’s “subtle music… gratitude” lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density and rhythmic control, though occasional figurative stacking (“frozen river of stone,” “restless spirits,” “metallic tones that seemed to glow from within”) risks mild overwriting in mid-text. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “chemistry of homecoming” appears twice with minimal variation, creating a faint echo. Closure remains sharp, but this slight redundancy prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph lengths creating visual cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“submerged concord of some forgotten treaty between life and death” edges toward abstraction—but quickly grounded by tactile follow-up. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; however, one run of elevated diction (“resurrection that only those who understand bird calls…”) slightly drifts from the coachman’s likely register, costing full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“grooves that held secrets beyond music, text embedded in sound waves like messages bottled in glass”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (wax preservation, wounds, translation). Minor scaffold in “wild hush” repetition, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports emotional cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—“heartbeat of a thousand calculations,” “blade of light”—without muddle. Minor redundancy appears in “stretched hours… temporally stretched… perception stretched thin,” but this echoes the motif intentionally. No scaffold loops; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors earned stasis: calm, resolved, yet forward-looking.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, openings avoid repetition, and paragraphs cut for emotional charge. Figurative language is purposeful (“secrets like trapped birds,” “grey of winter dawn”) without muddle. One minor loop: “sky was wrong today” appears twice across versions, but the second is intentional revision, not redundancy. Final lines land cleanly—no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift. High information density with zero fat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density, varied sentence rhythms, and zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is precise and consistent (“nomadic penumbra,” “lighthouse in the dark”) without muddle or overwriting. Every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme—e.g., “tourniquets were applied to herself” conveys transformation in six words. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“The chessboard waited. The gallery listened.”) creates propulsion through brevity, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “mercury-glass seer,” “digestive tract of knowledge,” and “feather against her glass fingertips” each convey character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully—long, winding sentences for the labyrinth; clipped phrases for visions—and paragraph cuts heighten emotional beats (e.g., the stone’s glow fading before the keeper speaks). No loops or scaffold: every sentence advances pressure, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (mountain as throat, bookstore as digestive tract) and peaks without muddle; the final line’s “long road home” resonates without redundancy. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the seventh-night summary, but closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “breath rising in delicate curls despite the stillness that hung over everything like a suspended spell” establishes rhythm without overwriting. Figurative language is coherent (amber of stopped time, thunder holding its breath) and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “always twisting, always arranging, always finding” slightly flattens immediacy, but this is offset by strong verbs (“winnowed,” “decoding,” “foreclose”). Final paragraph’s cadence shifts effectively to stillness without slackening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist curl between the other towers like breath held too long” does atmosphere, character, and foreshadowing in one. Sentence variety mirrors tension—long, sinuous clauses for reflection; short, stark phrases for decision (“No more”). Zero paraphrase loops; every image recurs with reweighted meaning (spire, mist, bone). Only minor deduction: slight overuse of metaphor in opening paragraph risks density, but payoff justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor figurative density in the climax (“light entered through the cracks”) borders on familiar, but earns its place through concrete grounding in the statue’s fractures. One slight paraphrase loop: “not repairing what was broken, but understanding that the breaking was the point” echoes earlier phrasing, but serves thematic cadence. Otherwise, zero scaffold, strong verbs, vivid nouns, and clean syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in “cathedral walls” and “theater with no actors” slightly dilutes propulsion, but figurative language remains coherent. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—“carrying with him the memory of water holding light”—with zero artifacts muddying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, each sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful (“fever” for heat, “wounded stars” for flares) and never muddled. No loops or scaffold—every image serves the accumulative pressure. The final line (“the darkness had answered them back”) pays off the opening’s “bruised clouds” with resonant inversion, proving information density and propulsion coexist. Minor deduction only for slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-text, but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Syntax varies purposefully—long, flowing sentences for landscape; short, rough clauses for dialogue. One minor loop: “grief” appears in similar constructions (“currents of grief,” “geography of loss”) but with escalating specificity, so not penalized heavily. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; metaphors are coherent (navigation, tides, maps). Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the story’s arc: certainty, then shared uncertainty, then resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-perfect information efficiency: “Her mouth had become an open wound, bleeding sincerity no one wanted to receive” conveys character, conflict, and cost in one image. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—the orchard “suspended between destruction and renewal” echoes Mira’s psyche without overstatement. Sentence openings vary rhythmically, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and every detail serves multiple functions. Only minor density in the second paragraph’s conceptual layering slightly risks abstraction, but it’s anchored by the visceral “open wound” metaphor, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (e.g., “golden eye blinking,” “borrowed memories settling like tide marks”). Minor overwriting in “softly persistent waves” slightly dilutes impact, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. The only artifact: “witnessed isolation” in the final paragraph edges toward label-speak, though it’s quickly grounded in the lighthouse-as-gathering-place metaphor. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“walls seemed to breathe,” “paper remembered”) and coherent within the story’s logic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in the blooming cavern description (three successive floral images), but none obscure clarity or dull the closure. Final paragraph propels without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, each sentence advancing atmosphere or character. Minor overwriting in “lacy menace of the place settled around her shoulders like a cape made of spiderwebs and threat”—mixed metaphor slightly muddles. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, and figurative language coheres (starlight as liquid, breath as fog). Final image (“lacy patterns of light weaving through the dark like promises kept”) is earned, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the fire’s pulse. Figurative language is pattern-taught (spiral = memory = friendship) and payoff-rich. Only two micro-slips: “scientifically romantic investigation” slightly label-like, and “accumulated heat into the cooling air” borders on redundant—but neither dulls closure. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with cadence mirroring ember crackle and whispered intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but controlled, with high information density: “lighthouse that illuminates only the rocks waiting to destroy you” does thematic, imagistic, and character work. Minor overwriting appears in one beat (“feral nostalgia rising… like something wild and caged”), but it’s voice-motivated and doesn’t obscure clarity. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with emotional cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line (“This is my grave, learning to speak”) recharges the scroll motif with perfect propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fog pressed against the windows like something wanting in” establishes atmosphere and thematic pressure in one stroke. Sentences vary rhythmically, balancing short declaratives (“She could not taste it”) with flowing clauses. Minor overwriting in “invisible things” (slightly vague) and one near-redundancy (“patience more than skill… plenty of patience”), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “ordinary miracle” risks cliché but is redeemed by concrete grounding in the screw’s warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “a gray wall of waiting thunder that pressed against the world like a held breath” establishes tone and stakes in one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (crystallization, breath, scars) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in “shed memories” slightly dilutes the diamond metaphor, but the final stroke—“runes held—luminous and perfect”—lands with clarity. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: every image serves character or stakes (e.g., “chainsaws sleep in trucks” foreshadows violence). Figurative language is consistent (orchard as memory, currents as connection) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “fleeting contacts, stuttering connections” slightly dulls momentum, but rhythm accelerates effectively toward the chainsaw’s cough. Final line’s “sharp, clean break” crystallizes theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and largely free of loops or scaffold. Sentences do multiple jobs—establishing setting, advancing mood, revealing character. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“deeper into the library's heart and further along its outermost perimeter” / “walked outward… while simultaneously journeying deeper”), creating mild redundancy. Figurative language is consistent, though slightly overused in the final paragraph, risking opacity without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“silence… holding its breath,” “razor edges of clarity”) is controlled and purposeful. Minor overwriting in “measuring itself against itself in an endless conversation” risks abstraction, but it’s grounded by tactile context. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph propels cleanly to closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information per line (“fungal light revealed connections invisible to ordinary sight”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “revolutionary act of creating connection through the precise maintenance of separation” edges toward abstraction, slightly dulling immediacy. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, paragraph lengths sculpt tension, and concrete verbs (“hovering,” “pulsed,” “cracked”) anchor abstractions. No loops or scaffold; the final image (“quiet wildfire”) earns its lyricism through prior fungal imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“water streaked the tall windows like slow tears”) and varied rhythm, though one minor loop appears: “probability bent and something impossible became real” slightly echoes earlier phrasing about exceptions to rules. No scaffold or synonym churn; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (light as honesty, risk as coastline) and never muddles causality. Final paragraph’s cadence shift elevates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.4)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally—paragraph lengths shift, sentence openings diversify. Figurative language is coherent (grief as frequency, tunnel as artery) and pattern-taught early. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; even elevated phrases (“cultivated estrangement”) feel earned. Final line’s stark simplicity delivers propulsion without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose demonstrates high information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, and atmosphere simultaneously (“she had been afraid... that proximity would reveal flaws... But... the photo only grew richer”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (tea-steeping, photographic development), never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally with paragraph length and sentence structure. Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-text (e.g., “gentle pressure of what had been lost and the quiet hope of what might be recovered” edges toward abstraction), but closure remains unblemished.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—longer, weary clauses early; shorter, clearer phrasing at climax. Minor artifact: “desperately jocular” edges toward label-speak, but is immediately dramatized in dialogue, avoiding penalty escalation. No loops, scaffold, or purple prose; final line (“like a promise kept”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “cool metal drink in the whispered histories” merges touch, sound, and memory in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (roots drawing water, stars holding breath) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“quiet blaze that burned without consuming”) risks abstraction but pays off in closure. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph lengths mirroring cognitive shifts. Minor scaffold in “She did not mind the assignment” followed by explanation, but quickly recovers. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is coherent (bending/filtering/breath motif). The only slight bloat is in the reflective block about her grandfather, but it’s anchored by the pen and alters her present stance, avoiding momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language (“water into shattered silver,” “moonlight thickening”) is coherent and pattern-taught, never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “rhythm that runs beneath all speaking and all forgetting”—a rare abstract phrase amid otherwise concrete imagery. Final line’s em-dash propulsion perfectly resolves the opening’s tension.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“threads of gold and copper that had dulled,” “scratched out violently”—and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One slight overwriting moment: “passion for the forgotten and destroyed burning bright enough to illuminate what others might have missed” risks abstraction, but it’s grounded immediately by tactile action. Final line’s rhythm (“without having to burn down the gates”) delivers closure with syntactic grace. No scaffold or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (sound = water = light) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “vomiting stars” risks purple prose but is earned by context. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Final line (“Mira smiled”) lands with quiet force, avoiding exposition. One near-paraphrase (“entangled memories… theirs. Hers and Mira’s”) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “steel groaned in fog,” “whispers passed… like mycelium through soil” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphor in character expertise. Sentence openings vary (“She unfolded,” “Below her,” “The storm raged”), paragraph lengths breathe with scene rhythm, and every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—“folded and refolded so many times their creases had softened to cloth” compresses history into texture. Final line (“descended into the maze to continue her work”) echoes the opening’s devotion without redundancy, closing the cadence loop cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“spiralingly calm, like water finding its level”) and coherent within the light/shadow motif. Minor overwriting in “mathematics of pain” leans slightly toward abstraction, but it’s grounded by physicality (“slope of his shoulders”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, though one adjacent paraphrase (“patience was its own kind of language” / “patience of someone who simply stayed”) costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every sentence advances theme, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“silence became its own kind of language”) and consistent—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “magnetic grotto under starlight drew things together—not by force, but by the gravity of unspoken intention” risks abstraction, but is redeemed by immediate embodiment (“cradle those fragmented feelings like wounded birds”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is masterful but bears faint overwriting in two high-pressure beats: “fierce gentleness of a creature that had survived the deep pressures of the ocean, that had learned to move through resistance with surrender” slightly stacks modifiers, and “bioluminescence and ancient song” verges on ornamental. Otherwise, sentences propel momentum, vary rhythm, and multitask (e.g., “The scrimshaw had become a touchstone, something to hold when the world's cruelty seemed absolute” conveys object, emotion, and backstory). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image serves closure. Minor deduction prevents 9+ per artifact guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict (“turbines hum their endless note” implies both sound and ideological machinery). Figurative language is consistent (“curl spirals free like a falling thought”) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies with scene needs. Final line (“defiantly blank”) resolves by recharging the central motif with devastating simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“winter light broke against the frozen lake like fractured glass”), yet avoids overwriting through rhythmic variation and concrete verbs. Sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. One minor flaw: the phrase “tremor of certainty” borders on abstract label, though it’s quickly grounded in bodily sensation. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is restrained yet potent (“smoke from the phoenix’s rising,” “language of leaves and petals”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the story’s cadence. Minor scaffold appears in “she had bartered awakenings…”—a slight explanatory dip—but it’s brief and anchored in present action. No loops, purple prose, or register drift; the final lines achieve propulsion without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.7)
    Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—no scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is precise and consistent: light “fragments,” echoes “hum,” courage pools “like liquid.” Sentence openings vary (“In the laboratory…”, “Her task…”, “Unlike the synthetic lenses…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the contemplative pace. The final line’s cadence (“prepared to receive it”) resolves the musical motif established in “prism-song bell ringer” without overwriting. Zero loops, mixed metaphors, or filter-verb stacks dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“hollowed out and scattered like crushed pearls,” “starlight poured through windows draped with... curtains of intention”—but avoids overwriting by tethering metaphors to character perspective. Sentence openings vary (“She had arrived,” “The tattoo stencil,” “Tonight, a new arrival”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor slip: “subdued ardor visible in the gentle concern” borders on abstract labeling, though immediately grounded by action. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “the deck worn smooth by three generations of hands” conveys history, inheritance, and use in one phrase. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the scene’s rhythm. Minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the opening (“sanctuary of soft, refracted light”) borders on purple, but it’s quickly grounded by concrete action. No loops, no scaffold, no artifacts—every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “luminescent dust motes caught in a draft, swirling in spirals that matched nothing in the physical world” edges toward ornamental abstraction. Still, most lines multitask—“saffron veil billowing” conveys character, setting, and motion. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the dance, and the final paragraph’s cadence delivers closure without redundancy. One minor paraphrase loop (“not capture but release, not analysis but acceptance, not control but surrender”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but doesn’t obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“petals glowing with stored memory,” “shadows dispersed entirely into light”). Zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is coherent (dreams as seeds, library as cathedral). Minor overwriting in “terrible beauty” slightly strains metaphor, but closure beat (“quietly luminous way”) avoids purple prose. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional rhythm. Information density high: stone’s warmth implies memory, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control: sentences vary in length and structure to mirror emotional cadence (e.g., short staccato phrases during tool use vs. flowing clauses in reflection). Figurative language is coherent (“glass—transparent and believing themselves strong”) and payoff-driven. One minor loop: “rebuilding something small and true” echoes earlier phrasing without added pressure. Otherwise, zero scaffold, no mixed metaphors, and closure image remains luminous and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (frost, rings, roots) and pays off at closure without muddle. Minor artifact: slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-story, but rhythm remains varied and propulsion strong. Final line (“watching her begin again”) recharges the dawn motif with earned resonance—no paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language (“quiet violence of hushed thunder,” “love… grown heavy with the weight of its own unmaking”) that avoids muddle through consistent tactile logic. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor paraphrase loop: “unused love” appears three times in close proximity, slightly diluting impact. Otherwise, high information density—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme—and the final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution without scaffold or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is masterful but not flawless. Sentences vary in length and structure to match emotional tempo, and imagery is largely coherent (stardust, ice cracking, water rising). However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “brass teeth bite into her palm” verges on mixed metaphor (teeth suggest organic aggression, brass is inert), and “unwritten calendar of her mind” borders on abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “perpetual twilight where the edges of things blurred and nothing held its shape” could be tighter. Closure remains undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “bioluminescent moss that had learned to grow where the trees had failed” conveys ecology, history, and adaptation in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (light as memory, archive as uncollapsed possibility) and never muddled in peak beats. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional valence. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks—every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. The final sentence’s cadence (“note by phosphorescent note”) perfectly echoes the theme of incremental healing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (e.g., “questions themselves had grown teeth and memory”). Figurative language is coherent—mechanical metaphors stay within established logic (gears, springs, rust). Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“bronze ferns and copper canopies, humming with the frequency of probable miracles”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold mar clarity. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—unhurried, resonant, conclusive.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “valleys of memory and across bridges of intention”—slightly abstract for an otherwise concrete piece. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one instance of elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing) risks register drift. Closure beat remains unblemished.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“frostbitten hope,” “bronze dust”) and pays off in closure. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the middle paragraph where reflection borders on summary—but it’s anchored by the bolt cue and tilts his choice. No loops, no scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs (“darkened,” “creaked,” “humming”) and concrete nouns (“spiral stairs,” “brass buttons”).

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, varied sentence openings, and rhythmic control support the Accumulative lens. Figurative language is coherent (“dust motes drifted like memories,” “marble softening into organic curves”) and never muddled. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each image advances plot or theme. The final paragraph’s cadence slows to a resonant close, with “quiet, unstoppable power of exposed truth” earning its weight through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “corals turned bone-white beneath her like a cemetery of living structures” merges image, emotion, and specificity. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (reef as cemetery, maps as photographs) and never muddles peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence—breath-like, suspended—perfectly serves Charged Poise closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “toes curling against cold metal” conveys emotion, setting, embodiment. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with pacing. Minor overwriting in “thunderous serenity” risks abstraction but pays off as tonal anchor. No loops or scaffold; one near-paraphrase (“waiting was the hardest battle” / “lull felt so heavy”) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“pulsed,” “screaming,” “drifted”) and sensory layering. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One slight overwriting: “genetic script and ancient wisdom” edges toward abstraction in the final line, though it’s earned by context. Sentence variety supports momentum—short clauses during urgency, longer cadences in reflection. Closure image remains clear despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “the sky opened and took everything except her hands” conveys catastrophe economically. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (greenhouse as cathedral, grief as weather). Minor artifact: “somatic markers of the present anchored her more reliably than any abstract promise of recovery” edges toward diagnostic phrasing but is immediately grounded in soil/stem/air details. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances character or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“walls that breathed with salt and time,” “luminescence of her aching clarity”) yet maintains propulsion through rhythmic variation and strong verbs. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “fragmented reality pressed against her thoughts like fog against glass”) borders on overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Final line lands with resonant simplicity, avoiding purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “ephemeral patterns in spilled ink” does thematic, atmospheric, and plot work simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs (“hover,” “dissolve,” “consume”) and precise nouns (“wind-carved encampment,” “synthetic eyes”). Minor overwriting in “time moved like honey”—a familiar metaphor—but it’s earned by context. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or mystery. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose demonstrates high information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes (“footsteps echoing… like stones dropped into a frozen well” conveys sound, space, and emotional chill). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught—cold/stasis motifs recur without muddle. Minor overwriting in one beat (“each sentence a small apocalypse demolishing the mythology”) edges toward purple but pays off thematically. No paraphrase loops, scaffold sentences, or register drift; syntax varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure image (“silence shift… transforming from a shroud into a held breath”) is crystalline and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent—no mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor overwriting in “tranquil blaze of color burning against the sand” slightly strains the visual metaphor, but it serves the tone. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; rhythm varies naturally with paragraph length and syntactic structure. Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “rail spike grew warm against his thigh” conveys object, embodiment, and foreshadowing in seven words. Figurative coherence—sound/light/emotion synesthesia—never muddles causality. Minor overwriting in “feral lullaby sung by wild things who had forgotten why they sang” slightly strains metaphor but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“It stood,” “Morwen approached,” “The first night”).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is selective and coherent (“smile… sharp as a paper cut,” “clouds like gray whales”). Minor overwriting in “constellations of meaning she had spent thirty-two years refusing to name” slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates cleanly toward closure. Information density is high; no redundancies or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful: “meteor hush,” “time folded in on itself,” “firmament of her broken timeline” are fresh without being ornate. Sentences vary in length and structure, advancing plot and atmosphere simultaneously. One paraphrase loop: “haunted firmware” appears three times in close proximity without added pressure. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “firmament of her broken timeline” slightly strains physical logic. Still, momentum never stalls, and the final paragraph propels with earned lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist curl upward like something trying to remember what it once was” does triple duty (image, emotion, theme). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (wound, breath, residue). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Only minor density risk in peak beats (“ghost of centuries of confessions...”) but payoff justifies it. Final line’s “something that had been unlearning began, gently, to learn” resolves with earned lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme without redundancy. Figurative language is controlled—“water finding its path through scorched stone,” “empathy made unburnable”—and coheres within a consistent metaphor system (fire, stone, light). Minor risk in dense imagery during the renaming scene, but patterns are taught early (mosaic = language) and payoff justifies compression. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., transition from Lysara’s solitude to Soren’s arrival). Final image (“warmth of it was like holding an ember”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful—“edges of reality wore thin as old velvet curtains”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “fractured timeline upon fractured timeline layering like the sheets of a song never quite finished” slightly slows propulsion, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final line (“first lights of morning began to stir”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fractally precise display that defied random formation” does triple duty—description, character insight, thematic signal. Minor redundancy appears in “fractally precise” followed by “fractally precise display,” a slight paraphrase loop. Otherwise, rhythm supports escalation: staccato opening (“hummed,” “pressed,” “waited”) yields to fluid cadence in the climax. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “emotions crystallized into heat signatures that lingered in the rock itself like photographs made of warmth” merges metaphor, character ability, and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with intensity. Minor flaw: slight overwriting in “factually mystical” beat—two adjacent clauses (“not mystical… it was factually mystical”) verge on paraphrase-loop, though redeemed by conceptual payoff. Otherwise, zero scaffold, strong verbs, and precise nouns (“bioluminescent algae,” “tidal pool,” “mineral signatures”).

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, varied sentence openings, and purposeful paragraph lengths. Figurative language is controlled (“stone itself seemed to hold its breath,” “wisdom shared is wisdom multiplied”) and never muddles clarity. One minor slip: “quietly inspired” edges toward label-speak, though immediately grounded in action. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line lands with cadence and conceptual weight, recharging the opening’s “sacred quiet.”

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“mist wrapped around her like a shroud, silver and silent”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (silver hush, wind’s hushed tongues) and payoff-integrated. Minor scaffold in “her training asserted itself like muscle memory” borders on cliché, and “salvation mechanism” slightly jars as jargon. Otherwise, syntax varies purposefully, paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, and no loops or redundancies dull momentum. Final lines earn their lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “palimpsest whose original words had been scraped away but never truly erased” conveys history, loss, and persistence in one image). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (needle as distillation tool, fog as suspension). Minor deduction for slight overuse of figurative language in mid-story (“spindrift serenity,” “ancient passage”), but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.3)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“smoke… like a sigh that had lost its fire”) and coherent within the story’s tactile logic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for slight over-density in the middle paragraph (three successive metaphors about timelines), but none obscure clarity or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“red sigh,” “quivering hush”) is purposeful and consistent, never muddled. Minor deduction: “wistfully pragmatic” slightly edges toward label, though immediately grounded in action. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors oar strokes—breathing, unhurried—without syntactic monotony. Zero loops or scaffold; high information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is masterful, with high information density and varied sentence architecture. Figurative language is purposeful (“ghostly volumes floating past her ankles,” “wing beating against glass”) and consistent in its physics. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent clauses (“fragile, crystalline, a wing beating against glass—brittle in its clarity and its pain”), creating slight synonym churn, but it doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“waded… water now reaching her knees… hum rising… singing not in mourning but in welcome”) achieves perfect cadence without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere (“hoarding the small truths of longing in the vault of her memory”). Figurative language is coherent—spirals recur without contradiction—and rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in “massive lily pads that carpeted the pond held their dark green cups brimming with captured rainwater” slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final line’s cadence (“and so would she”) perfectly echoes the thrush’s renewal, closing the spiral with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“ethereal grit settled into her bones like a second skeleton”). Minor overwriting appears in one high-pressure beat (“subsonic waves riding beneath the normal broadcast, deliberately engineered to amplify distrust and division”)—slightly dense for immediate crisis. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence lands cleanly, though “silence ringing with possibilities” edges toward familiar phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“corridors spiraled where they should have straightened,” “origami made of shadow and silence”) is coherent and pattern-taught. Minimal scaffolding; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. One slight overwriting risk in “spatial mutiny” description, but clarity and propulsion remain intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: “stiffened silk like preserved skin” conveys texture, history, and emotional weight in six words. No loops, no scaffold—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully: opening languid, middle taut, ending breath-like. One minor slip: “lance through piles of stone” slightly clashes with later “lance through the fog” (Q9E), but the metaphor holds. Otherwise, flawless propulsion and concision.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Strong verbs (“pryed,” “crumbled,” “screaming”), specific nouns (“verdigris,” “palimpsest,” “jet stream”), and rhythmic variation create propulsion. One minor flaw: the phrase “spongey dread” appears twice, risking a paraphrase loop, though the second instance deepens its meaning. No filter-verb stacks, no syntactic monotony. The final image is sharp, resonant, and uncluttered—exactly what elite literary venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield (“worn leather split at the corners, held more than just instrument and bow; it held the particular silence…”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors; scaffold netting as “anxious birds” pays off in the closure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and verbs are strong (“bled,” “wound,” “fractured,” “sculpted”). One minor slip: “dissolveed” is likely a typo, but it doesn’t obscure meaning or harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “faded paint still whispering of adventures” merges image, sound, and history). Figurative language is pattern-taught (circus as ecosystem) and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold in “layered, nostalgic, a little sad” slightly over-modifies, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the gathering dusk—breathing, not drumming—and the foreign bill’s tactile return grounds abstraction in concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with high information density (“paper drink in the flower's golden residue,” “predictable chaos” of stars). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “shared burdens of knowledge were never meant for solitary scholars... they were meant to be witnessed together” restates the same idea. Figurative language is coherent (daylily = fleeting insight, stars = timekeepers), but “healing words” appears as label without embodiment. No scaffold or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “flesh-eating plant seed, harvested from the corpse of a man who had threatened the forest's children” does worldbuilding, character, and stakes in one clause. Figurative language is pattern-taught (ice = confession, seed = redemption) and payoff-earned. Minor artifact: “warlike serenity” appears twice, but the second use deepens meaning (from descriptor to philosophical stance), so no loop penalty. Final line’s “losing your grip on illusion” risks abstraction but is anchored by Kaelen’s physical smile.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: “cobalt glade,” “violet earth,” “amber resin” create immediate texture without overwriting. Sentence openings vary (“She had been planted,” “The future had arrived,” “She clutched”), and paragraph cuts align with emotional shifts. One minor flaw: “linking through scars” appears twice in close proximity with slight redundancy, but it’s thematically justified. Final beat avoids purple prose—“consciousness spilling out” remains grounded in the clipping’s planted form.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional figurative stacking (“wound in the world,” “paper flowers”) slightly risks overwriting in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Strong verbs (“trammel,” “inlaying,” “bartered”) avoid modifier crutches. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—cadence slows as Elara walks back, carrying “fierce gentleness” like a physical weight. Minor deduction for two adjacent metaphors in paragraph 2 that edge toward purple without dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, each sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or theme without slack. Figurative language (“silence that had swallowed him,” “facts insulating emotionally… like sound-dampening material”) is coherent and purposeful. Rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph lengths sculpting breath and tension. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; even elevated phrases (“confidently uncertain,” “charged poise”) feel earned by voice. Final line’s cadence—“sound never truly disappears, it only finds new places to echo”—resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “spine of silver and amber” conveys form, color, and mythic weight). Figurative language is coherent: magnetic forces, luminescence, and starlight pages build a consistent physics of transition. Minor overwriting in “pages so thin they seemed woven from starlight” borders on purple but serves closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates then resolves, matching emotional cadence—flawless except for one slightly ornate phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme without scaffold or loop. Figurative language is coherent (water/light/metal motifs interweave without contradiction) and purposeful—e.g., “metal liquefied... flowing like quicksilver” ties smelting to identity fluidity. Sentence openings vary organically; paragraph lengths mirror tidal ebb and flow. One minor slip: “the peace that comes from knowing one’s purpose” borders on abstract, but it’s immediately grounded by “gears” and “wintersun,” avoiding therapy-speak. No purple prose; modifiers serve specificity (“aged bone” straps, “salt-thick air”).

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “concrete corridors smelling of rust and resignation,” “pearl... swirling with colors that had no names.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as gathering, confession as fuel) and pays off at closure. Minor deduction: slight overuse of “radiance” variants in final third, but not enough to blur clarity or dull closure. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; rhythm varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivy that climbed the brick walls like green veins carrying life into old bones” does setting, metaphor, and theme in one stroke. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs shift length to mirror emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—each line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent (river/flood/bellows/ivy all share organic resilience motif) and never muddles peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“mist pooled against the library's marble steps like spilled memories”) and varied sentence openings. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (mist as memory, books as braille for dreaming) and paid off at closure (library as flower of pure language). Minor overwriting appears in “scientific precision” juxtaposed with “ancient recognition”—a slight register friction—but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every paragraph advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line crystallizes tone and theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “midsummer light passed through its crystal form like a secret wanting to be told” does triple duty (image, theme, object introduction). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent—light, perforation, frost recur with evolving meaning. Final line’s rhythm mirrors the first note: clean, resonant, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and dense, though occasional overwriting appears (“kaleidoscope of light and shadow that revealed itself only to those who knew how to look”). Minor scaffold in mid-section (“She had never spoken…”) slightly dulls momentum. No loops or register drift; final paragraph propels cleanly. Figurative coherence holds—aurora, static, and emerald weave consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with high information density—e.g., “storm clouds churned beneath like a restless gray sea” establishes setting, mood, and scale in one image. Minor overwriting in “vineyard hush of that impossible height” slightly strains metaphor coherence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm supports emotional arc. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the theme without redundancy, though “continuous, sacred act of arriving” edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—wind catching coat edges “like willing wings,” mirror shards throwing “fractured” truths—but avoids overwriting by anchoring metaphor in action (e.g., unhooking the pouch, listening to chimes). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and every line advances character or atmosphere. One minor slip: “sincerely insincere” borders on label-speak but is immediately grounded in behavior. No loops, scaffold, or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is precise, with high information density: “smooth as worry, dark as the space between stars” does triple duty (texture, emotion, cosmology). Rhythm modulates with scene—longer sentences for waiting, staccato for revelation. Minor overwriting in “truth woven carefully could not be rushed” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“She threw the stone…”) earns its lyricism through accumulated pressure, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (e.g., “wind had carved fossils into cathedrals”). Minor redundancy in “centuries of layered dust” appearing twice slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“slanting… golden shafts”) delivers perfect closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“spire held its breath,” “shed skin”) without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “light left fingerprints on the world”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“luminous vow,” “whispered promises”) and pays off in the climax. Minor overwriting in one beat (“saffron and violet threads weaving through the water”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final line (“messages in bottles made of fire”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “ambered deck caught the last light of the contracted cosmos” establishes setting, tone, and cosmology in one stroke. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Minor overwriting in “wavelength align with her purpose” slightly muddles metaphor, but it’s redeemed by immediate tactile grounding. No loops or scaffolding; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final sentence achieves perfect propulsion: “a patient person might finally understand” echoes and resolves the opening’s cosmic intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere (“shattered light streaming through cracks… like memories refusing to stay buried”). Figurative language is coherent (water/stones, light/rainbows, monsters/questions) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“creatures that had no names in any living language” slightly redundant after “sea monsters curling”) prevents 9.0+. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure beat remains artifact-free with clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “water from the morning dew was gathering, beginning to drip at irregular intervals” conveys setting, time, and method in one breath.

Figurative language (“magic ran lukewarm”) is consistent and payoff-ready, never muddling peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in “the carefully constructed silence that had kept its story submerged” slightly dilutes immediacy, but the figurative language is coherent (water as eraser, memory as salvage). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“some truths would not stay submerged…”) earns its lyricism through prior concrete buildup—no purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: metaphors (“starlings weaving like thoughts”) cohere within established logic. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats—e.g., “colors that had no names” slightly strains clarity—but doesn’t obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“The auburn-haired alchemist knelt…”, “Before the final transformation…”, “Mira had always…”). Final line’s propulsion (“frozen and waiting for the flame of wonder to set her free”) earns its lyricism through prior groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, varied, and purposeful: “static had swallowed every frequency” compresses dread efficiently; “clouds parted just enough” avoids overwriting. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with tension. One minor slip: “the language of wind and pressure, of temperature drops and gathering storms” slightly stacks prepositional phrases, but doesn’t blur sense. No loops, no scaffold—every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final image (“sentinel who had proven…”) lands with lyrical clarity, not sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful, with high information-per-line yield (“stones... etched with the names of masters who had trained here across centuries of shifting time”). Figurative language is coherent (floating rocks, upward-falling leaves) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the opening paragraph (“perpetual autumn twilight” borders on ornamental), but peak beats remain clear. Sentence variety supports emotional cadence, and paragraph cuts serve propulsion—no scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“moonlight fracture,” “origami nightmares”) and consistent.

One near-redundancy: “patient stillness” and “radical patience” in adjacent sentences, but the repetition serves thematic reinforcement, not sloppiness. Final paragraph’s cadence is masterful—propulsive yet meditative. Avoids overwriting despite lyrical tone; every image ties to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“mechanical resurrection,” “resonant space where sound bounced back upon itself”). A minor paraphrase loop exists in describing the lullaby’s function across two paragraphs. Sentence openings vary, rhythm supports mood, and information density is high—but the phrase “mournfully eager” borders on label-speak without sufficient embodied counterbalance. Still, line-level control remains strong, especially in the tactile handling of the pull cord and engine sounds.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, though occasional overwriting appears (“interiorized exteriors” risks obscurity). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor scaffold in “not a prison but…” triplet—redundant phrasing that borders paraphrase-loop—but redeemed by rhythmic payoff. Closure image (“something that was also her smiled and turned a page”) avoids purple prose while carrying conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose achieves high information density: “frozen bloom” conveys temporal, thermal, and thematic layers in three words. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—opening cadence (“The ember nexus existed...”) contrasts with climax’s staccato inevitability. One minor artifact: “vivify” appears twice in adjacent paragraphs (lines 12 and 15), slightly diluting impact. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (fire/frost duality), and every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence-level craft is exceptional: varied openings, rhythmic shifts matching emotional cadence, and high information density (e.g., “copper wiring she'd rewired herself” conveys history, skill, and scarcity in six words). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors (“knife through water,” “ship returning to harbor”) are coherent and purposeful. Final paragraph’s momentum carries through dawn descent without slack. Minor deduction only because “serenely electric” appears twice—slight redundancy in an otherwise pristine line.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “sand long since drained into some other timeline” conveys backstory and theme). Figurative language is purposeful (“ghostlight like a television losing signal”) without muddle. Minor paraphrase in “resilient positivity had carried her through worse nights” slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph cuts serving emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“sinew thread sang slightly… leaving faint trails of phosphorescence”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as question, thread as memory) and payoff-earned. Minor scaffold in “she had spent fifteen years…” but quickly subsumed by action. No loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. Closure beat is artifact-free, though “ghostly overlays” slightly risks abstraction—saved by immediate grounding in “translucent layers atop bedrock.”

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “light bent at the boundaries between media” conveys complex physics economically. Sentence openings vary (“Mira adjusted…”, “The aliens had arrived…”, “Hours passed…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One minor slip: “unfold-ed” hyphenation feels artifact-like, but doesn’t obscure meaning. Closure image (“learn to follow them”) resonates without overwriting, though “patient and ancient” slightly leans on stock descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“decades-old technology, retrofitted somehow to capture more than sound”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (“shadows pooled like spilled ink” → “mist... wrapping the atrium in gray silence”). Minor overwriting in “pulse-tracking in hearing aids, a method developed by engineers...” slightly stalls momentum, but the artifact doesn’t obscure causality or dull closure. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional cadence without monotony or scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“loomed,” “carved,” “threaded”) and varied syntax that mirrors emotional cadence. Figurative language is controlled—bioluminescent cables “glinted like ancient bones” enhances clarity rather than obscuring it. Minor scaffold appears in “her claustrophobia screamed at her to flee… But Elara had been her mentor…”—a near-paraphrase loop that slightly dulls the tension. Otherwise, every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes, and the final paragraph’s rhythm crystallizes the thematic payoff without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “astronomers had built it here once… Now Mira watched something else entirely” compresses history and reversal). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (“bone pushed up from deep earth,” “soft white equations”). Final paragraph’s cadence—heartbeat slowing, snow falling, observatory humming—resolves with musical inevitability. No artifacts dull closure; every image earns its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—“canyon like a throat,” “dust of forgotten pronunciations”—never muddled.

One minor flaw: slight overuse of lyrical abstraction in mid-story (“meaning itself became texture”) risks momentary opacity, but clarity returns at the climax. No loops, no scaffold, no purple bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density (“water to trickle upward,” “soil to float in gentle clouds”). Minor overwriting in “cosmic humor that hasn’t found its punchline yet”—slightly abstract for peak stress—but quickly grounded by physical response (hair rising). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final line (“stepped forward into the harmony untamed”) resonates without redundancy, closing the motif with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “grinding gears,” “honey and forgotten storms,” “hollow rhythm of the shell’s former life” do triple duty (atmosphere, character, theme). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One minor risk: “resonantly soft” slightly drifts into label-territory, but immediately grounds in physical effect (“spread like warmth through winter branches”). No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; closure image is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “borders existed more in the eyes of those who enforced them than in the dirt beneath a man's feet” exemplifies thematic compression. Minor figurative density in the climax (amber suspension, captured storm) risks slight overwriting but pays off in closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. One near-redundancy in “fragile connections” / “linking absences,” but not damaging.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)

No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“hallways curving in directions that Euclid would have wept to comprehend”) and pays off in the glowing geometric patterns. Minor overwriting in “accumulated narratives pressing against the room’s curved boundaries” slightly muddles physics, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully, and the final line (“expanded memory of one grandmother’s love”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “pigment... bled into the water and then into the photograph’s fibers” does triple duty (action, sensory detail, thematic setup). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (light as liquid, dreams as runners). Sentence openings vary (“She arrived,” “The library had been,” “Her motivation crystallized”), and paragraph cuts always shift knowledge or charge. Final line’s “glow” ties back to the palette’s light-absorbing wells, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (hair as key, fire as persistence, star as guide) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in “stubborn flame that had survived more extinctions than any ordinary candle”—slightly strained—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final paragraph’s simplicity earns its resonance without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “kelped wreck—a timber hull split open like a gutted fish” establishes setting, mood, and metaphor). Figurative language is coherent: leviathan, gutted fish, splintered fingers all reinforce violation and submersion. No loops or scaffold; even complex sentences vary structure. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “reflected starlight fell through the broken glass”—but clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “combative tenderness,” “spatial poetry of scattered fragments” do thematic and character work. Minor overwriting in “标本 of something that had once moved”—the untranslated Chinese momentarily disrupts flow. Otherwise, syntax varies purposefully, and paragraph cuts serve emotional pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is precise (“silence pressing like water,” “spirit luminous as heat shimmer”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with rhythm. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor deduction: one slightly over-ornate phrase (“interlaced hush of the sanctuary had accumulated silence over centuries”) risks slowing momentum, but it’s redeemed by immediate tactile payoff (“settling like fine dust”).

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“faces running like tears through the plaster”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in one beat: “methodically curious by nature, the kind of investigator who followed silence rather than sound” slightly stacks modifiers. No scaffold or filter-verb clusters, but the phrase “pregnant with the accumulated whispers” edges toward mixed metaphor. Closure image remains unblurred, and momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (“time collapsed into something more honest”), rhythmic variation, and zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is precise (“death had become an old colleague”) and coherent—no mixed metaphors. The only near-flaw: slight overuse of semicolons in mid-story, but this serves the contemplative cadence.

    High information density: “sunlight fractured into a thousand fragments” conveys setting, mood, and plot function (cipher aid). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Mira had served…”, “Through the frosted…”, “She held…”). Figurative language precise (“groans of the old airship” echoes later elevator groan). Minor deduction: “warmly inquisitive” slightly label-like, though immediately grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (clouds as emotions) and pays off in closure. Minor flaw: slight overuse of em-dashes in the middle section creates a faint rhythmic stutter, but it serves emotional fragmentation. No loops, no scaffolding—each image builds on the last. Final line’s cadence (“spool together into something she could carry forward”) perfectly echoes the opening’s tactile warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    High information density: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“hands knew the tree’s bark better than any face” establishes both trait and setting). Figurative language is controlled and coherent—patterns, fractals, breath—never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., the single-sentence paragraph before dawn). Final line’s “different scales of perception” echoes the opening without redundancy, closing the thematic loop with propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, purposeful paragraph breaks, and high information density (e.g., “strands of luminescence caught in the airship’s exterior rigging—stranded luminance that should have dissipated but instead seemed trapped”). Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“living shadow,” “sociable isolation”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but figurative language remains coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; the final line (“future she had only just begun to chart”) elegantly recharges the compass motif. One near-redundancy: “patterns that seemed almost deliberate” followed by “formations that pulsed like a heartbeat.”

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“dust motes hung suspended like frozen thoughts”), varied in rhythm, and free of paraphrase loops. However, figurative density occasionally borders on overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., “curtains of frozen light” following “solidified mist”), risking slight muddle. No scaffold or template cadence; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image is sharp, though one mixed metaphor (“sugar cubes in rainwater” for metal dissolving in glass) introduces minor incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose shows high information density: “floating rock arches drifted like stone clouds” establishes setting, tone, and motif in one image. Minor scaffold in “had watched them arrive… had watched them merge” (two adjacent past-perfect clauses), but no loops or redundancy. Figurative language is coherent—mists, shadows, wings all tie to core motifs. Final paragraph’s cadence (“strangers no longer, family by choice”) avoids sentimentality through concrete action (ringing bell, rain).

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mechanical song, hush pane, bruised light) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“springs held suspended moments… pendulums beat rhythms…”) slightly slows propulsion but serves accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (braided streams → braided grief → molecular chains) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “symphonic in its chaos” risks abstraction but is immediately grounded by concrete counterpoint (“river’s rush”). No loops or scaffold; information density is high, though one adjacent paraphrase (“form and unformed” / “holding shape… then dissolving”) slightly dulls propulsion without harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “crystalline branches holding more empty bottles than books” establishes setting, character priority, and theme in one phrase. Sentence openings vary (“She had traveled…” / “The building made…” / “At the library’s heart…”), avoiding monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“splitting every word into its spectrum”) and paid off (“prism through which all knowledge could be split”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“She had come…”, “The moment came…”, “Calyx pressed…”). One minor risk: “blaze of her obsession had tempered her into something harder” slightly edges toward abstraction, but it’s grounded by the physical act of choosing the left passage immediately after.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“stress cracks… spoke of pressure and time and the slow violence of seasons”).

Final line’s cadence perfect—sunrise arrives as revelation, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “bioluminescence—a genetic inheritance from ancestors who had lived beneath different stars” conveys world, character, and mystery in one clause. Figurative language is coherent (aurora as “memory made visible,” weather as “faithful dogs”) and escalates purposefully. Minor overwriting in “terrestrially cosmic hue” slightly strains clarity, and the phrase “conceptual reconfiguration” echoes rubric language, but these are hairline slips. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—no loops, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“crystals overhead filter nonexistent sunlight into prismatic tears” establishes setting, tone, and thematic paradox). Minor overwriting in “auroral sorrow” risks abstraction but pays off in closure’s “prismatic shadows… like memories given form.” No loops or scaffold; sentence variety mirrors emotional cadence. One near-redundancy: “mnemonically gifted memory cataloging” slightly stacks modifiers, but doesn’t obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“gilded-leaf,” “toxic sky churned amber”) and culminates in closure image without muddle. Minor overwriting in “gossamer sheets her canvas, gold her commitment…” slightly stalls momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s propulsion is flawless—gold leaf, candlelight, garden reborn in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “a bell without a clapper, a voice that only spoke when the world brushed against it just so”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—metals “remember tone,” ice “remembers pressure”—without purple excess. Minor redundancy in “silence that was full of sound” slightly dilutes the final paragraph, but rhythm remains varied and read-aloud strong. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (“hands rebuilt seventeen times… something that pulsed when the blooms released their nighttime fragrance”), varied sentence openings, and rhythmic control that breathes with emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances plot or character. Figurative language is coherent—“magnetic north shredded the sky into ribbons” aligns with later “static inside her processors.” Final line (“the only escapes that mattered were the ones that led you back to what you had always been tending”) recharges the opening with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“glinting,” “jammed,” “rumbled”) and sensory specificity. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. One paraphrase loop: “proof that someone had lived, hoped, failed, and tried again” echoes earlier phrasing without new pressure. Figurative language (“sandstorm calm,” “breadcrumbs”) is consistent and payoff-earned. No scaffold or register drift, though the final paragraph’s lyricism slightly overshadows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (water, code, dance as interwoven metaphors) and avoids muddle. Minor deduction: “hangman’s dice” phrase risks mixed metaphor (gambling vs. counting), but it’s redeemed by contextual redefinition. No loops, no scaffold—each image builds toward the draining chamber. Final line (“rewrite”) perfectly echoes the journal’s function without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “salt crystallizing everywhere from the whale's great body, from the tears of the town, from something older…” avoids redundancy while layering meaning. Figurative language is coherent (memories as luminescent fragments, gravity as emotional weight) and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “she had been lighting lanterns for seventeen years… now she carried no flame” slightly echoes, but not enough to dull momentum. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors Charged Poise—no overwriting, no loops.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ghost-motes,” “cartographers once mapped stars,” “tranquil blaze” all do thematic and atmospheric work. Minor overwriting appears in “terrestrially cosmic truth had come to her gradually”—slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete epiphanies. But rhythm varies masterfully, and the final paragraph’s cadence mirrors water’s inevitability. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “dead the way a closed door is dead”). Figurative language is consistent—architectural metaphors never contradict—and sentence openings vary naturally. Minor flaw: one slight overwriting in “stars streaking across the darkness like corrections written in the margins of the universe,” but it’s pattern-taught and pays off in theme. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; closure image remains uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Rhythm varies naturally—long, flowing sentences for twilight description; tighter phrasing for revelation. One minor slip: “elegant delusion” slightly edges toward label-speak, but it’s contextualized as institutional dismissal, not Mira’s self-diagnosis. No loops, scaffold, or purple prose; metaphors cohere (bleeding sky, trapped insects, velvet garden). Final paragraph’s propulsion is flawless, merging action, image, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“stalactites dripped their patient measure of time”) and paid off in closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; diction stays within Yuki’s artisan lexicon. Rhythm varies purposefully—meditative during work, crystalline at dawn. Final line (“its thorns defending a beauty that could not be forgotten”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Sentence openings vary (“She pressed,” “The starlight shifted,” “Elara had spent”), and paragraph lengths modulate breath. One minor flaw: “richly perceptive and infinitely alone” in the penultimate sentence edges toward label-speak, slightly dulling the embodied cost. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; the seashell’s warmth and starlight shadows propel momentum cleanly into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“wooden bones rose like cathedral ribs from the sand” conveys wreck, reverence, and scale). Figurative language is coherent—ice as sanctuary, dreams as snowfall—and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold in “weaving truth carefully… as one weaves silk” borders on redundant, but propulsion remains strong. Final paragraph’s cadence shift toward resolution (“she would find the living relatives…”) delivers earned momentum without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (“fireflies rose in scintillatingly somber flashes—each glow a small grief and a small joy held in the same trembling light”), varied sentence openings, and rhythmic control. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances character or theme. Minor deduction for slight over-density in figurative language during the firefly passage, but it serves the Accumulative lens and pays off in closure. Final line (“her whisk still warm from her hand”) echoes opening with earned resonance, not redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is precise, with high information density: “radiation mapping that marked every long-term resident” conveys history, danger, and character in one phrase. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and metaphors are coherent (“frozen tears,” “storm clouds around a stillpoint”). Minor deduction for one slight overwriting in “crystalline records of the exposure's exact parameters”—a touch technical but justified by context. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or knowledge. Final line’s propulsion perfectly recharges the stillpoint motif.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density: “static hiss of a thousand voices layered… like dying wasps” does atmospheric, auditory, and thematic work. Minor overwriting appears in the middle (“grit and grime of her isolation finally crystallize into something like hope”)—a slight abstraction amid otherwise concrete imagery. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one register drift toward pseudo-profundity slightly dulls an otherwise sharp final third. Rhythm varies effectively, supporting the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, vivid verbs (“bled,” “clinked,” “unraveled”), and controlled metaphor (“fill him like water filling an empty vessel”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence propels character, atmosphere, or theme. One minor flaw: “sweeten those raw recordings with the only currency he possessed—language” edges toward abstraction, slightly flattening an otherwise concrete system. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with the story’s emotional arc, and the final paragraph’s cadence echoes the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “azure coat snapping,” “copper cradle,” “subsonic tremor” all advance character, setting, and stakes. Minor overwriting in “sonic absolution” risks abstraction but is grounded by immediate physical effect (“rippled outward... smoothed jagged edges”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“She climbed,” “The sunset,” “Maren closed”). Closure beat avoids artifacts—relief is shown through slumping, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “basalt columns rising like the ribs of some ancient beast” does worldbuilding, atmosphere, and foreshadowing in one image. Sentence openings vary (“Kira had spent…”, “The magnetic viaduct emerged…”, “She arrived…”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “silver fire” slightly strains the ice-mirror motif, but no loops or scaffold. Final line crystallizes theme without summary: “see the destination in the journey itself” earns its lyricism through prior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is precise and evocative, with strong verbs (“seeping,” “concealed,” “resonated”) and varied sentence structures. Information density is high: “brass surface worn smooth by generations of Vasquez hands” conveys lineage, object history, and tactile intimacy in one phrase. Minor flaw: “entangled memories not her own” borders on abstract label-speak, though immediately grounded by sensory flashback. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “dropped coin into some vast and patient ledger,” “motes of dust that drifted through the air like small searching souls.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. One minor slip: “vibrant hush” appears twice, slightly diluting its impact. Otherwise, syntax varies naturally, paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, and figurative language coheres (light, music, mechanics). Final line lands with lyrical propulsion, not sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose exhibits zero loops or scaffold—every sentence propels story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is dense but coherent: the arrow tip is “sharp in the way questions are sharp,” a metaphor that pays off when it unlocks linguistic patterns. Sentence openings vary (“In the gears…”, “The arrow tip…”, “I rang…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm mirroring thematic cadence. Closure beat (“laughing at the glorious absurdity… worship”) avoids overwriting, landing with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language (“digital ghost images,” “echo of forgotten songs”) is consistent and payoff-earned. Minor scaffold in “The recurring numbers began appearing everywhere” slightly flattens momentum, but no paraphrase loops or template cadence mar peak beats. Final paragraph’s rhythm swells effectively, with clear propulsion and zero artifacts in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ice floes that shifted and groaned like sleeping giants” merges sound, motion, and metaphor without clutter. Sentences vary rhythmically, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and every line serves atmosphere, character, or stakes. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; even complex metaphors (“shadows… like veins through marble”) remain coherent. One minor slip: “weighted breath before reply” appears twice—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (ice as “distant bells,” endings as “breath”) and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold in “she had become... she had spent...” opening paragraph, but quickly subsumed by momentum. Final paragraph’s rhythm—short phrases building to “held and released”—perfectly mirrors thematic cadence. No loops, register drift, or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“bled amber,” “hummed its evening song”) and varied syntax. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “love should be enough… passion would find a way” restates the same hope twice. The Chinese insertion also disrupts read-aloud rhythm. Otherwise, high information density and zero filter-verb stacks; closure beat remains unmarred by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “Her mask covered only the left half of her face—the side that saw too much…” immediately establishes character, conflict, and world logic. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught (murmuring dunes, whisperfield calm) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on em-dashes in descriptive clauses, but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. Final line (“began the long walk back…”) perfectly echoes the opening rhythm while deepening meaning—exemplary closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences vary in structure, and paragraphs breathe with visual rhythm. However, the untranslated “梯形” is a line-level artifact that dulls clarity in a key descriptive beat. Additionally, slight overwriting in the final paragraph (“tapestry of meaning”) edges toward abstraction, though it’s rescued by the preceding concrete imagery. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the foreign glyph triggers a −0.6 deduction under Text Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density: “fractured rainbows,” “nocturnal sighs,” “sonically reflective.” Minor overwriting in “broken and beautiful” sequences, but figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors dawn’s arrival—breathing, not drumming.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme without scaffold or loop. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught—the fog as breath, memory as unspooling tape—and culminates in the biological metaphor of growing spines, never straining logic. Sentence openings vary (“The fog sculpture garden existed…”, “Mira moved…”, “She was precognitively forgetful…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the narrative’s ebb and flow. One minor slip: “tidal longing rising and falling in her chest like something born from the ocean of time itself” slightly overextends the metaphor, but it’s redeemed by the immediate return to concrete sensation (“unwatched videotapes hummed their silent static”).

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“luminous ache,” “radical gentleness”) and pays off in closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. One minor risk: “changelessly constant” borders on abstract, but it’s immediately anchored in the clock’s motion. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-zero scaffolding. Sentences vary rhythmically to mirror breath and heartbeat, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., the pause before Margery’s line). One minor flaw: “the scent of hope hung in the room—not the aggressive hope that demanded miracle…” slightly over-explains; the concept could be trusted to resonate without definition. Otherwise, figurative language is coherent (vinyl as moon, light as water), and every image pulls double duty for character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but propulsive, with high information-per-line yield. Opening metaphor (“phosphorescent fish”) immediately establishes tone and scale. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding template cadence, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., the stark break before “The discovery came…”). Minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the climax (“shadow rose like breath…”) risks purple prose, but it’s earned by the accumulative texture. No paraphrase loops, filter-verb stacks, or simultaneity errors; every image advances atmosphere or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“Resolution meant endings, and nothing involving changelings ever truly ended”). Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (fracture → window → constellation). Rhythm varies naturally—short staccato beats (“She was both”) contrast with flowing descriptions of the garden. Final line (“fractured things could learn to hold weight differently”) recharges the bone-setting motif without redundancy. No overwriting; modifiers serve specificity (“porcelain skin unmarked,” “faint luminescence”).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “reflectively vibrant” does double duty describing sea glass and thematic function. Minor scaffold in “the work demanded stillness, and in that stillness…”—a near-paraphrase loop—but quickly redeemed by the “pearl of stillness” payoff. Figurative language is coherent (light = memory = purpose); no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm swells then settles, mirroring Elira’s arc. One slight redundancy: “filtered light that filtered”—but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (moss as forgiveness, water as remaking) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in “honeyed hush” repetition, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“simply stay… simply witness… simply proffer”) is deliberate and resonant, not templated. High information density without sacrificing clarity or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“The conflicted novelist…”, “She had come…”, “The mist thickened…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the middle section (“ephemeral cameo appearances,” “perpetual damp embrace”) risks density without payoff, though the pattern is taught early. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “brittle as autumn leaf,” “amber and pearl” mist, “spun sunlight” filaments—all advance atmosphere and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve breath and focus. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“luminous leaves that seemed to pulse with inner fire”) leans purple but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffolding; every line pulls weight. Closure image lands cleanly, though one stacked modifier slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: “patience of frost settling on stone” establishes tone without overwriting. Most figurative language serves the Accumulative lens, though “alchemical flash-paper” slightly strains plausibility without grounding. Minor redundancy in “discarded items she collected” / “debris scattered across the crater floor.” Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with “ready to guide whoever found it next”—a rare explanatory nudge where image alone could suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences multitask (e.g., “forests had shed their leaves but the snow had not yet claimed the ground” establishes time, mood, and thematic liminality). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“echoes as sediment,” “light tracing gear paths”) and payoff-consistent. Minor redundancy in “wounded season” repetition (lines 1 and 14) slightly dulls momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors the “lull” it describes—breathing, not stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. Metaphors are coherent (“shingled hush,” “ancient lung exhaling”) and never contradictory. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines (“layer upon layer of silence overlapping like the scales of some great sleeping thing, each layer muting the next”), bordering on paraphrase-loop, but it serves the accumulative design. No scaffold, no filler; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. The final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the deepening silence it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, each line doing multiple jobs: “shavings fell like whispers” conveys sound, motion, and emotional weight. Figurative language is coherent—rain “crystallizes” light, grief “holds” the dead—and never muddles causality. Minor artifact: slight overuse of “the color of…” in final paragraph, but it serves cadence and payoff. No loops, no scaffold; every sentence propels toward the Charged Poise of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the sky still remembered the music—faint ribbons of melody that unraveled upward like smoke pretending to be something finer”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Minor figurative density in the climax (“accumulated weight of every unlived possibility”) slightly risks overload but pays off in closure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and verbs are strong (“eroded,” “unraveled,” “forecloses”). No scaffold or synonym churn; every image serves pressure or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “hollow ribcage,” “dark ribbons” of sediment, and “ghost of music” do double duty in atmosphere and theme. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with pacing, and technical terms (“secondary aquifer,” “filtration system”) feel authentic. One minor flaw: the phrase “functionally creative” borders on label-speak, though it’s immediately grounded in action. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; the final image lands with clean propulsion and zero artifacts in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and theme without redundancy. Figurative language is purposeful (“silence was the loudest thing”) and coherent within the clockwork/petrichor motif system. Minor risk: “excuciatingly gentle deliberateness” borders on over-modification, but rhythm recovers instantly. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the clock’s hesitant restart—rhythm as meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is precise, with high information density: “twilight settle over the canal like a held breath” establishes mood, time, and tension in one image. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with thought, and metaphors cohere (e.g., lies as sediment, silence as static-hush). One minor slip: “thoughtfully clear satisfaction” borders on label-speak, though it’s quickly grounded in physical action. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or overwriting—even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“ghosts in the cold harbor air,” “lightning-etched channels”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though one run of participle openings (“breath creating… fog rolling… snow beginning…”) slightly dulls propulsion. Information density is high—each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere—and the final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors Charged Poise. Minor figurative stacking prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“leaves fell like whispered confessions,” “fountain dry as old bone”) without muddle or overwriting. Minor deduction for slight syntactic similarity in two adjacent descriptive clauses near the midpoint, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“The thought did not grieve her…”) delivers clean, resonant closure without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“rusty chandeliers dangled like mechanical flowers frozen mid-bloom”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors—and sentence openings vary rhythmically. Minor scaffold appears in “each theory felt true and false simultaneously,” a near-paraphrase of earlier doubt, but it’s brief and doesn’t dull closure. The final paragraph’s cadence (“sorrow and hope reconciled into purpose”) earns its lyricism through accumulated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: "black volcanic sand crunching softly beneath her boots" conveys sound, texture, geology, and movement in one phrase. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (fire/water as dance, scars singing) and peaks without muddle—the "molten gold" lagoon epiphany avoids mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on visual descriptors in mid-paragraph, though justified by Mira’s reflective state.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“migrating geese paused overhead, their V-formation fragmenting against a pewter sky”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light motifs recur without muddle) and peaks cleanly at closure. Minor scaffold in “realistically imaginative patience” slightly abstracts, but immediately grounds in “considering its construction.” No loops, no purple excess; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “bioluminescent petals unfolding in slow rotation, each bloom a small sun that needed no fire to burn” establishes setting, theme, and physics in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (light/fire/shadow motifs never contradict), and rhythm mirrors Vael’s drift—expansive then hushed. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “infinite regression of calculation chasing its own tail,” which edges toward abstraction. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; final line crystallizes all motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose achieves high information density: “rusting into the color of autumn leaves” conveys decay, season, and emotional tone in one image. Rhythm varies purposefully—paragraph lengths breathe with Elara’s focus shifts—and zero paraphrase loops. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “spectral mentorship” passage (“whorls of wood grain and the patience required…” leans ornamental), but no artifacts dull closure. Final line’s “hands that shaped them” resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line. Figurative language (“sky bruised purple and gold,” “hollow resonance”) is consistent and purposeful, never muddled. Sentence openings vary (“He pushed,” “The pendulum rose,” “Marcus exhaled”); paragraph lengths shift to mirror emotional cadence. One minor slip: “incremental absolution” appears twice in close proximity, risking slight redundancy, but the repetition serves thematic reinforcement. No loops, scaffold, or purple prose; every image tightens the narrative coil toward the charged final descent.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors (“shadows that had the texture of deep velvet”) are coherent and purposeful. Sentence openings vary, and information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or mystery. Minor overwriting in “cobalt silo, a cylindrical chamber of blue-tinged stone” (redundant), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final beat (“uncharted echoes… found their listener”) risks slight abstraction but lands with emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears (“vast territories of what remained unknown, mapping the ragged edges where certainty surrendered to mystery”). The “连锁反应” typo is a jarring artifact. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “humility to acknowledge… and audacity to nonetheless reach.” Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with stacked abstractions (“seed innovation… prevail against temptation…”), though the closing line restores clarity. High information density overall.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (“printed word had grown thin as ash,” “ghosts of their daytime selves”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths modulate breath, and rhythm supports emotional cadence. No loops, scaffolding, or register drift; even elevated diction (“orchestral scores,” “resonant reconfiguration”) stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon as a meticulous archivist-musician.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (e.g., “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” conveys vocation, method, and ethos in four words). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as memory, ash as essence) and never muddled; metaphors cohere physically (powder fills hollows, shards catch light). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter dull the closure. One minor slip: “mirage of safety radiating from fractured fragments” slightly overloads the vehicle, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density per line (e.g., “sedimentary layers that the plague years had deposited—not geological sediment… but the slower accumulation of abandoned objects”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with thematic cadence, and figurative language is coherent (sediment as historical strata). Minor scaffold appears in the second paragraph (“The plague did not descend… long enough for… long enough for…”)—a slight paraphrase loop—but it serves rhetorical emphasis without dulling closure. No register drift or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “soundhole rosette catching what little light” conveys setting, object, and metaphor in one image. Minor overwriting in “melody sung in the wrong dialect might earn a family transport”—slightly abstract for peak beat. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“She had come…”, “But the human voice…”, “A young man…”). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes opening stillness without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “synaptic pathways… opened like flower buds” merges neurology and botany without muddle. Sentence variety supports momentum—short clauses (“She knelt.”) punctuate lush descriptions. One minor artifact: “gentle rebellion” appears twice in near-identical phrasing (mid-story and finale), risking slight redundancy, but payoff justifies recurrence. No filter-verb stacks or purple prose; every image advances character or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “copper spire tarnished by decades of storms,” “hummed with stored energy” → “only silence and shadow.” Figurative language is purposeful, not dense—“nectar dusk” appears twice, evolving in resonance. Minor scaffold in “The revelation came not as a sudden flash but as a slow dawn” edges toward cliché, but it’s redeemed by immediate concrete follow-through. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, not filler.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the shard of hush that she carries is not silence but something like its opposite” exemplifies high information density. No loops or scaffold—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is consistent (light as consciousness, scent as memory) and never muddles closure. Minor deduction only for one slightly over-modified phrase (“violet ghost”), but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “barnacles and silence” fuses texture and theme; “structural weakness in his own rigid definition” ties metaphor to character. Minor overwriting in one beat (“cascade of waves, each one breaking against the next”) slightly muddles rhythm, but closure remains sharp. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line (“spreading like light through water”) earns its lyricism through prior concrete buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)

The final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates appropriately, culminating in the resonant shift from “cage of impossibility” to “landscape of possibility.”

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“streetlamps bleeding into the smog like dying stars,” “saffron quiet”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentences vary rhythmically, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One minor flaw: “methodically hopeful” edges toward label-speak, though it’s quickly grounded in action. No scaffold or template cadence; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. The final paragraph’s propulsion is flawless, culminating in earned stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (e.g., “a museum guide without walls” conveys loss, identity, and irony). Figurative language is pattern-taught (prisms, seeds, honey) and coheres without muddle; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the middle paragraph where backstory about the beekeeper borders on summary, though it’s anchored by the rosewater scent. Final lines achieve rhythmic closure with concrete action (“carried it toward the entrance”) that recharges earlier motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“The string felt wrong… spun from something outside normal physical law”).

Final line (“language that had no past tense”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent (e.g., “crooked tooth in an old man’s grin” → “peeling smile” → “desperate hands”) and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“sorrowful strips that fluttered… like desperate hands”) slightly slows momentum, but rhythm accelerates effectively during the climax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; the final line’s “repulsive allure… light worth carrying” reweights earlier motifs with earned resonance.

Read-aloud rhythm supports the musical theme without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sunwashed dread had become the texture of everyday life” merges atmosphere, emotion, and world logic. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor deduction for slight overuse of figurative language in the second paragraph (“poured through the cloudless sky like something dying”), which borders on purple but doesn’t obscure clarity. Final beat remains clean, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in the mid-section (“ornate border of intertwined acanthus leaves and its precise Gothic script”) slightly dilutes propulsion, though not enough to obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Final lines achieve Charged Poise without purple prose, though one adjacent sentence pair edges toward conceptual redundancy (“rescue truth… convenient concealment”).

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)

Sentence openings vary naturally; rhythm breathes with the tide’s pulse. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. One minor slip: “bruised sky” borders on cliché, but it’s redeemed by immediate contextual grounding in dried ink, avoiding figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“truth revealed itself through accumulation rather than revelation,” “stillness... reclaimed”) is consistent and never contradictory. Minor scaffold appears in “she had learned to notice...” followed by restatement, but no paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final paragraph’s cadence shift—slowing to “sediment settling”—propels closure without overwriting. One slight redundancy (“dismissed as idle notes” / “idle scratchings”) prevents a 9.0+, but line-level craft remains exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow/dream motifs) and pays off at closure without muddle.

Minor overwriting in “luminous torment” passage slightly slows momentum, but clarity at closure remains intact—no artifact penalties applied.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Every sentence multitasks: “The pocket burned in the explosion but the geode emerged untouched” conveys plot, character, and theme. Figurative language is coherent—the geode as “sleeping god,” cables humming with “patience of condemned things”—and never muddles clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence (“hold it up to the light and watch it scatter...”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“sleeping sentinels,” “violet burn”) is controlled and consistent. Minor redundancy in “fading sunlight caught the ancient tool marks” / “sunlight caught...tool marks” slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or register drift. Final paragraph’s “brilliant dimness” encapsulates tone without overwriting. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, especially in the machine-awakening sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density—e.g., “driftwood lay scattered like bones of forgotten stories” merges setting, theme, and emotion. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “slow bruise spreading through tissue and time” and “cancer of guilt” verge on mixed metaphors, and “sieved hush” feels slightly forced. No loops or scaffolding, but these figurative strains cost a half-point from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence multitasks (e.g., “worn smooth by their touch until it fit his palm like a familiar word” conveys history, texture, and intimacy).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with imagery but avoids overwriting through purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structure. Each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot—e.g., “cinnamon from forests where trees dreamed in amber” conveys both setting and emotional texture. Minor deduction for two adjacent lines near the climax (“She would become the bridge… carry messages…”) that slightly paraphrase the same idea without added pressure. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; metaphors are coherent (scent as “holy fire,” moonlight as “arms”). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly supports closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “the crack catching moonlight like a silver vein” conveys object, light, and metaphor in one stroke). Minor overwriting in mid-text—“years folding into themselves like origami birds made of regret” slightly strains the metaphor—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally.

No artifacts dull the closure; rhythm and image fuse perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is precise: varied sentence openings, strategic paragraph cuts, high information density (“twelve constellations she had gathered across kingdoms and deserts”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor figurative density in the eclipse paragraph borders on overwriting but is pattern-taught and paid off in the bugs’ final message. Closure beat remains clear, avoiding artifact penalties that would block 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “faint amber glow on the horizon to paint the courtyard in shadow” establishes mood and spatial logic in one stroke. Sentence openings vary (“The luminous fort…”, “Elara stood…”, “She moved…”), avoiding template cadence. One minor redundancy: “calmly inventive” appears twice, but the second use reinforces thematic payoff. No mixed metaphors or register drift; figurative language is sparse and precise (“winking hush of the blackout”). Final line’s “kindle something far more enduring” avoids purple prose by grounding abstraction in tactile verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“borrowed dawn,” “collapsed star dust”) and pays off in closure.

Closure line (“mapping scars that were finally beginning to heal”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Syntax varies purposefully, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Figurative language is controlled—sparks “shower,” shadows “encode secrets”—without muddle. One paraphrase loop: “conflict into illumination” / “transform conflict into illumination” within three lines. Final paragraph’s “ongoing conversation between water and stone” risks abstraction but is grounded by concrete antecedents.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“skeletal cage,” “second heart,” “anarchy of circumstance”) and varied rhythm. Sentences advance multiple layers—character, theme, atmosphere—without redundancy.

No loops or scaffold; every paragraph alters emotional charge. Final line resonates without summarizing, closing the motif of continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation that mirrors emotional cadence. Sentences do double duty—e.g., “the hands frozen at 11:47” conveys time, trauma, and object simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One slight overwriting moment: “condensation and memory” risks abstraction, but is redeemed by immediate sensory follow-through. Final paragraph achieves propulsion without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “cataloging which dreams had manifested overnight and which had dissolved into mist” conveys world, character, and stakes in one clause. Rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph lengths mirroring ascent and revelation. Minor flaw: “empirical whimsy” appears only in the final sentence as a summary label, slightly violating show-don’t-tell at a critical beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though one near-redundancy (“trembling fragments of their aging dreams” / “every memory left to fade”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“The rain had passed,” “Marek sat,” “The breeze picked up”), avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in “rhythmically placid whisper, as though the island itself were breathing slowly after a long fever”—slightly ornate, but forgivable as establishing tone. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; metaphors cohere (storm/sky/light motif). Final paragraph’s propulsion perfectly balances lyricism and closure without purple excess.
