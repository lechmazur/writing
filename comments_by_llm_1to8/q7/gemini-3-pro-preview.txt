  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in observational passages. Minor loop detected: "the decay was acting upon the wing just as time acted upon the pulsars" repeats the entropy equation already established in paragraph one without advancing pressure. The phrase "preprocessed" appears three times, creating slight template cadence. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle: "thief" versus "rearrangement of energy" in paragraph three blurs the metaphor's coherence. Propulsion is strong through most beats, though the penultimate paragraph slightly over-explains the thematic point before the fingertip image rescues clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid with strong information density and varied syntax. Overwriting appears in clusters: "profound darkness felt like a different element entirely," "drifting resonance of the wind...a low and mournful vibration," "deepest curve of the night," and the stacked metaphors in the final paragraph ("ghostly tracks," "guiding hum," "glass hardening"). These figurative layers in high-pressure beats blur clarity slightly (−0.5). "Steadily adaptive" and "fragile timeframe" read as slightly elevated for the moment. No loops or scaffold, but the density of metaphor in the closure run limits propulsion. Clarity remains high overall.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence-level clarity is high, with strong verbs ("struck," "blossoming," "flaring") and concrete imagery. However, figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence in the climax carries a metaphor or simile (visual symphony, dying candle, drowning dark, protective blanket, complex sonata)—which risks overwriting in a high-pressure beat without pattern-teaching or payoff that recharges the closure. Minor paraphrase loop: "desperate colors struggling against the cold" / "colors... shifted... smoothing into rhythmic waves" restates the orchids' state across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the action sequence: "He reached... He unlatched... He selected... He struck... He waved..." A cluster of filter verbs ("he knew," "he fought," "watching") slightly dulls immediacy. These issues cumulatively apply a −0.8 deduction within Q7 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: "He was a weary undertaker, and he had traveled this far down into the dark not to seek treasure, but to bury a noise that refused to die" does multiple jobs. Figurative language is vivid and controlled—"like a whale dying in a cathedral," "velvet shroud"—without muddle. Minor loop: "The distress signals evaporated, the panic dissolving" paraphrases the prior "screaming...ceased." Template cadence in exposition ("He was...," "He approached...," "He pulled...") across consecutive paragraphs slightly dulls propulsion. No pronoun confusion or tense drift. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across sentence lengths, and sensory specificity is strong ("velvet," "terra-cotta lattice," "protein blocks"). However, scaffold persists: "She was a leader defined by being gently persistent" tells rather than shows, and several beats loop—"silence" recurs five times, "arbor" four times within tight proximity without added pressure. Template cadence in the ritual sequence ("She cleared her throat… she murmured… She placed the bell back") flattens momentum. No figurative muddle or major opacity, but information density could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and camera-work passages. Two friction clusters lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop in the final third—"He realized then that the reservoir he was looking for was not a place, but an action. Unused love was not stored in a vault; it was fuel waiting for a pilgrim to burn it"—restates the same insight across adjacent lines without added pressure. (2) Stock metaphor: "hitting him with the force of a physical blow" and "dissipated into the ether like smoke" are well-worn phrases that dull specificity. The breath-matching sequence is crisp, and spatial choreography (velvet shroud, paper screen, stone bench) tracks cleanly. Minimal scaffolding, but the loop and stock images in peak beats prevent entry to high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propels through the weaving sequence. Information density is high in the climax (geometry, fragment, disintegration). However, the opening paragraph carries scaffold: "colossal structure woven from the still-growing roots of ancient banyan trees that spanned a fog-choked chasm" stacks modifiers without urgency. The phrase "floating, translucent rectangles that resembled fading photographs" is repeated conceptually ("two-dimensional prisons," "flat images," "sepia haze") across the first third, creating synonym churn. The final beat—"tangible, quaking beauty of the absolute present"—is elevated but legible. No major loops in the climax, but early density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and the action sequence is clear. Minor loop: "the sound" appears twice in quick succession (roar/cacophony, then shattering glass). Template cadence in the opening: "The concussive thud... Dust motes danced... Elias stood" cycles through similar structures. "Staggering grace" and "chaotic heap of oxidized brass skeleton keys" push toward purple without crossing fully. The Fibonacci spiral solve and arrow-as-key mechanics are specific and vivid. One paraphrase: "the barrier... was finally breaching, collapsing" restates in adjacent clauses without adding pressure. Applying −0.6 for template cadence and minor loops.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, three frictions accumulate: paraphrase loop in paragraphs 16–17 (curated voids/distilled essence), elevated diction in peak beats ("microscopic pauses," "heatless energy," "jagged shape of betrayal") that edges toward overwriting, and the phrase "battered marvel of engineering" appearing mid-ritual without prior setup, reading as thematic assertion. Information density is high, but scaffold and metaphor stack in the final third reduce propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., flower codes anchor Guild danger and delay tactics). A few phrases lean decorative without advancing pressure: "world suddenly made new" inflates the close, and "metaphysical hunger to press your ear against destiny's door" courts overwriting. Two paraphrase touches appear ("the specific pairing" / "directive: do not move" and "capture the essence" / "stolen golden portrait"), but they don't obscure causality. No template cadence or loops mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; no paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Two minor slips lower the score: "sweeping a pile of ash into a dustpan with the grand flourish of a matador" stacks modifiers without adding clarity, and "paralyzed society waiting below the tree line" introduces an off-stage abstraction that doesn't pay off. The closure image ("descended the gantries into the weeping slush") is clean and propulsive. Filter verbs ("looked at," "walked to") cluster mid-story but don't obscure peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases trend toward overwriting: "decaying monument where the roof had long since dissolved," "biological replicate designed to absorb impact and fracture," "transformative betrayal had not numbed him, but rather stripped away his artificial conditioning." The decrypt sequence (deep groove = four; sharp scratch = seven) is concrete and propulsive. Minor paraphrase loop: "He was a stunt double, a biological replicate" restates the same idea. The closing line "his fear had saved him while the hero's bravery had left him exposed to the flame" borders on thematic summary but stops short of full moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful with strong figurative language ("drowning ember," "ambered hush," "marbled hush streaked with gray veins of regret"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or ritual. Minor overwriting clusters in the middle third: "This marbled hush weighed down the atmosphere, pressing the stones into the dirt and silencing the very dust" stacks metaphors without added pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines frame the ritual cleanly. The figurative density in peak beats risks slight opacity but remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high across most beats. Two localized issues lower the score: the phrase "the reality fractures for the custodial staff to clean up" in the opener reads slightly abstract, and the middle paragraphs ("Throughout the chaotic cleanup, he remained remarkably composed") include a brief scaffold loop where composure is both shown and told within adjacent lines. The final beat—dropping the violin, archiving data—compresses cleanly without ornament. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the cumulative minor drag (−0.6) and one paraphrase moment keep the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, character stakes, or world rules. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric passages giving way to shorter beats during the lens demonstration. However, several paraphrase loops and scaffold phrases appear: "Mara frowned, her telepathic projection radiating sharp confusion and defensive anger" immediately follows "She did not understand"; "the damp air around them settling into a resonant hush that vibrated against their skin like a held breath" stacks modifiers without adding clarity. Template cadence in the final third ("He had been," "She realized," "She understood") flattens momentum. Minor filter-verb reliance ("He watched her barriers tremble") is voice-legible but frequent. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat itself, limiting total deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and purposeful with strong sensory specificity ("sharp tang of fermentation," "hungry light"). Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates during the ritual sequence. A few adjacent lines restate concepts with slight synonym variation ("broken tools" / "emptiness inside" / "fracture"; "luck quotient" / "metaphysical luck") that add −0.3. One paraphrase loop in the backstory paragraph ("concentrated vessels of good fortune" / "profitable lie" / "exposing his fraud") adds another −0.2. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high; no scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative beats during lever pull, longer accumulative sentences in the opening. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. Minor paraphrase loop: "The scientists claimed... vanished" and "when the scientists panicked... he would offer" revisit the same contrast without escalating pressure. Stock metaphor "sky a bruise" is serviceable but not fresh. Figurative language in the climax ("gossamer light," "phantom fluttering") supports the moment without overwriting. Zero grammar or tense errors.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled with strong figurative language throughout. Minor loop appears: "The lanterns cast long, dancing shadows" and later "As the liquid turbulence distorted the lantern light" recycle the lantern-image without reweighting it. Overwriting check: figurative density is high ("weeping velvet," "pregnant, suffocating pause," "sunken cathedral of sound") but mostly pattern-coherent as lyric accumulation. One filter-verb cluster early ("he felt vibrating," "he felt") slightly dulls immediacy. Sentence openings vary; information density is high with minimal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking ("auroral sorrow," "the weight of a swallowed truth," "diffuse fog that covered the world"), with varied syntax and clear sequencing. Information density is high, especially in the setup. However, multiple lines carry overwriting and register drift: "bio-digital chimera engineered to process contradictory data streams without suffering total systemic collapse" stacks technical modifiers that blur immediacy; "swaying certainties, probability waves that undulated with a hypnotic, rhythmic confidence" doubles metaphors for the same concept. The smudge sequence is concrete and propulsive, but earlier beats lean on elevated abstraction ("categorical variable," "contextual cues," "confidence intervals") that distances the reader from embodied action. No major loops, but figurative density in the opening third slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong—rhythm varies, information density is high, and most lines do double duty. "He navigated the darkness by interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, using the spikes in static and the terrified cadence of the voices to map the invisible stress lines of the tunnel" packs method, setting, and motivation into one sentence. Minor scaffold: "It was during the hush that follows a sudden confession that the mill woke up" could be tighter. No loops or template cadence runs. One small clarity slip: "the audio quality sharpening impossibly in the underground dark" leans slightly purple but doesn't obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is deployed with control: "the books were merely trelliswork," "soft as wet paper," "drank the dim, bioluminescent light." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor issues: "cryptic folds in a well-worn origami swan" appears twice verbatim (once as prompt element, once as internal narration), a small loop. The final third maintains clarity and propulsion without artifact intrusion at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully (longer setup sentences, clipped eclipse beats). Two craft slips: "This magic was distinct because it was softly adaptive, molding itself effortlessly to the emotional contours of whoever encountered it" is expository scaffold that tells rather than showing the magic's mechanics (−0.3). "The link snapped into place with almost audible clarity" is clichéd sensory language at the climax (−0.2). No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift; figurative density (gossamer corona, river stones, black disc wreathed in fire) is high but mostly controlled. Final line ("the light in Elara's eyes remained") is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm is generally strong with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("hollow iron lung," "dragons fall from the sky, their scales turning to ash"). Information density is high in the tapestry and diary beats. However, elevated diction is dense throughout without reprieve: "geological betrayal," "celestial dance," "magnetic ley lines," "collective consciousness." In a high-pressure close-reading beat, every sentence carries figurative weight, creating a relentless texture that risks overwriting. Minor paraphrase: "the structure...seemed to relax" and "having finally unburdened itself" restate the same release. No significant loops or scaffolding, but the unmodulated register lowers momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (fortune-cookie writer as cover, microdot specs mechanics, prophetic examples all compressed efficiently). Figurative language ("glass hive," "microscopic stars") enhances rather than obscures. Minor scaffold appears: "He realized with sudden clarity" is a slight tell where embodied perception could land harder, and "terrifying attribute had manifested" edges toward abstract summary. The opening and closing images are strong. No loops or template cadence runs; grammar and sequencing are clean. Propulsion is steady, though the middle exposition (prophetic examples) slightly slows momentum before the climactic lever-pull. Overall, line-level craft is controlled and legible, with no artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mostly distinct, but several paraphrase loops appear: "silence silence you" is immediately repeated in loop form (intentional), yet "The atmosphere... possessed a terrifying, muffled clarity. / Every sound was distinct, yet heavy" restates the same sensory idea without added pressure. "Expository thought that paraphrases on-page action" occurs when "The paralysis... was being pulled apart" follows the already-shown softening posture. Figurative density is high ("puncture wound in reality," "lattice of words," "swirling architecture of grammar") and mostly coherent, though "clear syrup that slowed the passage of time" strains physics. Information density is strong in action beats; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences serve dual or triple duty (setting, method, emotional state). Syntax varies purposefully: the opening long sentence establishes voice, shorter beats punctuate the shell experiment, and the climactic paragraph expands to match transcendence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor texture issue: "aching pull" and "profound nostalgia" in adjacent lines restate the chronological homesickness without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language (paused breath, bruised sky, calcified echo) is vivid and coherent, though "bruise with purple and gold" verges on stock dawn imagery. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resolve by image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("blooming stone flower," "bleed luminescent vapor") charges atmosphere without obscuring action. Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or image. Two friction points lower the score: "darkening brightness" is repeated as both description and concept without evolution, risking synonym loop, and "the physics of this place" + "procedural engine of the universe" introduce meta-commentary that abstracts rather than dramatizes the world rules. The final beat (boot-strike, ripple, timeline fusion) is clean and propulsive, keeping closure untouched. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected, but the elevated diction density in high-pressure moments ("algorithmic randomization," "singularity of her being") approaches overwriting without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm generally supports the ritual's escalation; sentence structure varies purposefully. Clarity is mostly strong, though some figurative constructions blur immediacy: "filament of hush," "slender, silver thread of absolute silence," "womb of resonance" stack metaphors without grounding them in Silas's tactile specifics. The phrase "utilizing the method of backward recorded songs to unwind the tangled knots of his apathy" reads expository and explanatory mid-scene. Minor paraphrase loop: "dull, grinding friction" and "grinding turntable" within close proximity. The closure beat ("ready to teach again") is clean and propulsive. No major loops or scaffold, but density could tighten in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the gate-break and climb ("she shuffled sideways," "hand over hand"). Information density is high in the physical beats. Two minor loops appear: "the air felt heavy with unspoken threats" / "atmosphere possessed a layered tranquility" restate similar content, and "moved toward her equipment" is followed immediately by describing the equipment without advancing pressure (−0.2 paraphrase loop, −0.3 scaffold). No figurative muddle or template cadence in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion are strong; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the wall-scraping sequence and slowing at the moment of choice. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("He knelt… He worked… He knew…" across three paragraphs), but it doesn't obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or stock metaphors touch the closure beat. One figurative mixed moment: "silk dragged over gravel" is vivid but slightly contradictory in texture (silk is smooth, gravel is coarse—intention may be synesthetic contrast, but it risks muddle). Proofreading is clean; no pronoun drift or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("fragile lung," "metal wreath," "transparent cello") is purposeful without clutter. Minor template-cadence slip: "This was the Echo Harbor…" followed by "This sensitivity…" in adjacent paragraphs. A handful of elevated diction choices ("mendicant's bowl," "acoustically perceptive," "magnificent simplicity") read slightly formal for the POV's lived-in interiority but remain legible and do not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks; the closure beat is clean. Overall propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but elevated diction clusters in exposition without always advancing pressure: "a complex chemical architecture designed to bypass the logic centers and rewire the heart" and "the volatile compounds to drift toward her" lean toward ornamentation. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "He did not pity her, for he knew the distinct value of the service he provided. Reality was a commodity..." could tighten by cutting the first clause. "The amber grotto seemed to glow brighter, reflecting the synthetic warmth now blooming within her chest" mixes metaphor (glow/synthetic warmth) without full coherence. No loops or template cadence, but density could increase.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and free of major loops or scaffolding. Information density is high in the opening (shrewd broker, Maritime Athenaeum, mistaken envelope) without overwriting. Minor template cadence appears in the reflection blocks ("Years ago, a stranger...and he saw this delivery..."), and a few lines trend slightly elevated ("the promise of a friendship kindled," "constellations wheeling above") but remain voice-plausible. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. The final line ("kindness was the only currency...") is clean but declarative rather than image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with strong visual imagery (quartz trees, obsidian arbor, dried stalks). However, figurative density peaks in exposition—"luminescent ache," "invisible, impenetrable webs," "vibrated, extending a thread"—where metaphor stacks without concrete action anchors. Paraphrase appears: "not by mimicking their hardness, but by wrapping it in her own bold sympathy" restates the prior image. Light template cadence and modifier stacks ("soft, organic decay"; "tight-knit group of locals") reduce propulsion in high-concept beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance stakes or setting. Minor template-cadence slip in the opening sequence: "She navigated... She was driven... She gripped" uses repeated subject-verb stems. "Terrifying attribute that sculpts time itself" leans toward elevated exposition. Figurative language ("echoes are born," "stolen hour") is functional but accumulates in the middle third. No loops or major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies; opening lines are strong. However, several beats loop conceptually: "ambiguous loss" is defined twice in adjacent paragraphs, and "data had changed" / "solution existed" paraphrase the same shift. Figurative density is high ("gelatinous uncertainty," "joinery," "dovetail," "borrowed consciousness") without pattern-teaching, occasionally muddling clarity. The mosaic's mechanics—how chips "rearranged themselves"—remain vague at the closure beat. Minor: "He knelt...he withdrew...He believed...He poured" runs template cadence for four consecutive beats mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across beats; information density is high in the discovery sequence. Figurative language occasionally stacks without clear payoff ("jagged, failing rhythm," "electrical heartbeat," "hollow-boned fossils" all within two paragraphs). Minor loops: "sense memory" appears twice in one sentence; "sapphire hush" recurs but purposefully. "Kindly methodical" is used identically in two locations. The closure image is clear. A paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "He did not merely see… the texture… triggered" restates the same sensory conflation. Template stems ("He was," "She did not see") appear but do not obscure causality. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting: "suffocatingly rich with oxygen, a hyper-saturated atmosphere that made his burning lungs ache for release" stacks near-synonyms where one phrase would carry the urgency. The phrase "greedy absorption" in the rain moment is vivid and apt. Clarity at closure is strong: the action sequence (hand opens, leaf falls, leans into trellis) is legible and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; information density is high (most lines advance image, character, or world). "A speck of memory in the dark" and "jealous god, hoarding its toxicity" show fresh phrasing. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "obsessively trying to distill the world's ruin into pigment and shadow" could tighten, and "the terrifying clarity of his next subject" slightly overstates. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; the "geometric embrace" of rebar and coral works. Proofreading clean; no artifacting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high in the opening (bedrock, symphonic resonance, bioluminescent pulse, obsidian gloom) but the middle section loops conceptually: "steadily unpredictable, fluctuating in a chaotic rhythm" repeats the same idea in adjacent clauses. Template cadence appears in the explanation paragraphs: "For the first time…sat frozen," "The entity inside…was not a demon or a god, but…," "Elara realized…that her visions had always…" — each opening with subject-verb-past and stacking abstract clauses. The phrase "bright darkness" is seeded early and charged at closure, a positive. Mixed metaphor: shadows as "doorway" then "loom" shifts vehicle mid-image. Stock phrasing: "a vessel of breath and blood." Apply −0.6 for template runs and synonym churn ("steadily unpredictable…chaotic rhythm"), −0.3 for register drift into thesis-speak in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances situation or sensory accumulation. Sentence rhythm varies—long accumulative openings, short action beats ("He ran," "It fit with a satisfying...clunk"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor scaffold: "a trait that marked him as reactively visionary" tells rather than shows, but it's isolated. Metaphors are controlled ("hesitant ghosts," "islands of intimacy") and coherent. The staggered-interval sequence is clear and propulsive. Opening and closing images anchor and resolve cleanly. Zero filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Some minor scaffold appears: "Tonight, the air tasted of ozone and finality" followed immediately by the explanation of the hour's meaning feels slightly redundant. "Trembling certainty" and "fear vibrating in harmony with her absolute conviction" restate the same paradox without adding pressure. One paraphrase loop: the Fortress is introduced as "a metaphysical locus" then immediately glossed as housing "silent confessions and suppressed realities"—the second clause restates rather than advances. No template cadence runs or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "constellations of cold light trapped within the fog, forming walls and archways that drifted like breath in winter" stacks three metaphoric vehicles in quick succession.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied syntax and strong image density ("grey giants of the deep," "grooved numbers," "marrow rather than heard by the ear"). Rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing at the memory intrusion and settling into lyric cadence at closure. However, several lines carry slight overwriting: "chaotic instruments with a gentle reverence," "vast, unheard symphony," "resonant quiet that held the weight of love and water" stack figurative language without always adding new information. The phrase "empirically undeniable" in a peak beat feels academic rather than embodied. No loops or template cadence. Information density is high, but the elevated register in the final third creates mild drag. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is high; no causality breaks. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the accumulative design. However, several template stems recur: "He [verb]" in sequential lines (paragraphs 14–16: "He reached out," "He worked," "He applied," "He looked," "He realized"). Figurative density is heavy throughout ("kaleidoscope of refracted light," "rolling sea of glass," "layers of wet silk") without pattern-teaching or payoff that differentiates peak from setup. Stock metaphor ("cancer of this forbidden ritual") and filter verbs ("recognized," "welcomed," "realized") in mid-pressure beats reduce immediacy. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs on spatial mutiny repeat the rejection concept. Artifact spread touches multiple beats; apply −1.0 and disallow 9+ globally per the tightened Q7 rule.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often vivid ("chemical warmth," "ozone and old regrets"), with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats: "marinate in the uncomfortable silence," "stormed not by force, but by a sudden, fluid empathy," "employing the method of waiting actively" all risk register drift and overwriting. Several sentences explain rather than show: "a breach of social protocol, a tactical pause that made the Inspector's certainty begin to fray" tells us the effect instead of letting the silence land. Minor template cadence in the opening (three "was" constructions) and a paraphrase loop around "rigid thinking" / "concrete barriers" / "stark lines" reduce density. No major loops or artifacts touch the closure, but the figurative saturation in the middle third ("tilt on its axis," "fortress of his logic had been stormed") muddles momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., lamp buzz encodes era + tests timing). Sentence variety is good, though several paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" creating mild template cadence. One paraphrase loop: "fabricate it through invented histories" and "manufacture for a wealthy client" restate the same concept within three paragraphs. Figurative language is vivid but concentrated: "sky began to bleed," "phantom city," "ghost into the grain"—clustering risks overwriting but remains legible. The closure image is clean. Apply −0.6 for template stems and synonym churn; no artifacts touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template runs. Information density is high—most lines advance world, ritual, or tone. Word choice is precise ("curling like a dead leaf," "ambient noise of the port") without overwriting. However, some figurative language edges decorative: "breathing shroud," "resonant answer," "density of feeling" cluster without fresh vehicles. The phrase "erased histories" recurs three times with slight synonym variation ("forgotten," "unremembered"), approaching loop territory. The closure image is clean and propulsive. Overall strong line-level control with minor excesses in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully ("From his pocket, he withdrew a seashell…" vs. "He wedged the painted shell firmly…"), and information density is high. However, several beats loop or scaffold: "the question of whether the universe possessed an underlying narrative or if it was simply chaotic noise" is paraphrased as "The riddle of the universe was solving itself…the narrative wasn't absent, it was just buried" without added pressure. The closure paragraph stacks "gloomy cheerfulness peaking," "manic grin," and "satisfied" in close succession, flattening the affective gradient. Minor template cadence in mid-story ("He heard his university mentor…He heard his ex-wife…") adds −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery ("neon lights...bled rhythmically," "jagged, palm-sized fragment of granite"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, stakes, or action. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "reorganize the entire layout of the city, shifting the floating districts" restates the same action; "hopeful desperation" recurs as both mood and narrative summary without fresh embodiment. Template cadence in the middle section: "She was driven by," "She lived with," "She knew exactly" stacks similar stems. A few stock metaphors ("heart remained tethered," "orchestrating a massive urban ballet") are functional but not fresh. Filter-verb density is controlled and voice-motivated. No significant artifacts touch the closure beat, which remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive, with high information density ("clumsy, pressurized gloves," "slow-moving cerulean fluid"). The mechanical shutter click—"vibrated up his arm, a tactile confirmation"—is concrete and purposeful. However, mild overwriting appears in the closure beat: "atmosphere, though virtually nonexistent, seemed to heavyset with a profound weight" stacks qualifiers and uses "heavyset" awkwardly; "dawning hush" and "dawnlit melancholy" feel slightly elevated for the moment. A paraphrase loop occurs mid-story: "purposefully curious" is both shown (unauthorized summit visit) and told as a trait label. No major scaffolding or template cadence, but figurative language density ("razor-thin line of diamond-white light," "ghostly illumination," "sterile glare") clusters in the final beats without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no typos or pronoun drift. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance action or atmosphere. However, several phrases loop or pad: "a sanctuary of silence known simply as The Mender's Way" (the "sanctuary of silence" competes with "swirling gray chaos" one sentence prior without tension); "the vital organs of a living, breathing entity" is stock metaphor; "With trembling hands, the young woman presented the object" is followed immediately by a colon describing the object, creating a micro-stall. The phrase "Outside, the deep groan of metal against metal echoed through the depot as an anchor lifted for a ship's maiden voyage, the sound reverberating through the floorboards" contains redundancy (echoed/reverberating). Template cadence: "He moved instantly… He activated… He placed… He felt…" across four consecutive beats. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum at mid-story. Apply −0.8 for accumulated loops and template stems per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high. Opening and closing images are vivid and recharge motifs (silence, maps, convergence). Grammar and tense are clean. Two line-level issues: "The silence encompassing... wasn't peaceful; it was the heavy, suspended breath" stacks metaphors in adjacent clauses without tight causal link. "They coalesced, moved by the invisible magnetic fields of the ancient room" introduces unexplained world logic mid-beat, creating mild opacity. Minor template cadence in paragraph three: "He didn't need... he needed..." and "He knew how to read... even when the world tried..." repeat stems without variation. Combined artifacts total ~−0.6 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening paragraph's long, weighted clauses shift to sharper, action-driven syntax during the orchestration sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, method, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent phrases: "wild hush" bookends the piece without added pressure, and "infinitely patient" is repeated verbatim. The metaphor "ebony tuning fork…swallowing noise" is vivid, but "pulsing with a warning" in the same beat feels slightly mixed. No loops or clarity failures touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies effectively: long, layered sentences open and close the piece, while short urgent beats ("Her lungs burned") drive the middle. Information density is high; most lines advance pressure or setting. Minor loop: "forcing her trembling fingers to move with slow, deliberate precision despite the fear clawing at her throat" restates the override concept already established. "Sealing the forgotten underwater temple in a tomb of eternal twilight" front-loads weight but remains clear. Figurative language occasionally clusters ("crushing weight," "heavy velvet curtain") without obscuring causality. Zero critical artifacts at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentences carry rhythm and controlled figurative language ("metallic stillness," "breathless interval"), but several phrases loop conceptually without advancing pressure: "the noise of his father's lies" and "secrets told in the dark" restate rather than deepen. The escape sequence layers metaphor densely—"dissolving into the geometry of the lattice," "copper light flared once, bright and blinding"—without clarifying the mechanics, risking opacity at the closure beat. Stock constructions like "he found his exit" and "took a deep breath" dilute momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and momentum is largely maintained, with strong opening and closing anchors. Information density is high in the transaction beat and the final image. However, several phrases carry decorative overwriting: "lovingly venomous," "ephemeral cameo appearances," "ashen-veil ghost bride," and "mournful elation" stack figurative or paradoxical language without on-page dramatization, reading as label-driven rather than embodied. The phrase "a universe of unsaid things" in the penultimate paragraph is abstract filler. No paraphrase loops or template cadence are present, and spatial choreography remains clear. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, weaving setting, character, and action into most sentences. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "somnambulant grace," "hauntingly optimistic," "sedative atmosphere," and "desperate faith" stack modifiers where concrete verbs would propel. The opening paragraph loops conceptually—"submerged metropolis" and "tidal clock" restate the same tidal-city mechanic without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "She did not move... but began to navigate... Her body swayed... With every turn... She began to sew..." creates a drumbeat rhythm. Minor artifacts (synonym churn around "closure," "ruin," "decay") do not obscure causality but dull momentum. The final image—"a single stitched scar"—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive, with strong imagery ("roots...snaked between the limestone ribs," "dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight"). Rhythm varies purposefully across paragraphs. Minor template cadence in paragraph two: "She moved...She followed...She felt" stacks three identical subject-verb stems without variation. Overwriting appears in the final paragraph: "a surge of connection that traveled from her fingertips to the marrow of the earth" and "rooted now as deeply as the olive trees that drew life from the history beneath them" layer metaphors densely without adding pressure. No loops or causality breaks, but the closing beat could be tightened by half to increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sensory detail is vivid and selective. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the moment before a letter is mailed" is elaborated twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "He pulled... smoothed... began to write... chose... paused... folded." Some figurative density approaches overwriting: "absorbing morning light," "glass and steel enclosing," "chaos and peril of the physical world" stack metaphors in service of atmosphere rather than propulsion. The ending paragraph delivers closure procedurally rather than charging the final image with compressed rhythm. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, but momentum sags mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening lines anchor acoustic texture and setting. Information density is high in the ritual sequence (flame, nebula filament, quantum foam, synchronization). Minor scaffold appears: "She was a galaxy-chart embroiderer, but her medium was not merely silk and light; it was the fabric of truth itself" over-explains rather than trusting prior dramatization. "The silence of the room seemed to deepen, pressing against her ears" is vivid but the next sentence ("She was unraveling conspiracies by stitching them into plain sight") restates the concept without advancing pressure. No loops or template cadence in peak beats; copy is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well ("humid air hung heavy," "hissed and fused") and figurative language is purposeful without overwriting. The phrase "a choir of weeping violins" and "the glass wept" are evocative but border on stock lyricism. One paraphrase loop: "unsent letters" is thematically named three times (title cue, shelf description, Elara's dialogue) without fresh detail each time. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no scaffold or syntax monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or symbolic weight. Template opening (heavy doors, mist, silence) is generic but swift. Overwriting cluster in paragraph one: "debris of the procedure," "calcified texture," "tangled neural pathways," "manifestation of memories he could not erode"—four metaphoric vehicles in quick succession without pattern-teaching, risking density saturation (−0.5). "Lotus-hearted ache" is register drift (−0.3). Paraphrase loop: "unknot the tightness" and later "unknotted the narrative" recycles the same vehicle. Closure beat is clean. Deductions total approximately −0.8 within Q7 only, per Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action). Opening and closing lines anchor well. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. However, the piece leans on elevated figurative language throughout (e.g., "spectral landscape," "prismatic glow," "electric energy," "cathedral of light") without pattern-teaching or payoff; in a high-pressure beat this could dull immediacy, but here it coheres with the lyric daydream mode. Minor: "inextricably" misused; "sensation of pensive mirth" repeats the label twice without fresh embodiment. Clarity and propulsion are strong overall, justifying mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully across beats; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the opening and close, though the dream layers include some paraphrase loops ("He gasped, snapping his eyes open" / "Then the train whistle screamed... forcing a third awakening"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "the heavy coat of knowing dissolved" and "the universe was not a puzzle to be solved, but a song to be heard" are vivid and voice-motivated. The phrase "bewitch his senses, dragging him downward" and "the air grew thick and strange" border on stock phrasing but serve the lyric mode. No major clarity breaks; the nested structure remains legible. Template cadence (repeated awakening structure) is purposeful and pays off at closure, so no deduction there.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm generally supports urgency—short bursts during the raid, longer sentences for world-building—but several loops and scaffolds blunt momentum: "a notification that the Revenue Service was actively auditing" unpacks the metaphor too neatly; "the seed shattered, not into dust, but into a sound" uses the not-X-but-Y template without tight necessity. "Converging chaos" in the ending paragraph is告知d rather than embodied. Information density is high in world-building beats, but the garden-club paragraph reads as insert rather than woven action. No metaphor muddles, and grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between subject-first and inverted constructions. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, ritual mechanics, or emotional state. Two paraphrase moments weaken propulsion: "The growth was not violent or explosive; rather, it was shyly unstoppable" restates in adjacent phrases, and "He would still wander these halls, sleepless and watching" echoes earlier insomnia exposition. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "photosynthesize pain into beauty" and "blossom armistice" recur with purpose. The scaffold phrase "It was time to" signals a transition that could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled. Information density is high, with layered descriptions advancing atmosphere and world-building simultaneously. A paraphrase loop appears: "sound began to light the fracture" followed by "the light acting as both thread and needle" restates the same sealing mechanism without added pressure (−0.2). Overwriting in the opening third (multiple adjacent lines of figurative language without pattern-taught payoff: "cathedral of iridescent stone," "shadow amidst brilliance," "accumulated breath of history") clusters metaphor for atmospheric effect rather than causal work (−0.4). No loops or template cadence touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clarity is generally strong with varied syntax and concrete action. Information density is good—most lines advance situation or atmosphere. However, decorative stacking appears: "terrible, breathless moment," "carefully reckless precision," "cautious exuberance that dared to hope"—modifier pairs that blur rather than sharpen. The phrase "the universe trying to align with the absolute reality she was inscribing" is conceptually muddy. Minor paraphrase loop: "the walls of their estrangement crumbled" following "no lie could exist" restates the same effect. Template cadence in middle beats: multiple sentences begin with participial action structures.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; sentences often do double duty (e.g., glow-lamp → envelope discovery → resin analysis → hidden message). Rhythm varies, but several mid-paragraph descriptors lean ornate: "dappled resolve, a determination speckled with the terror of treason yet brightened by the clarity of his purpose" paraphrases the same emotional state without added pressure. Minor template cadence in the adhesive-analysis paragraph (multiple clauses stacking technical terms). No major loops or scaffolding, and the final image is clear. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "speckled" and "brightened" within one phrase risks metaphor mixing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong images ("paradoxical perfume of dry rot and germinating mold," "ferrous stone," "convection currents"). Rhythm varies and sentences mostly advance the story. However, several artifacts appear: "the silence of his sanctuary was broken not by the cooing of his flock, but by" is template negation; "blooming withering" recurs four times, twice in quick succession in the climax, becoming overly schematic; "he realized that preserving the song required him to let go of the silence" is expository summary of a beat that warrants dramatization through image alone. The dust-mote ritual is vivid and propulsive, but the final paragraph drifts into abstraction ("shared hope that the wind from another world would eventually find its way back") rather than landing on a concrete image. No loops or major filter-verb stacks, but the closure beat is softened by exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character insight, or concept. The wood-grain analysis demonstrates strong propulsion. Minor issues: "featherly determined" is immediately glossed as "delicate but unyielding," creating a micro-loop; "broken into jagged shards of quiet" and later "fractured hush" recycle the shattered-silence idea. The logbook moment ("METAR 00000KT CAVOK") integrates technical detail cleanly. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is largely clean with vivid imagery ("vertical abyss," "living galaxy"), but several passages carry overwriting and filter stacks: "she had spent her life mapping," "hoping that the pressure," "she had come to map the land." The phrase "a shadowseam wonder" and "luminous respite" read as ornamental coinages without clear denotation, blurring sense in peak beats. Template cadence appears in reflection blocks ("She had descended... She had come... She placed"). Paraphrase loop: the burnt feather's symbolism is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. The shared-exhale beat is specific and propulsive, but the surrounding frame leans verbose.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "ancient, vanished ocean" echoed in "ghosts of tides that had receded millennia ago"; "motivation was singular and obsessed" followed by the same idea rephrased. The metaphor "sharp grief... jagged streaks of indigo" and "fear... trembling waves of sick chartreuse" works cleanly, but "transliterates emotions into visible spectrums of light" stacks three abstract nouns in high-pressure beats. Template-cadence patterns in the middle third ("She picked up... It possessed... It began...") create a slight drumbeat. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence combined, per the artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean, but overwriting clusters in the opening: "disassembled pocket watch," "calculated wilderness of rotting wood and neon," "desperate, burning need to serenade monotony with creativity" layer figurative language densely without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Minor template cadence in action sequence: "The bishop tipped... It struck... bounced... landed... The can... rolled... slammed..." (−0.3). Information density is high in the cascade beat, and sensory detail is specific, lifting the score back toward mid-6s. No loops or scaffolding, and the final image is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings vary and paragraphs create visual rhythm, but several lines carry overwriting and figurative density without clear payoff: "pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin," "obsidian grace," "fledge, branching out rapidly beneath the dermis like the sprouting wings of a mythical creature," and "spontaneously anchored, the fluid light hardening and locking" stack metaphor and elevated diction in quick succession, blurring the physical process. "Sharp, clarifying force" is abstract; "rewrote the energy fields of her body" tells rather than shows. A paraphrase loop appears in paragraphs 18–19: "The verse told the story of the ocean's pull... It was a map home, written in the language of gravity" restates the same content without added pressure. Propulsion is present but momentum sags under the decorative load. Clarity holds, but concision and information density suffer when figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without tightening the physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clean grammar and spatial clarity. Deductions: minor loops and paraphrase ("not flaws to be hidden, but essential facets" / "not garbage; it was the only medium capable") and template-like parallelism ("He had constructed…intended not as…but as"; "did not cast…but with") in adjacent lines. Stock metaphor "cathedral of refracted radiance" and elevated diction ("kaleidoscope of indigo, violet, and burning orange") in the closure beat slightly dull immediacy. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he saw") cluster in the middle section without voice-motivated purpose. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, −0.3 for stock metaphor in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening paragraph. Template cadence appears in the final third: "He thought about… He sought to… By accepting…" runs three consecutive "He [verb]" stems during a peak reflective beat, triggering −0.4. "Hard softness," "gently skilled," and "a harsh caress that matched the duality of his soul" stack paradoxical phrasing without clear payoff, reducing propulsion. The closure image is clear, but figurative density ("translate," "enlighten the void," "silent speech of the night") in quick succession blurs the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines advance the action or world logic. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene needs. However, several lines edge toward overwriting: "serene upheaval, a sensation akin to the earth taking a deep, restorative breath" and "the energy radiated downward, beginning to revitalize the color of the moss" stack figurative language without clear propulsion. Two near-paraphrase moments: "perfect, glowing orb" followed by "swelled into a perfect...orb" and the dual assertions that hope is engineered (once in action, once in summary). These artifacts reduce momentum slightly but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. The loop/scaffold penalty is modest (−0.4) and does not touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies across survey (clipped technical) and discovery (denser, more reflective). Information density is high; most sentences advance through layered action-and-perception. Three penalties: (1) Paraphrase loop: "his true motivation was far more esoteric: to discover what walls dream about" repeats the concept without added pressure (−0.2). (2) Stock metaphor: "dark throat of the building" (−0.3). (3) Template cadence in paragraph four: "He found… The leather bindings were… The handwriting inside was…" runs three consecutive subject-verb stems (−0.4). The final image "changed and somber, finally revealing" is propulsive. No figurative muddle in peak beats. Overall clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the middle beats (lullaby mechanics, light weaving). However, several lines carry decorative weight without advancing pressure: "a weaver of light whom few had ever seen" adds mystique but no stakes; "settling over the spires in a dusky harmony that blurred the sharp edges of the world" is pretty but static. The phrase "heavy with the weight of regret and a singular, crushing failure" stacks near-synonyms. Minor template cadence in the opening (multiple sentences beginning with setting description). No loops or causality breaks, but figurative density in non-peak beats reduces propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. The opening establishes who/where/when efficiently. However, several paraphrase loops and stock phrases dull momentum: "a task akin to drawing fresh water from a stone" is cliché; "the silence changed…no longer the silence of held breath" restates itself; "flawed beauty" and "terrified to breathe" lean generic. Metaphor density is high without pattern-teaching: "swallowing the moonlight," "wounded beasts," "pristine…undeniably human" stack in adjacent beats. Template cadence: "He was…He did not want…He needed" in paragraph two. Artifact penalty: −0.6 for loops and template stems that touch the closure third ("the silence changed" restates across two sentences in the final paragraph).

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and many lines carry double duty (setting as character state, gesture as theme). However, figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "blinding geometry," "white scar," "velvet depths," "sky bruised purple," "tattered veil," "broken porcelain plate" cluster in nearly every paragraph, occasionally mixing vehicles (veil, plate, scar). Paraphrase loop: "He did not come here to apologize to ghosts, but to preserve the echo" / "he could not bear the total absence of the music" restates the same motive. Template cadence: "He looked down... He followed... He withdrew... He did not come... He was not keeping... He knew... He stood up... He closed his eyes... He had silenced... He turned his back... He walked away" across the second half flattens propulsion. Stock metaphor "broken porcelain plate" and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("architecture of his soul") in peak beats trigger artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase: "the absolute absence of noise felt violent" and "alarming serenity" restate the same idea; "her beauty was a mesmerizing distraction" and "a planned paradox" are near-synonyms within two sentences. The metaphor "like spilled ink on a blank page" is vivid, but "bodily poetic" reads as an abstract label rather than a concrete image.句子 openings vary, and the prose is mostly clear, but the closure paragraph stacks modifiers ("pure, unadulterated sound," "messy, beautiful humanity," "glorious, deafening roar") that elevate diction without advancing sense. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the cumulative scaffold reduces propulsion mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in key beats: "the sword un-striking, the insults un-spoken, the tears un-falling, retreating into the painted eyes" drives momentum efficiently. However, "uncommonly serene" appears three times without functional variation, and the phrase "half-lit epiphanies" + "shadowy, ambiguous understanding" + "peer into the gloom" loops the darkness-requires-effort concept across adjacent paragraphs. Minor filter-verb stacking in the opening ("felt less like," "intended to answer") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, but several figurative phrases stack without adding new pressure: "vibrating threads," "blushing stillness," "bruised sky," "silence expanded." The phrase "the atmosphere around him deepened into a blushing stillness, the sky turning a soft, embarrassed pink" layers metaphor on metaphor in one beat. "Transiently rooted" and "a conduit, planted in the earth" loop the same concept across adjacent lines. Template stems appear: "He understood…yet he perceived"; "It was a…It was a moth wing." Momentum remains intact, but density occasionally dips into scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance action or deepen stakes. Rhythm varies (short urgent beats during activation, longer contemplative ones framing the process). Clarity remains strong through technical choreography. Three distinct issues lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loop ("a perfect void remained, waiting to be filled" echoes "empty space where the paper memory had once been" two paragraphs later); (2) "fierce, burning vitality" + "thawing the numbness" stacks fire metaphors densely in the opening; (3) "illuminate with a blinding, pulsating violet radiance" overmodifies a single beat. Applying Non-closure Accumulation Cap: −0.8 for paraphrase + metaphor density, confined to non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies; opening sentence is syntactically ambitious and legible. Information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "The wind outside began to shriek...an hour from now in a flash of premonition" fuses setting, sound, and temporal twist). Minor loop: "she saw...she saw" in paragraph 3 is mildly repetitive but purposeful parallelism. Overwriting in the dreamscape passage: "fields of static and swirling starlight, washing away the grime" stacks metaphor without clear vehicle coherence. Stock phrase: "with a trembling breath that bridged her past and future" is poetic but edges generic. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks. Figurative density is elevated but does not obscure the peak beat (seal-break, lever-pull).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong sensory detail and purposeful diction. Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances setting, character trait, or ritual mechanics. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several loops and synonym cycles accumulate: "efficient execution" / "absolute efficiency"; "secured" knowledge / "safely hidden"; "narrow corridors" and "labyrinthine corridors" in close proximity. Stock phrases appear: "the flight of the last...monarch and the encroaching thunder of...drums," "the suspended silence." Template cadence is detectable in paired "he did not...instead, he..." constructions. These artifacts cluster in the opening third and middle, not the closure beat, limiting deduction under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, but they prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "scheming pacifist" / "orchestrating complex deceptions" / "schemer's cold calculation"; "dimensional trap" / "pocket of existence" / "sanctuary"; "fundamental shatter" / "perception of strength" restate without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate: "This was…," "It was…," "The [noun] was…" open consecutive paragraphs mechanically. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats: "chokehold," "cage," "key," "entry point," "evolution rather than defeat." Filter-verb stacks appear ("felt the potential music," "felt like falling") where immediacy would sharpen the moment. Register drift into pseudo-mystical abstraction ("cellular memory," "forbidden technique," "shifting grace") clashes with the tactical setup. These artifacts touch the closure beat (cylinder rolling away) and spread across the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density ("fragile, menacing clarity," "jagged diamonds," "colors that did not exist in nature"). Rhythm varies purposefully. However, template cadence appears in the breath-cycle paragraph ("In, out, in, out") and "He [verb]" stems recur ("He waited," "He inhaled," "He adjusted," "He had managed"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff in some beats ("rigid line," "formless mist," "towering cathedral of ice," "sculpture of brilliant, hard light" cluster in the final third). These artifacts dull immediacy slightly but do not obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor issues: "the telltale scent of a magical contract gone sour" leans on generic fantasy diction, and "With trembling fingers, she didn't stitch the wound shut but instead tied the edges together loosely" uses a weak negative construction where a direct verb would sharpen. The phrase "the concept of deciduous vows" arrives as naked exposition mid-paragraph rather than woven into Elara's thought process. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and figurative language serves pressure (trees as "construct of weeping light," leaves with "the distinct, dry sound of turning pages"). However, several beats lean toward elevated register that borders on overwriting: "luminous anxiety," "vertiginous jolt," "mingled with the solar wind" cluster in mid-to-high pressure moments without full dramatic justification. The opening's "suspiciously like radiation" and bathroom's "rhythmic mantra" demonstrate stronger economy. Information density is high, but two adjacent sentences in the shell-examination beat paraphrase the inheritance paradox slightly ("nonlinear inheritance that defied all biological logic" followed immediately by timeline explanation).

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rich in figurative language, but density becomes a drag: nearly every sentence in the opening third stacks metaphors ("phantom resonance," "grammar of stone," "narrative abyss," "formatting of the central chasm") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating ornamental weight rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "unheard symphony" in paragraph one resurfaces as "unheard symphony of the cavern" later with no added meaning. Template cadence: "She did not draw… nor did she cast…; instead, she opened…" is functional but mechanical. The golem negotiation—the climactic beat—is told in expository summary ("It was a gamble…") rather than enacted moment-by-moment, flattening the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and imagistic: "heavy mist… less like weather and more like a shroud," "vines of iron and oxidation climbed the walls, blooming with rust-colored flowers that smelled of salt and old perfume." Information density is high, and the read-aloud ear is mostly clean. However, several lines lean toward overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff: "colossal monument to trapped freedom," "bordering on madness," "biological duality," "labyrinthine hull." The phrase "unkindled solace" appears only once, late, without prior seeding. Paraphrase loop: "recapture… recapture" in adjacent sentences. Minor template cadence in the garden sequence ("She sought… She felt… She looked"). Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and the prose propels cleanly through the repair sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the engine of history was disconnected from the bell of the present" is immediately restated via the rope description; "coaxed them with a patient hand" echoes "warmly methodical." Template cadence in the middle third: "He did not force…instead, he coaxed" / "He was not merely tying…he was editing reality." Stock metaphor "breathing of brass gears" and the phrase "fables of absence" repeated without fresh inflection. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems; the artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the peak beat. However, minor scaffold appears: "It was here…that she hoped" and "It was a grim…sort of peace" repeat the expository "It was" stem within close proximity. "The stone sang, releasing a sound that was not loud, but incredibly dense" could compress. Information density is high in the mapkeeper details. The final image carries momentum without muddle. No loops touch the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structure shifts between compact action beats and longer descriptive passages. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent: "tapestry of rust and shadow," "terrifying, expectant vacuum," "thistle-blown hope." However, several phrases risk overwriting or mixed metaphor: "a universe drowning in the chaotic noise of entropy" stacks abstractions; "the stars were watching" anthropomorphizes after establishing starlight as mechanical energy. Minor template cadence in the ladder-climb sequence ("She reached… With trembling hands… The shard reacted…") and one paraphrase loop (paragraph five repeats the urgency of silence collapsing). No clarity-breaking artifacts, but density occasionally edges into purple without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong sensory specificity ("cauterized the parchment with lines of fire," "geological silence"). Rhythm varies and sentences carry high information density. Two frictions: "the epoch after fog becomes solid" and "summer-quill archivist of the Third Era" front-load exposition without dramatic anchor, creating slight scaffolding. The phrase "moved with agonizing slowness" in paragraph four is a tempo label rather than shown perception. No loops or template cadence; clarity is high.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the piece advances through every line. However, mild overwriting appears in stacked metaphors without pattern payoff: "bruised purple hour," "blindfold of night," "gravity of hopelessness," and "beautiful decay" cluster in the opening third. The phrase "treating the dangerous explosives with the whimsy of a parlor trick" tells what was shown two lines earlier. One paraphrase loop: "filter the sensory input" followed immediately by "feeling the slickness of the dew... to gauge" restates the same awareness without added pressure. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so accumulation cap applies: −0.8 for two distinct issues (metaphor density, minor paraphrase loop).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies (short "Now, however" pivot vs. longer foresight sentence); information density is high (cicada both grounds and symbolizes). Clarity holds throughout. Minor issues: "warmly observant nature" is slightly label-like; "solid coolness…grounded her warmly" creates a temperature contradiction (coolness/warmly). "The final, sharp consonant of his resignation" is elegant but borders on purple given the rest is plainer. "Fibrous and tough, like the husk of a coconut floating between islands" is a strained vehicle—coconuts don't typically float *between* islands as a known image. These keep the score sub-8.0 but don't obscure closure. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies and density is high; many lines serve double duty (the doll both trap and vessel, the trellis both welcome and constraint). Minor scaffold: "disturbingly intangibly tangible" muddles with contradictory modifiers; "the cramped dark" loops "cramped" within one beat; "presence bloomed" and "presence of peace" recycle the noun. Template-cadence runs ("It was…") across four sentences slightly flatten propulsion. No loops touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits total deduction to −0.8; base ~8.0 adjusted to 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is generally high, but several beats carry figurative density without full payoff: "fluidly logical" and "liquid reasoning" repeat the same concept across two sentences, and "silence here was wild and feral, often terrifying" stacks modifiers redundantly. Template cadence appears in the opening paragraph with repeated "the" + noun stems. The closure image (kaleidoscope, warm ambers, steady hand) is vivid and propulsive, but the mid-section "mimicking the chaotic weather systems…organizing them into predictable, flowing streams" paraphrases itself within one sentence. Minor loops lower momentum without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries multiple text artifacts: "her nature wisely adventurous" is filter-heavy and label-like; "evoke a deep sense of futuristic nostalgia" over-explains; the final two sentences loop thematically ("Lore Keeper had become the ruler, bridging the gap" then "nostalgia faded into resolve"). Template cadence appears in the mural-peeling sequence ("she sliced," "the surface curled," "she worked," "every layer removed"). These accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Syntax varies purposefully—long, suspended clauses during stasis ("Yet, she remained trapped…"), short declaratives at release ("The heavy iron ring fell"). Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line charges closure. Two mild frictions: "the silence around her possessing a heavy, loaded emptiness that pressed" stacks modifiers without adding clarity (−0.2), and "He had shown the suffocating girl that the air was hers to claim" shifts to labeled summary instead of staying in image (−0.3). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm supports scene momentum without template cadence. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clear, propulsive, and information-dense. Sentence openings vary, rhythm accelerates during the climax, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. Figurative language ("shadows stitched together," "phantom ocean") is coherent and purposeful. Minor elevation in diction ("petrichor," "superposition") fits the concept-heavy world without obscuring clarity. The final image is concrete and leaves no scaffolding. Zero loops, strong momentum, and clean mechanics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings diversify, and information density is high—most lines advance stakes, physics, or interiority. The standing-wave sequence is clear and propulsive. Minor overwriting: "swirling dust-motes," "heavy, golden shadows," "ancient bones grinding together inside a metal ribcage" cluster figurative language in descriptive beats without full dramatic payoff. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; pronoun references remain unambiguous throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with vivid imagery (translucent spun glass, weeping lead bark) integrated into action. However, the piece carries mild overwriting in figurative clusters ("primordial soup of creation," "chaotic, beautiful flux") and occasional synonym churn ("thick with the scent," "stagnant air," "opaque void" in quick succession). The final paragraph stacks metaphors (shivering bliss, cold ecstatic electricity, blood to light) without clear physical grounding, which slightly dulls momentum at the closure beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, method, and character together. However, several ornamental phrases slow momentum: "navigated the narrow canyons of corrugated cardboard" and "spirit eroded by the relentless friction of documented tragedy against cold paper" are figurative but not propulsive. The phrase "accumulated dust patterns" repeats across paragraphs without variation. The final beat is clean, so non-closure deductions are capped at −0.4, but the decorative openings and one loop keep this mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences are generally clear and varied, but several passages show template cadence and elevated diction that slows momentum: "the tyranny of indifference that had settled over the populace like a suffocating blanket," "the beauty of the toxic water was undeniable, a gilded shroud covering the decay beneath." Stock metaphors ("breath before a scream," "ghost in the machine") and abstract constructions ("coded freedom," "weapon against oblivion") cluster in high-pressure beats, reducing immediacy. Information density is strong in the middle third (puddle-map, lagoon approach), but the final paragraph summarizes effect rather than dramatizing micro-actions. No major loops or pronoun drift, and spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance action or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images frame the cycle cleanly. However, several adjacent lines paraphrase: "Lines of hard, red light began to trace geometric patterns" followed immediately by description of the same visual phenomenon; "the ancient mechanism stirred" then "This was the threat" restates without adding pressure. Minor template stems ("He brought... He played... He constructed") cluster mid-story. "Quietly vivid" contradicts itself as a descriptor. These patterns don't obscure causality but dull propulsion in non-closure beats. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase/template issues under the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, information density is high, and figurative language is controlled ("floating continent of root and leaf," "eyelashes," "breaking icicle"). No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Clarity and momentum are maintained throughout. Minor friction: "soft, breathing silence" in the penultimate paragraph leans toward stock lyricism, and "swelled" + "confirming" in the final paragraph introduce slight emotional summary where image alone would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor scaffold appears: "a paradox of confidence and doubt that made his hands tremble" restates "uncertainly certain" without added pressure, and "a guide for those willing to accept that the path is never a straight line" leans explanatory in the final beat. No significant loops or template cadence runs, and figurative language ("rustling blizzard," "vegetation warred with gravity") remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong imagery ("branching out like jagged lightning," "map of his limitations"), but several ornamental constructions slow momentum: "factually mystical" is a conceptual oxymoron that muddies rather than sharpens, and phrases like "luminous regret that seemed to brighten the dim workspace" edge into abstraction. Minor paraphrase loop: "the gold began to sweat and liquefy" followed closely by "reached a state of hyper-fluidity." Template cadence appears in stacked "She [verb]" stems across paragraphs 10–12. Information density is high in the alchemical sequence, but opening exposition ("a collection of phonetic vibrations that exerted a measurable gravitational force") leans tell-heavy. No major clarity breaks, and the closure image is vivid. These patterns accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies across beats; information density is high (each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict). Clarity is strong with no pronoun confusion or tense drift. Minor deductions: the phrase "a sensation of luminous ache—a poignant, glowing sadness that signaled the final release. It was a beautiful pain, the feeling of a wound finally closing" contains paraphrase-loop elements (luminous ache → glowing sadness → beautiful pain → wound closing) that restate the same emotional content without added pressure. One template-cadence run: "The ghost roared... demanding... The General stared... trembling... A tremor went through..." uses parallel "[subject] [verb]..." stems across three beats. Total artifact load: −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory specificity is high ("ozone and burnt sugar," "pewter mask strap," "sickly, vibrant hum"). Information density is strong in the first two-thirds. However, minor loops appear: "The air burned his lungs, searing and holy" closely echoes prior sensory saturation without new pressure. The closure paragraph stacks elevated abstractions—"symmetrical distribution," "integer of his own survival," "violent, beautiful calculus"—that blur the final image's concreteness. Figurative density in the final beat ("calculus of atonement") risks overwriting when a sharper physical anchor would land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the lens-fragment sequence, where sensory and metaphysical detail layer without redundancy. However, several adjacent lines paraphrase the same concept: "These anchors were elusively tangible, feeling solid enough to grip yet slipping through his mental fingers like smoke" followed immediately by navigation "by instinct" through "liminal space"—synonym churn that softens momentum. The phrase "eternal instant" and "breathless pause" also loop conceptually. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally stacks without escalation (soot dissolves, storm-tossed ocean, defiant lighthouse, cold spray, scream of metal—five images in rapid succession). No grammatical errors; clarity remains high despite minor textural density.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; most sentences do double duty (e.g., "These cracks in the façade were not just structural failures; they were physical manifestations of the broken illusion"). Some overwriting appears in the opening: "claustrophobic confines," "weightless burden, a pressing heaviness that possessed no physical mass" stacks metaphor density without clear payoff. Minor paraphrase loop: "The ghosts faded back into the woodwork, their vigil ended, leaving Elias alone" restates the closure beat without added pressure. Sentence openings show some variety but default to "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems across multiple lines. Information density is high and technical detail (pilot mechanism, hydraulic valves, clockwork timer) integrates cleanly. No filter-verb stacks or major loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("fingerprints of the old universe," "bottled whisper"). Two minor issues: "rustling awakenings" repeats as both concept and phrase without evolving meaning, and "spiderweb fracture shot out" + "books fell" + "clouds boiled up" stacks three major events in quick succession with minimal causal connective tissue. Information density is high. No loops or template cadence. Sentence openings vary. Clarity holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense—"vessel of burnished sorrow," "dust of years," "silver tongues"—but the metaphor density approaches overwriting in a high-pressure scene without clear pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphors appear: "muting their silver tongues" anthropomorphizes mirrors, then "leaving the room blind" shifts the vehicle. Template cadence in Elian's action sequence: "He draped… leaving… He paused… reaching… holding…" Stock phrasing: "framed against," "the authority of the general returning." The final paragraph's "gold dust" and "burnished sorrow" loop back without adding pressure. Paraphrase loop: "he knew that even a reimagined past could not bring back the dead" restates the closure effect just shown. Apply −0.8 for density + mixed metaphor + template stems touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, figurative density is high throughout ("memory than a sound," "kaleidoscope of ruby shadows," "choir of metal birds," "dizzying waltz of physics and magic"), and some metaphors strain coherence ("light...as a golden, audible clarity"). Paraphrase loops appear: "mending what isn't torn" is restated in "reinforcing the strength...rather than fighting its failures," and "he had not fixed the machine; he had simply reminded it" recycles the same conceptual ground. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs, but the elevated diction and occasional redundancy lower momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled: "limestone cliffs that loomed like bleached bones," "silence so thick it felt like physical pressure." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, setting, or action. Two minor texture issues: "Down here, the atmosphere possessed a resonant hush" and then "a silence so thick" repeat the same sensory claim within three sentences (paraphrase loop, −0.2). "The psychometric resonance of the compass had led him to the lock, but he needed to provide the torque" mixes metaphor (psychic echo / mechanical lock-torque) without clear vehicle coherence (−0.3). Figurative language is dense but mostly legible; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops in the opening third ("the dominant sound was…Its ceaseless rotation induced…This trance was…") restate the reverie concept across adjacent lines, and some figurative language stacks without earning its keep ("terrifyingly complex variables," "singular, elemental truth"). The climax beat—projecting the map—is clear and propulsive. Proofreading is clean, and no causality-breaking artifacts appear, but synonym churn around "complexity/simplicity" and conceptual labels slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and vivid imagery. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the flower was not merely opening; it was signaling" restates without adding pressure. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching ("umbral tenderness," "suspended autumn," "ghostly signal," "lighthouse for the lost"), risking overwriting. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through concrete action. Sentence openings vary, but information density could be tighter in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and propulsion are adequate; no major loops or causality breaks. However, several lines carry overwriting: "a searing reverie that distorted the air like a mirage" stacks metaphor without added precision; "the deafening psychic static of the loop rendered her voice useless, tearing spoken words into unintelligible shreds" paraphrases itself. Template cadence appears in the debris-arrangement sequence: "She gathered… she formed… she added…" Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching ("wrought-iron gantry," "oval shadow," "psychic resonance," "shimmering light") and some vehicles are generic ("like a physical stone," "like an open oven"). No filter-verb stacks or profound artifacts, but rhythm does not modulate with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings show variety. Information density is high in the conception sequence. Minor template cadence appears: "She visualized... She had to maintain... She channeled... She added" clusters four similar stems in quick succession, creating a drumbeat effect that slightly flattens momentum during the peak beat. The phrase "cognitive genesis" and "psychic energy" read as elevated diction not fully rooted in the established voice. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold, and the final image is crisp. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or causality. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("velvet disquiet," "holographic pattern," "brass throat"). Minor overwriting in the opening: "groaning mid-bellow," "verdant isolation," "plush, suffocating weight," and "velvet disquiet" cluster without clear escalation. The immersion sequence is crisp and propulsive. The architect's voice emerging "faint and tinny" from the liquid is concrete and evocative. Final line recharges the "velvet disquiet" motif effectively. No loops or scaffold, clear syntax throughout. The density stays just shy of muddle but never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence-level craft is ambitious with strong figurative density ("crystalline pause in the cosmic breath," "friction that shouldn't exist"), but multiple ornamental metaphors cluster in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, risking overwriting. The phrase "furiously tranquil" is labeled twice without embodied dramatization. Minor scaffold appears: "It was a…" openers recur, and some lines paraphrase ("Using its cup-like shape to catch the scattered light" restates the acorn cap's function without added pressure). Information density is high, and rhythm varies, but the closure beat leans on abstract interiority ("electric resonance of the stolen past") rather than concrete action. No major loops or clarity breaks, but figurative muddle in peak moments and filter-verb stacks ("began working," "concentrated on") slightly dull immediacy. Artifacts touch mid-story beats but not the final image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Clarity and momentum are strong through the peak choice. Minor scaffold/loop pattern: "he knew" appears three times in the final third with similar syntax, and some figurative language clusters without always advancing pressure ("bruising purple shadows," "crystalline shifting"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs that obscure causality. Propulsion is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives during the meteor's approach, longer flowing syntax in reflection. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor scaffold appears in the penultimate paragraph ("not a defeat but a revelation," "not dying; it was becoming light") where synonym pairs explain rather than dramatize, and the closing line's abstraction ("the willingness to burn was the only way to truly be seen") tells rather than showing. No loops or template cadence; figurative language is dense but coherent. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats during the woman's approach, longer cadences in the ritual). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent philosophical blocks ("The agreement was ancient and messy" followed by "Since the Veil tore...that pact had unraveled") that restate the covenant's breach. A few elevated metaphors ("riot of cobalt," "visual screaming") in high-concentration risk overwriting but remain legible. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; specificity (petrified honeycomb, lead from bullet casings) anchors vivid images. Overall propulsion is strong with one diagnostic −0.4 for adjacent restatement of the covenant concept.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clarity and propulsion are solid; information density is high. Two paraphrase loops: "toxic green skyline churn with illogical storms" / "fluctuating mathematics of the atmosphere" (lines 1–3), and "texture of time passing" / "gritty, linear progression rather than slippery, subjective fog" (line 5) restate without added pressure. Template cadence in the descent sequence ("She descended… her heart racing… She knelt… her hands shaking") stacks participles across three moves. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy; cumulative penalty −0.3 for loops, −0.4 for template stems = −0.7 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("scrubbed the sky until it was raw," "frayed horizon," "tuning fork hum"). Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, creating decorative density rather than propulsive clarity. Mixed metaphor: "dragging the ink of the water upward" and "stitching clouds into a stanza" blur physical and metaphorical planes without coherent vehicle. Template cadence in the ritual sequence: "He did not…rather, he…" and "To begin, he required…" read as scaffolding. The overwriting and metaphor muddle in peak beats (kite snap, final weaving) trigger Q7 penalties and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during action ("He withdrew a heavy spool"), longer accretive sentences during reflection ("For decades, the island caretaker had observed..."). Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, and stakes simultaneously (e.g., "The oaks, sensing the change, stopped thickening their roots to crack the stone and instead reached their branches upward, fueled by the temple's own power"). Minor deduction: "weeks bled into months" is a slight cliché, and one instance of template cadence in paragraph four ("He began... Then, he drove... Silas moved..."). No paraphrase loops, clear propulsion, and the final image recharges prior motifs (pulse, warmth, interspecies respect) without summation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong imagery ("bruised purple sky," "bronze quiet," "suspended flight") and varied syntax. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor loop: "ancient basalt" / "ancient, trapped fly" / "metallic silence that felt ancient" recurs without escalating meaning. One scaffold phrase: "she was not here to worship; she was here to understand" restates the opening's skeptic stance without new pressure. The final line's "war song" charges the closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and sensory detail is vivid and selective ("salt-bleached timber," "phosphorescent buds," "oily water"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or ritual. However, several prose artifacts accumulate: near-paraphrase in "He closed his eyes, tuning out the lap of the waves to focus on the erratic screeching" followed immediately by "To a common ear, the sounds were merely hungry cries"; template-cadence runs in paragraph openings ("He waited," "He opened," "He cast"); and stock phrasing ("the promise of returning breath," "the inevitable victory of the roots") in the final paragraph. These patterns dull momentum without obscuring closure, but they prevent entry into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is rhythmic and clear with strong sentence variety. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, figurative language density in the opening ("wind prowling," "metallic beast," "bloodhound," "copper tang") clusters without clear payoff, risking overwriting (−0.4). A few near-paraphrases: "cryptic words echoing" restates the riddle's impact already shown. One filter-verb cluster ("he had honed," "he held up," "he traced") in the decoding sequence slightly dulls immediacy. Minor template cadence in the reflection on the leaf ("preserved memory," "hermetically sealed") but does not obscure causality. No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is textured and propulsive with strong rhythm control: "temporally stretched into infinite, luminous ribbons," "the heartbeat of a colossal, sleeping beast." Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances stakes or setting. Minor deductions: "She realized" appears twice near the pivot, creating mild scaffold; "a shift occurred in her chest, a hardening of resolve" tells rather than shows at a crucial beat. The phrase "the chaotic swirl of the accretion disk, her hand mimicking the distortion" repeats the chaos motif without fresh angle. Paragraph structure varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops mar the final third. Opening and closing images charge effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Syntax varies and rhythm supports the ritual escalation. Information density is high in the chess-swap sequence. However, the piece carries several loops and near-paraphrases: "the mechanism of the world's stasis" is restated in multiple ways; "wrongness" appears three times in similar constructions; "the unknown" is cycled through synonym variants ("chaos," "incomprehensible," "void"). The oxymoron density ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful," "terrifying, wondrous") clusters without pattern payoff and edges toward purple in peak beats. Stock metaphor: "thunderclap trapped in a bottle." These artifacts dull momentum and prevent entry to high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances concept, character, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (the chessboard as "perfect diagram," dust motes as ephemeral archive) serves pressure. No loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "luminous absence, where the missing pieces of the world seemed to glow brighter" stacks metaphor on metaphor in adjacent clauses, risking coherence without breaking it. The final paragraph's clarity ("memorial made of nothing but space") rescues any earlier density. Propulsion is strong through the Penumbra's movement and the sonic crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several prose artifacts cluster in pivotal beats. The opening paragraph uses "not made of…but of" construction followed immediately by "not a destination…but a living thing," creating template cadence. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "petrified folios," "canyons of prose," "stitching…stories into…reality," "water for this new growth" in quick succession at closure. Minor paraphrase loop: "she had forgotten what it felt like to belong" restates the prior sentence's claim about severing from truth. The phrase "rottting paper" / "dark debris" synonym pair and "ledge of crumbling scrolls" echo earlier "dust-choked labyrinthine" in texture without advancing the image. These issues touch the closure third, preventing 9+ eligibility globally and lowering line-level score by −1.0 cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong verbs ("teased loose," "winnow," "plucked"). Two patterns lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loop in paragraph three ("the phenomenon was known... as the woven hush, a silence so dense..." then "It was a barrier that preserved..."), restating the stasis concept; (2) template cadence in the resolution paragraph with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openers ("The resistance snapped. A ripple distorted... The solid smoke... The water droplet..."). These occur in the closure beat, triggering the artifact-at-closure deduction. Information density is high; sensory details (ozone, rough wool, plucked-string vibration) avoid generic placeholders. No grammar or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but controlled—"forged hush, hammered into place," "ossuary amphitheater," "prism of his art." Two adjacent sentences near the start paraphrase the canyon's acoustic threat without added pressure (−0.2). "Syncopated cadence," "multiphasic truth," and "many-colored as the light through a prism" cluster elevated diction in peak beats, edging toward overwriting but remaining coherent. Information density is strong; no loops or scaffolding in closure. Sentence openings vary. Minor template cadence in exposition ("This was...," "He did not...") does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty ("Green vapor curled around her ankles, signaling the final, fatal breach"), but several artifacts cluster in peak beats: paraphrase loop ("conjure meaning…snatching significance"), template cadence ("She snatched…In her other hand, she gripped"), and stock metaphor strings ("jaws of absolute erasure," "churning green dark"). The phrase "quilts memories together, stitching the sensory details of the past into a cohesive fabric" is explanation-heavy scaffolding that could compress. Filter verbs ("she began to narrate," "she saw the gears") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Clarity remains high, and the final image is clean, so closure is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most sentences doing double work. Opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor scaffold appears: "He stood up, securing his easel not for work, but for transport" could be tighter. The phrase "chimneylike fissure" and "holographic union of the past and the present" elevate diction slightly above the established register in peak beats. "Hours passed, or perhaps only minutes" is a small time-blur cliché. Figurative language is dense ("damp throat," "dying beam," "colors sang") but mostly coherent. One paraphrase loop: "immortalizing a moment" / "crafting a temporary eternity" restate the same concept across adjacent sentences. No severe artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, with longer contemplative beats contrasting shorter action moments. Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. Two minor issues: "a man who worshipped the authority of loud noises and rigid protocols" is tell-heavy where a concrete behavior would be sharper, and "the impossible scent of a garden at night spilled out" + immediate catalog risks slight overwriting. The figurative language in "bruised cobalt" and "agonizing care...like a physical wound" is coherent and voice-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stake. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, though some figurative density in early paragraphs ("bruised ocean," "swollen eye," "crushing friction") stacks without always adding pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity remains strong. The bronze foot's heating, the manual crank fight, and the signal tapering are concretely rendered. Final image is clean. Overwriting in the opening third (multiple metaphors per sentence without pattern-taught payoff) and occasional elevated diction ("cryptic phone calls" restated as "midnight instructions") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong imagery ("scar in the earth," "milky violet iris," "ambient scream of the squirrels"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the ritual and breathing in the final reflective beat. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Two frictions lower the score: "secondary, cruel attribute" is slightly clinical for the focalizer's voice, and "profound sense of victory" tells the emotion that the whispered lie already shows. The final metaphor—"sweetest truffle he had ever found"—closes the loop cleanly. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is often vivid ("solidified iridescent light," "oxidized copper and clockwork gears"). However, multiple lines lean on stock constructions: "trembling, ink-stained fingers," "swirling vapor," "burning motivation," "solemn, eccentric grace." Template cadence appears in the middle third ("He picked it up," "He sat," "He chose," "He concentrated," "He pulled"). Paraphrase loops are minimal, but figurative density in non-peak beats ("grey entropy of the mist," "ocean of time") slightly slows momentum. Information density is generally high; clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance stakes or setting. However, minor scaffold appears: "He was a lonely antique map dealer, a man who spent decades charting vanished empires while his own life shrank to a single, empty apartment" uses paraphrase structure (two clauses restating isolation). "The glimmer grew in intensity, pulsing in time with Elias's frantic heartbeat" stacks modifiers without adding precision. The closure beat is clean, but earlier texture occasionally favors elevated register over urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and controlled with strong figurative language ("sky weeping viscous light," "daggers of light," "ribcage of blue ice"). Information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs. Minor issues: "lacy menace" (opening) and "lace-like patterns of nothingness" echo without progression; "the mystery solved" is slightly scaffolding; "spotting the first fireflies of summer" as a Method appears only once in the closure beat without prior setup or dramatized mechanics, reading somewhat ornamental. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs, but elevated register persists uniformly under stress without vocal modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and many sentences do double duty: "It was then that Kaelen arrived, stepping out of the shadows with the quiet grace of someone who knew he was late but also knew he was essential" advances character, tone, and timing in one move. However, several lines veer into overwriting: "the science of the magic was complete, but the romance of the moment lingered, echoing in the spiral of the shell and the silence between them" restates what the prior image already conveyed. Minor filter-verb stacks ("He needed to revalue," "He believed that if you could balance") and a few abstract summaries ("the frequency of departure and the intimacy of the trust") reduce immediacy in peak beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and technical vocabulary is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (each line advances state or image). Figurative language is concentrated but coherent: "wolfish teeth," "hook," "liquid starlight." Minor scaffold appears: "The wind howled" / "The wind rushes" is near-paraphrase, and "chronologically confused, unmoored in a timeline" loops the concept. These slips are brief and don't obscure closure, capping upward movement but leaving the category solid.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("fog pressed against the single pane," "water counting down seconds"). However, several lines carry overwriting: "emotional terrain... landscape of feelings he can no longer scent on the breeze" is near-paraphrase within one sentence; "violent, beautiful past" stacks modifiers without adding pressure; "hypnotic grace" and "damp moment of repair" drift toward stock poetic diction. The final paragraph's "inhaled the damp silence, satisfied" completes the arc but the phrasing "healed something broken without ever needing to smell the rot" over-explains what the image already conveys. Template stems ("He watched... He knew... He reached") recur in the second paragraph. These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality at closure, so penalty remains in Q7 and is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance setting, trait, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the crystallization sequence and breathing during the held-breath ritual. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but coherent: "bruised sky," "warm velvet," "virulent violet light." Minor deduction: "the frantic thud of her heartbeat dared to sound" and "the fierce, irrational belief of childhood" are near-stock phrases in peak beats. Filter-verb use ("she realized," "she understood") appears but remains voice-motivated and does not stack. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm: short beats during the manifestation ("The ghost flickered violently") accelerate, longer paragraphs during setup establish mood. Minor loop: "the first tree screaming as it fell" echoes the father's "silent scream," which may be intentional motif or inadvertent churn. Some figurative density in the opening ("lignin and neglect," "temporal pause where...static") risks overwriting but stays legible. The phrase "grief is like water trapped in a blocked pipe" borders on over-explicit metaphor. Information density is high—every line advances ritual or stakes—with no scaffolding. Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence. One paraphrase slip: "the silence outside shattered. The roar of chainsaws erupted" restates the same beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    Syntax varies purposefully, and sentence rhythm accelerates during the arbitration confrontation, but several lines loop or scaffold: "the architecture was constructed from petrified moments and forgotten eras" restates the opening's "impossible geometry...lost in time" without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("the air shimmered," "the Spiral Arbitration demanded," "the Spiral Arbitration shuddered") that flatten propulsion. Figurative language is dense—"violent temporal spasm," "kaleidoscopic sky," "centrifugal force"—and occasionally mixed (stars as flowers, logic as gears), reducing clarity in peak beats. No major grammatical errors, but information density suffers from conceptual repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: "the screaming friction of raw chronology grinding against itself" carries metaphysical weight without purple excess. Rhythm varies—long sentences during setup compress to fragments under crisis. Information density is high: nearly every line advances character obsession, world logic, or pressure. Minor artifacts: "It was an eminently peculiar gesture" is scaffolding exposition; "As a hydraulic clock shepherd, Kaelen was accustomed to" front-loads profession awkwardly. The backward-count interludes risk template cadence but serve trance-state voice, so the effect reads purposeful. One paraphrase slip: "razor edges" and "infinitely thin panes" restate the same image across adjacent beats without added texture. No loops in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; information density is high (lantern, equations, father contrast layered efficiently). Clarity holds throughout. Template cadence issue: multiple "She [verb]" stems in the final third ("She stopped," "She had traversed," "She realized") create minor repetition. "A profound sense of peace" and "sad, sweet perfection" are stock phrases that dull the closure beat slightly. These artifacts prevent 8+ but do not obscure causality. No loops or paraphrase cycles elsewhere; propulsion remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "resting on his makeshift switchboard was a pristine glass harmonica disc, scavenged from an antique shop that had burned down in the twenties" layers object, history, and world texture). Rhythm varies purposefully. One paraphrase loop: "This was necessary because…" and "This was the delicate art…" open adjacent paragraphs with similar declarative stems (−0.2). One minor register drift: "cultivated estrangement" is academic in a beat otherwise grounded in tactile action (−0.1). No loops touch closure. Propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, setting, or interiority. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("bruised into true night," "vibrated in the wooden planks") stays coherent. Minor deductions for a paraphrase loop ("It was a joy so intense it felt like a ghost…" followed by "shivering with a delight that was no longer strictly alive") and the filter-verb stack in paragraph three ("watched," "felt"). No major artifacts touch closure, keeping the piece in the strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-rich with strong concision. "Invoices never asked him why he was crying," "ivy...held up the crumbling Victorian brickwork better than the original mortar," and "clattered indistinguishably among the earthly gravel" demonstrate high craft. Information density is excellent. Deductions: "This was the specific timeframe when the story changes" is scaffold meta-commentary that should be cut. "The polite anarchy of the world continued outside, chaotic and absurd, but inside the station, the logic of the heart had finally taken over" leans slightly purple and abstract at the closure beat, reducing punch. One paraphrase loop: "catalyst" appears twice in close proximity (paragraph 6 and final paragraph). These keep the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong sensory specifics and varied sentence structure. However, several lines carry overwriting that slows momentum: "frantic syntax of a million screaming leaves," "dense, tactile novel of ancient vibrations," "quiet blaze that was less about fire and more about an intense, burning silence" stack metaphor without adding causal clarity. "Possessed of a quiet blaze" is strained phrasing. Some scaffold remains: "She was a blind mapmaker, a cartographer not of land and sea, but of..." paraphrases within the same beat. The opening and closing images are strong, and information density is generally high, but the figurative density in the first third applies a −0.5 deduction for overwriting that slightly dulls immediacy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but coherent (DNA helices, threshing, spear point, purring cat). However, overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: "sweet, heavy pressure," "fluttering their pages in a wind," "shimmered like vellum," and "ambient distortion into the narrative structure of the cosmos" stack metaphors without earned pattern. Minor paraphrase loop: "he was editing the causal chain" followed by "forcing the universe to reinterpret" restates the same action. No template cadence or loops at closure, so accumulation cap applies: −0.8 for density and coherence issues in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates across beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "joyful sorrow" / "poignant happiness," "no one remembers you" restated as "history had evaporated," and the closure's "captured nothing" / "changed everything" / "song…would last forever" recycle the same claim across three lines. Figurative language is dense but sometimes muddled—"thick enough to swallow a name" mixes metaphors (fog doesn't ingest abstract nouns), and "mapping silence" as geometric arcs is asserted rather than concretely rendered. The final paragraph stacks three synonym phrases for the same idea (camera captured nothing, observation changed everything, song lasts forever), flattening propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the descent sequence. Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or recontextualization. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She loved this dead world with a ferocity that could burn cities, just as she had loved Kael" restates the volcanic tenderness already established; "The hidden message revealed itself" + "Kael had not been hiding his face; he had been showing her" recycles the same realization. The final paragraph contains three consecutive summary sentences ("The message was received, and the promise was kept" after the image has already landed) that reduce momentum. Template cadence in the middle third ("She stopped... She climbed... She ran... She descended... She approached... She picked up...") stacks subject-verb openers without variation. Apply −0.6 for loops and −0.4 for template cadence, totaling −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance world-building, character, or pressure. Rhythm varies appropriately, accelerating during the drumming sequence. Clarity is strong except for one adjacency issue: "A pervasive tone of auroral sorrow washed over him, a beautiful, grief-stricken light" mixes metaphor vehicles (tone/light) in a way that momentarily blurs the image. A few filter verbs ("feeling the vibrations," "He felt the pull") are acceptable but cluster slightly. The final image is vivid and propulsive. No loops or scaffold, though "the echo of his own pulse" and "vibration of their combined existence" approach synonym territory without crossing into redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or over-explain: "checking his GPS, which spun wildly due to the magnetic interference of the storm" restates what the reader already infers from context, and "The smuggler's voice cracked under the strain of his volume, barely audible over the rising wind" competes with itself (cracked/barely audible). The metaphor "architectural folds" in the final line is vivid but edges toward purple in a beat that would benefit from concrete action. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of small redundancies and elevated diction in peak moments prevents entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift from subject-verb to participial and prepositional phrases. Information density is high in the lantern-manipulation sequence. Three artifact clusters lower the score: elevated diction ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "tapestry of luminescence") stacks without pattern-teaching in a brief window; the phrase "a core concept of silent empathy" is abstract meta-commentary; and "the crushing weight of her guilt" + "her internal abyss" paraphrase the same state across adjacent beats. Template cadence appears in "He knew... so he turned... He began..." Minor clarity slip: "within the edge of a half-spoken secret" as timeframe remains vague throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and momentum mostly propels, but several lines carry figurative weight that slows rather than sharpens ("blue bruise," "dust-moted skylight funneled the cosmos," "hush where past meets prophecy," "amplified quiet…atmosphere before a lightning strike"). Template cadence appears in the city-reveal beat: "Pedestrians…faltered" / "Elias heard the change" / "The seamless flow…snagged"—three consecutive expository declarations. Two paraphrase loops: the "electric thrill of a secret kept in common" (paragraph 6) is re-stated as children's thoughts "quieted into their own distinct voices" (paragraph 10); "stop and solve it" (paragraph 17) echoes "stop and think" (final line). Metaphor coherence holds but density in mid-story beats risks ornament over propulsion. No severe artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and propulsive, with high information density ("vanishing coastline," "twilight zone where the tide never truly receded"). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (violence as "punching through thick gelatin," ocean as "crushing, loving pressure"). Minor overwriting in the opening ("a civilized world where a clenched fist met only soft resistance") slightly abstracts the violence-pacification concept. The final image ("kicking their legs with newfound power") is concrete and charges prior material. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, character state, theme). Minor overwriting: "shattered the oppressive atmosphere with a booming, theatrical voice, dramatically narrating" stacks modifiers in one beat. The phrase "cultivate lightness in grief" borders on elevated diction but remains within the dystopian frame. Final line ("safe, alone, and completely empty") resolves cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (shadows "like spilled ink," "affectionate cats"), but several lines paraphrase the same transformation without added detail: "dissolving boundaries," "distinction... began to blur," "she could no longer tell where her skin ended," "the separation had never been real." Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the meditative mood. However, the repeated restatement of boundary-dissolution across adjacent beats constitutes a paraphrase loop (−0.2), and the abstraction ("raw language of the atmosphere," "lethal voltage of the source") occasionally sacrifices concrete clarity for poetic elevation. The closure beat is vivid but the density of figurative language in the middle third verges on overwriting without pattern-payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety is strong ("The Great Fire had bleached..." vs. "She blew hard."), and information density is high—nearly every line advances setting, character, or plot. The opening paragraph's syntactic richness ("stripping away the lies of color") contrasts purposefully with the climax's staccato urgency. Minor deductions: "a giant of a man whose skin was scarred like old parchment" is stock phrasing, and "fancied himself a gardener of souls" leans slightly purple without full payoff. The "museum-tour" effect in paragraph two (Phoenix, Somnambulists, trade mechanics) slows momentum briefly but recovers by paragraph three's concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and rhythm are strong overall, but several lines carry slight overwriting: "vast, vaulted chamber," "deep, golden shadows," "heavy, rumbling embrace" lean on paired modifiers. The phrase "the sensation that was powerfully gentle" directly echoes the required attribute, reading slightly template-planted rather than organic. No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative density in the opening third ("flickering chaos," "sanctuary for the obsolete," "hollow ache") slightly slows momentum. Propulsion recovers at the turn and sustains through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance craft, character, or atmosphere. The brass press "hummed with a low, thrumming vibration" and the "holographic phantom of the lilies" are vivid, specific images. However, several paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "He had retreated...after hitting rock bottom, a collapse so total that the world below had ceased to hold any gravity" restates the same concept across two clauses; "Days or perhaps merely hours later—time was fluid here—the heavy iron door creaked open" uses meta-commentary to skip transition work. The phrase "a lie made of truth, a pristine construct built from messy ruin" stacks near-synonymous clauses. Rhythm varies well in the final beat, but earlier passages lean on longer periodic sentences without sufficient syntactic contrast. Applying patterned-artifact baseline: −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well; opening establishes atmosphere before tightening to action. Information density is high in the middle section (card-drawing, measuring, triangulation). However, several lines loop concepts: "He was not merely a fortune teller" restates what the prior paragraph showed; "the horror of the implication sinking in" tells what the next paragraph will explain. "Steadily curious" appears twice as identical phrase. The measuring-tape description at first appearance is clean, but "the sense of inherited mystery finally unraveling" states rather than trusts the image. Minor register drift: "fractious history" feels elevated for crisis thought. Propulsion is strong in the measurement sequence but slackens when explaining the conspiracy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops appear: "steadily unpredictable" and "landscape that morphed responsively" restate the same idea; "stripped the sticky emotional residue" and "purify the space around her" overlap without added pressure. Template cadence in the dance sequence: "She lurched forward three steps, spun counter-clockwise, crouched in silence for a count of four, and then vaulted sideways" is a list that stalls momentum rather than propelling it. Stock metaphors cluster in the final third: "burned away the last vestiges," "cold, sharp, and resolved," "light in the dark, a terrible, beautiful beacon." The closure beat—"leaving her innocence behind in the dust"—is a familiar metaphor that does not recharge prior particulars. Applying −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, and −0.4 for stock metaphors in the final third per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or concept without padding. Sentence rhythm varies ("He stopped before his workbench" / "The discrepancy confirmed Elian's theory" / "Then, the impossible began to happen"), and the metamorphosis beat propels without loops. Figurative language is vivid but mostly purposeful ("tangled, verdant vines of narrative possibility," "smoke," "gravitational pull"). Minor penalties: "forensic archaeology of the soul" and "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" edge toward elevated abstraction without full embodiment in action; "luminous regret" in the final line risks stock pairing. One paraphrase slip: "The shadow unbound rippled" followed immediately by "It swirled" restates motion without added detail. No major artifact or template cadence runs, but the cumulative decorative density in the opening third slightly softens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer reflective passages), information density is high, and clarity holds through surgical sequence. However, "the beat of a heart or the rustle of scales," "a galaxy of dust motes," "sympathetic shedding within her own psyche," and "silver grace" stack figurative language in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching, triggering ~−0.4 for density. "The atmosphere held a shimmering stillness" and later "the heavy silence" risk gentle redundancy. No loops or scaffold; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong figurative control: "chemical fog of the anesthesia," "jagged, circular map," "glowing nerve of the tower." Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph structure creates visual momentum. However, several filter-verb clusters ("felt the thrum," "feeling the thrum," "stared intently") and minor paraphrase loops ("the answer lay not...but beneath" / "to find the source") slightly dull immediacy. "Explicitly fusing" appears to be a typo for "inextricably." The final beat is clean and charged. Information density is high throughout; no major scaffold or loops beyond the noted slips.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and image-rich with strong propulsion through the ritual. However, overwriting and figurative saturation in high-pressure beats reduce clarity: "cramped geometry...unfolded and reorganized," "invisible weight of unsaid things, building pillars of regret," "nebula swirled, glowing with...amber light" stack metaphors without allowing the reader to breathe. The opening sentence runs long with nested clauses ("a sanctuary perched high...the empty auditorium") and some phrasing verges on purple ("forgotten lyrics search for tune in the whistling drafts"). Template stems appear ("She could feel...She focused...She guided") and a few filter verbs dull immediacy. No paraphrase loops or major syntax errors, but the density occasionally obscures rather than sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity holds; no pronoun confusion or timeline breaks. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("electric violets," "remembered stardust," "celestial downpour") enriches texture. However, paraphrase loops appear: "unspoken words" recurs across three beats with near-identical phrasing; "frantic, desperate speed" in one line, "gasping, his chest heaving" two lines later both summarize rather than enact. The closure beat—"stopped fighting," "stopped trying," "simply lay still"—uses template stems that dull propulsion. Apply −0.6 for scaffold accumulation touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("silica petals that chimed like broken glass," "wave functions...singing a low, thrumming resonance"), and while vivid, the metaphoric load in nearly every sentence risks overwriting during peak beats (the dispersion paragraph). Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines ("He was the sand...he was the clock...he was the guard") as intentional parallelism, not loop, but the effect flattens propulsion slightly. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports the ritual cadence. No grammar or continuity breaks; clarity holds despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the turbine sequence. However, line-level artifacts appear: "The atmosphere shifted, heavy with the tone of probable miracles" is abstract and register-drifts; "It was the distinct feeling that the impossible was merely a matter of finding the correct leverage point" summarizes rather than enacts; "The unravelling of the mechanism mirrored the unravelling of his own psyche" is a paraphrase loop that dulls the closure beat. The phrase "solidified idea, a physical manifestation of a solution" restates the same content. These scaffolding moments and thematic summary in peak beats trigger cumulative deductions. No other major slips; opening and mid-story clarity are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or restate without added pressure: "He was one of the wise ferry guides, a custodian of the liminal spaces" restates her role; "the snapped tether, the psychic bond" is synonym pairing. Figurative language ("terrible, ringing silence," "oceanic embrace," "rhythmic calm") clusters densely in the final third without clear escalation in meaning. The closure beat itself is clean—"a weight that felt like his own resolved will"—but the preceding lines mix metaphors (waves washing away panic, mist becoming solid) without tight coherence. No major scaffolding, but moderate overwriting in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. Figurative language ("drink the warmth," "molten glass," "noose") is vivid but concentrated in the opening and discovery beats; the final paragraph's density (weaponized silence, frostbitten hope, blue dark) risks slight overwriting without obscuring clarity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor: "unpardonable silence" appears twice as a phrase, the second time as direct statement rather than image, costing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("dust-choked," "golden haze," "biting iron gall ink"). Two issues accumulate: "gravitational density of a collapsed star" and "cosmic pressure into a shape" in the opening feel like stacked scientific metaphors that blur more than clarify Orel's nature. Paraphrase loop: "a deep, resonant crack began to sunder the floor" followed by "This was not a destruction of matter, but a severance of connection" restates the concept without added pressure. Grammar is clean, no pronoun drift. High information density elsewhere keeps this in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at discovery: "The path hadn't disappeared because of erosion or burial; it had disappeared because it had been consumed"). Information density is high; most lines advance situation or character understanding. Minor loop: "the fossil fuel ban" appears twice in close proximity without variation. The phrase "a way to feel the vibrations" and later "feel the vibrations of the deep" recycles construction. Figurative language ("rogue wave," "skeletal remains stretching endlessly") remains coherent and voice-appropriate. Opening and closing lines effectively frame the revelation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is strong throughout, with high information density in the opening and ritual beats. Some minor scaffold: "a title she bore with a mixture of pride and resignation" is tell-heavy; "The silence in the bay was profound, broken only by…" is a stock construction. Mild figurative density in the opening paragraph (three metaphors in quick succession: "jagged slice," "copper tang," "barefoot stargazer") without pattern-teaching, but it doesn't obscure the scene. "Thunderous serenity" as the climax descriptor is oxymoronic by design and fits the tone, though "not quite sound and not quite silence" adds a redundant gloss. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure image, keeping the score above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several scaffolding phrases dull momentum: "It was the vessel of an implanted destiny" and "It was a method of transmission" are expository restatements. The metaphor "curled around Elara's ankles like a living shackle" is vivid but borders on purple when stacked with "the earth was still angry." "Kaleidoscope irises" and "weaponized hope" feel like coined phrases rather than earned images. No major loops, but minor redundancy (moss "screamed" then "shrieked") and elevated diction in peak beats (decoding, unsealing) create slight drag.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. The opening image of glass walls as "fragile lung of greenery" and the graft as literal and thematic closure demonstrate strong figurative control. Minor template cadence in the second paragraph ("He was the drone strike wedding survivor… He was quietly talented… To him, plants were…") and slight overwriting in "singularity of violence" and "visceral memory" introduce brief friction. The phrase "somatic markers" and "pearl of stillness" border on therapy-speak but are quickly embodied through tactile action (touching the photo, wrapping the graft). No paraphrase loops; sentence variety supports rhythm and the final line propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "horizon shatter like a dropped mirror," "palette of grief," "strings of reality," "chute." Some metaphors risk incoherence under scrutiny ("knotted" reality, "weft of the library"), and the final third sustains elevated register without relief, flirting with overwriting. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction for cumulative metaphor load that occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion, especially in the middle paragraph describing the light and the box's symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing lines anchor stakes. Two paraphrase loops: "He needed to understand the mechanics... not for philosophy, but for dominance" restates the hunt's singular motivation unnecessarily; "The scholar tipped the vial... splash onto the flat stone" is redundant with the subsequent description of the liquid's landing. Stock metaphor: "wind howled like a dying god" lacks fresh specificity. Filter-verb stack: "He watched, mesmerized" + "stood alone" + "looked up" clusters passive observation in the closure third. These artifacts dull momentum but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts reduce clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "silence...not merely an absence of sound, but a physical weight" is restated as "dizzying quiet that pressed against the temples"; "to simply publish...would be...futility" is immediately followed by "Instead, she had physically spliced." Template stems recur: "She wanted them to ask why...and why." Overwriting is present in high-pressure beats: "the magnitude of the breach," "suspended moment, a fracture in time where the future hung delicately." Stock metaphors ("strip away the myth," "behind the curtain") dull specificity. These issues cluster but do not obscure the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but overwriting clusters in key beats. "Senselessly perceptive" contradicts itself; "engraved quiet…physically carved" is mixed metaphor; "radiant orange-red that burned without consuming…tranquil blaze" stacks contradictory images without clarifying the effect. The phrase "phantom inheritance that urged violence" and "density of the peace she cultivated" rely on abstraction where concrete action would sharpen. Paraphrase appears: the opening "fragile membrane" and later "vacuum of authority" both describe loss without added pressure. These artifacts appear in non-closure beats, applying −0.6 within Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent ("teeth hidden in velvet," "streak of pure, blinding silence"). Sentence rhythm varies and propels without loops. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "resinous heavy frequencies," "oscillating canopy," "feral lullaby that begged the listener to close their eyes and die," "streak of pure, blinding silence cutting through the cacophony"—four metaphoric/elevated constructions in quick succession risk density fatigue. "Transliterated air" recurs without enough variance. The spike's flight—"gravitational thud, dragging the filament"—is vivid, but "scream of silence collided with the divine echo, creating a vacuum" mixes metaphors (silence screams? collision creates vacuum?). Deduction for figurative density and minor coherence slip in the climax; no loops or scaffold, so penalty remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled with strong image work: "tearing paper" voice, "indigo ink dry," "mist in the morning sun." Sentence structure varies, and information density is high. Minor issues: "Being a woman devotedly observant" is an awkward participial construction; "smelled faintly of cedar and old iron" stacks modifiers without strong necessity; "the two actions were mutually exclusive" over-explains the contradiction already shown. The final paragraph loops slightly ("quiet once more" echoes the opening sanctuary motif without adding pressure). No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "rough, unpolished piece of amber" grounds setting, stakes, and machine logic). Two minor loops: "designed to interpret...now specifically translates" feels like a restatement across adjacent beats, and "shifted from oppressive to peaceful" slightly summarizes what the prior line already showed. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed register: "lines of code that wept and stuttered" anthropomorphizes code but is then immediately literalized by "visual representation of a wail," creating mild incoherence. No fatal artifacts, but the density slips slightly in the expository middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is generally high and propulsion clear, but figurative language clusters in the opening without pattern payoff: "bruised and tender lilac," "dissolving like sugar in hot tea," "suffocating quilt" within two sentences. Template-cadence risk in the second paragraph ("The sound was not merely noise; it was..."). Minor paraphrase loop: "voices were arguing, talking over one another" restates the same chaos. The climax beat is clean and the final image sharp, limiting penalty scope, but the opening overwriting and scattered loops prevent higher placement.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. Several passages carry figurative density that slows propulsion: "void to bleed through in streaks," "prismatic reflections that mocked the darkness," "fragile deception, a lie woven from stone and code" (−0.5 for density in non-lyric mode). Paraphrase loop: "hope rather than desperation" echoes prior emotional summary without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening (multiple "where" and "the" stems) and some filter-verb stacks ("looking," "watching") dull immediacy (−0.3). No loops touch closure. Propulsion weakens in the middle third with reflection on ghost algorithms and past markets.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.6)
    Information density is high and propulsion steady, but several lines loop or rephrase: "sweet, golden flavor of applause" / "triumph worthy of a standing ovation" restate Barnaby's craving; "glitching seasons of the apple trees" is smoothed then immediately called "perpetual, blossoming spring." Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He focused… He guided… He took… Barnaby worked feverishly… Barnaby felt." Figurative language is dense (violet streaks, grey static, B-flat major hum, velvet sensation) withoutmuddling, but the accumulation in consecutive sentences slightly slows momentum before the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high: most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in the final paragraph: "brittle, translucent, and incredibly precious" stacks modifiers where one stronger choice would suffice, and "willowglass hope" leans decorative. The geode's "ghosting echo of rainbows" is vivid but borders purple. Clarity and propulsion remain intact; the slips do not touch the closure beat's core mechanics (the lattice image).

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is generally high, and technical detail is integrated into action. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "no longer just a guardian...the interpreter of the waking" restates "guardian of the sleep" without added pressure; "she was no longer X; she was Y" is a template closure move. The fossil's function is told twice in adjacent beats ("psychological bridge" / "carry her through") without dramatized micro-choice. A few stock metaphors ("throat of the cave") and elevated register ("crushing isolation," "fluid chaos") in peak moments create minor distance from embodied immediacy. No major artifacts obscure causality, but accumulated scaffold and minor redundancy lower momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the button-cataloging sequence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs are evident. Clarity is strong throughout, and the opening/closing lines frame the arc effectively. Two minor issues: "The process was slow, but the core concept of shared wisdom began to manifest" is scaffolding that tells rather than shows, and "discordant shrieking softened" relies on a generic verb. The figurative language ("tangled knot of fears") is functional but not charged. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("jagged wound in the sky," "breath plumes like smoke from a dying fire," "predatory insect") with mixed coherence (a bluff as a wound in the sky is physically unclear). Template cadence appears in exposition ("It was that precise, aching moment…") and paraphrase loops recur ("fixing what's broken, be it a shattered hinge or a fractured loyalty" echoes the core concept without added pressure). The final beat carries thematic weight but leans toward tell. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, others scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythm varies, but density of figurative language—"knot of anxiety," "thick scarred document," "murky suspension," "spindrift serenity"—approaches overwriting in a single continuous beat without pattern-teaching or payoff that reweights cost. Mixed metaphor tension: "percolate" (liquid through grounds) and "drip away... filtering down into mud" work together, but "scraped clean one last time to reveal underlying parchment" shifts vehicle mid-image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Sentence openings vary. Minor deduction for elevated diction ("palimpsest," "ambient awareness") that, while consistent, risks distancing the reader from immediate sensory pressure. Information density is high; momentum is steady but not propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting: "a sound that was less a noise and more of a physical sensation" could be tighter; "perilous elegance" in "thinning to a perilous elegance" feels slightly ornamental. Figurative language is dense but purposeful in most beats. The "as chimney smoke flattens" simile is fresh and functional. Closure image (the pot drying, the vision fading) is clean and propulsive. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn detected.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "the water slick with an oily, iridescent sheen that mimicked the stars" gives sensory detail and mood). Clarity is strong in spatial choreography and action sequence. Minor scaffold: "It was only *after the final petal drops from the old rosebush* that he allowed himself to move" reads slightly template-constructed with the italicized phrase. The phrase "a *quivering hush* fell over the scene" is vivid but the "physical sensation of vibrating stillness that seemed to suspend the very air particles in place" over-explains the metaphor in the next sentence. "Swallowed by the gloom of the architecture" is fresh, but "As the mirrors caught the uprising glow" uses "uprising" in a strained way. No major loops or muddles; propulsion is steady. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; the "synthetic flower" metaphor for the mirror array works.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high, and propulsion is maintained through the ritual sequence. Minor overwriting: "fluid, chaotic recollections," "vast and empty," and "endless volumes of the sky" stack modifiers without sharpening sense. Figurative language appears frequently ("shell of her present self," "graveyard for the Sun-Drinkers," "ocean that left the peak in brilliant, blinding sunlight") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. One scaffold moment: "The goal was not to forget… The goal was to coexist" repeats the stem without added pressure, costing ~−0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual texture. Information density is high—most lines layer image, mood, and thematic charge. Minor overwriting: "heaviness that felt less like an absence of noise and more like a physical weight of peace" paraphrases itself; "prismatic quiet" recurs three times, verging on ornamental in one instance. Figurative language (bruising sky, waking flower, warm quilt) is dense but mostly coherent. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Figurative language ("engine of complex power plays," "strings cut by a localized burst of low-end audio") is dense in exposition beats but avoids muddle in the peak technical sequence. Minor paraphrase loop: "cosmic tricksters" / "entities" / "tricksters" across adjacent paragraphs without pressure gain. Template cadence is minimal. Information density is high in the counter-frequency procedure; no loops or scaffold obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance situation, character state, or atmosphere without scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent ("suspended in amber," "dark altar," "breathing down on her like living predators"). Rhythm accelerates cleanly during the climax. Minor deductions: "the core concept of this place was not stability, but a volatile spatial mutiny" slightly over-explains where dramatization would suffice; the final paragraph's "the world felt different now—awake, alert, and waiting" edges toward summary of an effect already shown. No loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the artistic-process beats. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "He did not see a face…he saw topographic maps" is restated as "to him it was just a collection of shapes and values" in the penultimate paragraph. "The cold case was no longer just a stack of papers; it was a ghost demanding to be heard" adds metaphorical restatement without new pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "He approached…He worked…He needed…He picked up…He looked…He then took" in successive paragraphs. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong sensory specificity ("green-crusted copper nail," "water-warped pages"). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports beats. However, two adjacent lines loop the "spongey dread" concept: "The air inside…tasted of…a spongey dread" followed immediately by "Every surface was slick with condensation, effectively blurring the line…" restates atmosphere without new pressure. "Remarkably like bruised, swollen flesh" in a technical context feels register-strained. Template stems ("She + verb") recur in the ritual sequence without pattern-teaching. Apply paraphrase-loop and minor template penalties: −0.6 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences carry momentum and information density is generally high. However, several lines loop or restate: "The hitchhiker had not been a woman of flesh and blood, but a courier of this glitch" is followed by "delivering the tool he needed," which paraphrases the same idea. The metaphor "the world did not sharpen back into its cruel, high-contrast certainty; instead, it remained soft, forgiving, and open" is elegant but slightly over-explained by the prior "pixelated amnesty" exposition. Figurative language is dense in the climactic beats (shimmer, optical interference, bioluminescence) without always advancing new information, triggering minor overwriting deductions. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks are present.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do two jobs (e.g., "basking in a dusky harmony of rotting velvet and blue monitor light" combines setting and tone). No loops or paraphrase cycles. Weakness: "perceptively calm" in paragraph five and "polished calm" in paragraph three create near-synonym drift without added pressure. The phrase "desperate promise of forward momentum" in the currency paragraph edges toward abstraction. Closure image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is often vivid ("copper machinery silent," "basalt pillars," "glittering dust"). However, the piece carries several scaffold and paraphrase loops: "She was a lucid dream chronicler…capable of maintaining waking consciousness while navigating…" restates the role in exposition; "This object was the emotional coordinate she needed" tells what the prior paragraph showed; "She had witnessed the darkness, used the stars…and spoken the light into existence" recaps the climax in summary. Template cadence appears in the dream beats ("The inscriptions…were alive, writhing and shifting…waiting…"). Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments ("she believed," "she knew," "she felt"), dulling immediacy. The final paragraph's explanation dilutes closure impact. Information density is uneven; some lines do multiple jobs, others paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Overwriting is pervasive in high-pressure beats: "churning maw of impossibility," "branches interlocking like the fingers of drowning giants," "diamond shell," "wet snap," "arterial blood," "pythons"—figurative density appears in nearly every sentence without clear pattern-teaching or POV motivation, triggering the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "orchard vortex ground the sky into bruised pulp" strains coherence. Sentence openings show some variety but the ornate register throughout flattens momentum. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences carry high information density and momentum: "vegetation here had erupted in seconds rather than centuries, creating a thicket that smelled of ozone and ancient moss" does triple duty (world-building, sensory anchor, causal link to acceleration). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in "a vibration of anxious elation hummed beneath his skin, a jittery mixture of terror and ecstatic hope" (two adjacent phrases restating the same emotion) and "swirling vortex where the sleeping thoughts of the city met the verdant, aggressive intent of the new forests" (slightly elevated diction for peak urgency). Grammar and sequence are clean; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences propel with varied syntax and high information density; each line advances character, action, or world. Figurative language is purposeful ("silent sepulcher," "snare the fleeing fragments") and vivid without muddle. Minor elevation in diction ("trammel," "semiotics," "dusky resolve") at peak beats slightly inflates texture, though it remains legible and voice-consistent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and momentum are strong. The final image ("slumped against the bone-studded wall") lands cleanly without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most lines doing double work. Opening and closing images are strong. No paraphrase loops detected. Minor artifacts: "confidently uncertain" in paragraph 9 leans slightly toward oxymoron convenience, and "echo valley longing" in the penultimate paragraph feels somewhat imposed rather than fully earned through prior particulars. The technical recitations ("Tygan fret cloth," "Bleached warp, unbleached weft") serve character and momentum. Propulsion is consistent; no scaffolding or synonym churn. Small deduction for one moment of elevated diction ("tourniquet for his anxiety") that slightly breaks the otherwise grounded voice under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances Elian's grief-work or the station's crisis. Rhythm modulates well: longer sentences in reflective beats, shorter in the activation sequence. Minor overwriting in paragraph one: "the physics of transition that had whisked his partner away" could be tighter, and "haunted ambitions" + "ghost of a fear" stacks metaphoric language without full integration. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative coherence mostly holds, though "heavy and cold" seed then "dense gravity of information" risks mild redundancy. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clarity and rhythm are strong; sentence variety supports the accumulative design. Information density is high: nearly every line advances setting, character, or conflict. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor deductions: the phrase "specific wintersun serenity" and "crushing weight of history" border on stock metaphor, and "there was work to be done, and there was meaning to be made" in the final line uses parallel construction that edges toward summarizing theme rather than charging it through image. Overall propulsion is good, and the figurative language in the smelting beat is controlled and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and figurative language is vivid without overwhelming clarity ("the silence…filled with a resonant hush that pressed against his eardrums like deep, dark water"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor loop: "The silence of the cavern was not empty, but filled with a resonant hush" and later "In the resonant hush that followed" recycle the same image without adding pressure. A few filter verbs ("he realized," "he understood") cluster in the climax section, slightly dulling immediacy. The phrase "desperate for safety" (final paragraph context) is label-only when stronger embodiment would serve. No severe artifacts, but accumulation keeps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character and atmosphere. However, the final paragraph contains a paraphrase loop: "the graffiti had been right all along. The river had remembered, but it did not judge; it simply flowed" repeats the confirmation across adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.2). The phrase "the accordion bellows patched with tape" appears verbatim twice in close proximity, and "the water" recurs as subject in several adjacent sentences, creating mild template cadence (−0.4). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "crushing embrace of ivy" and "oracle he sought" work, though "the only vessel capable of singing his necessary apology" borders on mixed vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and no hard loops or scaffold appear. However, multiple adjacent sentences share template cadence: "She was known…" / "She was here…" / "She had to…" / "She felt…" / "She looked…" Figurative language in peak beats ("bruised purple," "chaotic dance of geometry," "intoxicating") is competent but leans decorative. "The air hummed with a low frequency vibration" and "the library protected its secrets" could be tightened. No artifact touches closure directly, so the −0.4 non-closure adjustment applies.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with good rhythm variation and strong imagery ("deafening roar of green ambition," "cascade of melting slush"). Information density is high; most sentences advance multiple elements. Two friction points lower the score: "He had to act now, in this fragile hour before the promise loses its glow" feels like slight overwriting with register drift, and "drawing upon the supernatural preservation magic" is tell-heavy scaffolding. The closure image is vivid and propulsive. No loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"dissolving into the ether," "unspooling," "visual snow of forgotten breakfasts"—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff; the ornate diction in peak beats ("the static in her mind crested into a wave of pure geometry") prioritizes texture over propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: "obsidian table" and "the vessel of Magister Vane" both anchor the same setup; "finding patterns in static" is elaborated twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Filter-verb stack in the opening paragraph ("was a natural cathedral," "was dissolving," "was a delicate balance") dulls immediacy. Information density is moderate; several lines describe rather than advance. Clarity remains intact, but momentum is softened by decorative layering.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action). However, several phrases border on overwriting in the reflective middle ("the cycle of rebirth was not a punishment, she mused, but a washing away of the accumulated grime of existence" reads slightly elevated for the moment). Minor paraphrase loop: "contentment was not a destination…yet elusive" is restated at closure with minimal added pressure. Figurative language is mostly controlled, but "bruised purple" and "unspun wool" in quick succession test density without full payoff. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Clarity and propulsion are mostly strong.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many sentences doing double work (e.g., "He was a conscience for hire..." establishes role and moral stance). However, several prose artifacts appear: paraphrase loops ("The sound was flat, ugly, and unyielding" followed by Elias's near-identical interpretation), elevated metaphor stacks in the opening ("monolith of conviction," "definition of sincerely insincere"), and template stems ("He was," "It was"). The mirror description—"two layers of ancient glass with a vacuum trapped between them"—halts momentum for exposition. The final paragraph's "warm embrace of uncertainty" and "mercy to take root" veer toward stock metaphor. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting total penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive with strong images: "rings of silver fire," "a sycamore hush, a dry and rustling peace," "the sensation of falling." However, several sentences carry overwriting or scaffold artifacts. "She weaves truth carefully, constructing a lesson that would bypass his logic and strike directly at his perception" paraphrases the prior sentence's concept. "The silence atop the floating rock meditation platform was not empty, but filled with a sycamore hush" uses a somewhat contradictory metaphor (silence filled with hush). The phrase "through the trance, Kael's vision began to blur and sharpen simultaneously" is vivid but the simultaneity construction appears again in "the boundaries of the world softening into a unified field." Filter verbs cluster in the trance sequence ("began to blur," "seemed to slow," "realized he was waiting") without clear voice motivation. The final paragraph's "She had successfully transmitted the legacy" is tell-summary that deflates the prior image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and the prose propels forward with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "coiled his body with the tension of a tightly wound spring," "rode the sound wave." Two mild artifacts: "He was no longer the old man standing in the dust; he was the sound itself" edges toward explicit telling of transformation, and repeated constructions like "He [verb]" appear in adjacent beats without taught pattern. Sentence openings vary well. No paraphrase loops or template cadence that touches closure. Clarity remains strong under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely propulsive with strong imagery: "wind did not blow so much as it bit," "ragged, archaic technique." Information density is high. However, multiple scaffold patterns appear: "not with weight, but with purpose" / "not with mortar, but with pure, suspended time"—template parallelism across two beats. "Brilliant dimness" recurs three times without on-page reweighting. The phrase "accommodates impossibilities" reads as prompt-label insertion. These artifacts cluster near closure, lowering line-level control and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, state, or stakes. Clarity remains strong through complex action (descent, archive navigation, jar release). Minor artifacts: "hides behind truth" template repeats across two beats; "turned to leave the library" / "began his ascent" are slight scaffolding moves. Figurative language mostly coheres ("meteor hush," "violet echoes"), but "wrapped in a silence that felt like a meteor hush" front-loads the metaphor before pressure warrants it. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks. Propulsion is steady; peak beats (jar opening, weeping) remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high: "foreign coins" immediately signals extinct empires and decoupled causality. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent phrasing: "It was a beautiful, tragic archive. Yet, as the transmission looped, a heavy, suffocating feeling…" reads as light paraphrase without added pressure. No figurative muddle or metaphor contradictions. One filter-verb stack: "He looked down… The doubt was vast… he forced his hand to move" could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual breathing room. Clarity is high; information density is strong in the crystallization sequence. Minor scaffold detected: "This was the echo of sacrifice, a resonance that lingered…" immediately followed by "The observatory was designed to catch the stars…" shifts topic abruptly without transitional tissue. "The tone of the moment was one of distant intimacy…" is meta-commentary that steps outside the scene to label rather than dramatize. Several metaphor vehicles cluster densely in peak beats ("fractured into a thousand dancing specks," "pulled the ink from the page and the terror from the memory," "geometric form took shape, rising… like a growing diamond") without muddle, but the density approaches overwriting. No loops or pronoun drift. One paraphrase echo: "crystallize the fear" / "Slowly, a geometric form took shape" restates the same event.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong rhythm variation. Opening anchors voice and stakes; the final image (geyser erupting) recharges prior material. Information density is high: "understanding dripping rates" does triple duty (characterization, world logic, method). Minor loop: "cosmic imbalance" appears three times, and "earnestly naive" / "innocent wonder" echo each other without added pressure. The phrase "He only knew the math of the fall" risks abstraction; "math" could be more concrete. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "seemed to liquefy") cluster in the second half without harming immediacy but prevent 9+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language (mirrored hush, skeletons of roofs, fungus) supports tone. Clarity is strong. Minor overwriting: "eerie phenomenon of the reservoir town resurfacing" and "the gentle reminder of the life that preceded it" read a touch scaffolded. The phrase "spin stories into shared meaning" leans expository. Paraphrase-loop check: the apothecary section slightly restates the poison legend across two sentences without added pressure. No major artifacts, but mid-band density and momentum leave room for tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery (kaleidoscopic waterfall, bruised purple sky, silver luminescence). However, several passages show template cadence and explanatory redundancy: "She had done it; she had bridged the divide. By accepting her hidden sentimentality and surrendering to the beauty of the starlings, she had rewritten the laws of matter" restates the same content across adjacent sentences without added pressure. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("solidified perception," "foundation of wonder," "apples and eternity") that dilute rather than sharpen the closure image. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with most sentences advancing multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies effectively between the extended opening atmospheric setup and the compressed repair sequence. Minor loop: "soundless echo" appears in paragraph 2 (atmosphere metaphor) and final line (thematic callback)—the reprise is purposeful but "echo" as descriptor feels slightly overworked. Opening paragraph "silence so profound it felt heavy" / "absence of sound was a physical weight" paraphrases across two sentences. "The watcher's burden" appears three times; each use shifts context but the phrase itself becomes visible as scaffold. Proofreading clean, no major artifacts, strong propulsion through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "colors that did not exist yesterday," "blade of solidified time," "absolute, undeniable truth," "violent shade of purple" stack figurative language without payoff (−0.5). Paraphrase loops: "ego death that left him a wandering ghost" / "synthetic shell" / "corrupted file" restate the same loss across three lines (−0.2). Template cadence: "Where Vane was fury, Kael was stillness. Where Vane was the storm, Kael was the vacuum" is a mechanical parallelism that flattens rhythm (−0.4). Cumulative artifacts: −1.1 in Q7; because one appears in the closure third, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong sensory specificity ("fraying rope," "jagged roar," "grey fog"). However, figurative density is high throughout, particularly in the opening third: "nadir of existence," "recursive geometry," "viscous medium," "calcified silence," "macerate," "liquefying the hard knots" cluster metaphors without always clarifying. "Mournfully eager" and "tragic paradox" in close succession feel slightly redundant. The phrase "the unspoken" appears twice conceptually. Sentence openings vary well, and no template cadence appears. Information density is high, though some lines do double metaphorical work rather than advance causality. No loops or major artifacts, but the metaphoric load approaches overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions (e.g., "frost clinging to ancient tomes was not made of water, but of solidified silence" establishes setting, tone, and surreal world rules). Rhythm modulates well—longer contemplative sentences in paragraph one accelerate to sharper syntax when the intruder arrives. Two minor issues reduce the score: "the core concept of my exile: the boundaries of light" is a thesis-statement beat that could trust the image more, and "through the swirling vapor of my own exhaled thoughts" stacks metaphor without added clarity. No loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, avoiding muddle in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout with largely coherent metaphors (solidification of time, frozen bloom, creeping paralysis). However, the opening paragraph stacks abstractions ("fading of light but a solidification of time, a creeping gray paralysis") without sufficient breathing space, and "arrested smoke" + "frozen bloom" crowd the same image. "The penny drops" is a stock phrase. Paraphrase loops appear: "survival required a radical, terrifying shift" is immediately echoed by "embrace the dangerous core concept of creative destruction." The closure beat remains clear, limiting total penalty, but pervasive figurative layering in high-pressure moments reduces propulsion by ~−0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (most lines do double duty: "groaned under the stress of the rising wind" = setting + threat). Clarity is strong with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled: "serenely electric" and "shard of hush" are specific and non-contradictory. Minor density lapse: "It was strictly a maintenance run, or so the guild master had claimed, but the sky told a distinctly different story" delays concrete stakes with a stock mystery frame. The phrase "pregnant with potential" in describing silence is close to cliché but redeemed by the immediate tactile follow-up.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "ancient, forgotten secrets" / "permanently transient" / "eternally waiting" recycle the suspension concept without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She understood... She adjusted... She turned..."). Mixed metaphor: clocks run "sideways" and hands "slid horizontally off the watch face, pointing accusingly"—the accusation contradicts the earlier neutrality of sideways motion. "Resiliently positive" and "infectious cheer" are stock phrases. The closure image is vivid (ocean spray, sunlight) but preceded by abstract assertions ("sheer force of her hopeful will"). No major opacity, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence structure modulates between long lyrical constructions and shorter beats during crisis. High information density: most lines advance both atmosphere and plot. Minor template-cadence slip in the middle third: several "The [noun] [verb]" constructions cluster without pattern payoff. One paraphrase loop: "the texture he had sought" and "the texture of connection" restate within three lines. The final image—"twisted into a single, coherent line of white light"—lands cleanly. No filter-verb stacks; figurative language (fever dream, sinew thread, sticky texture) remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and the opening/closing anchor with pressure gauges and darkness frames the arc. "He typed a sequence… heart beating a slow, heavy rhythm" propels without padding. Minor template cadence in mid-passage: "He engaged… He reached out… He picked up… He saw… He calculated" stacks three or more similar stems in sequence, a −0.4 deduction. No paraphrase loops, figurative language is coherent, and the final image ("clutching the rusted iron link like a prayer") charges without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clear and propulsive with varied sentence rhythm and strong concrete nouns (velvet box, ozone, beige casing). Several beats carry high information density (the hearing aid discovery paragraph). However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "the frantic terror shifting into a cautious rhythm" echoes "fluttering pulse slowed"; "unsolved puzzle" and "persistently curious" recur as template phrases. The phrase "reeling hush" appears twice in slightly different forms. Elevated metaphoric density in non-climactic passages ("arterial lines of affection," "jagged rhythm radiating") creates textural weight without advancing pressure. Stock embodiment: "cold sweat prickling her neck," "adrenaline drained from her limbs." Mixed metaphor: "shadows lunged, wisps of gray smoke grasping"—shadows and smoke conflated without clear transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies across beats, but several passages stack figurative language densely: "glorified tin can," "parasitic barnacle," "clawed at his throat," "weaponizing the dense silence," "ghostly storm," "massive black snake" within a short span. The phrase "a crashing hush in his bones" in the opening and "heavier than before" near the end both describe silence with near-synonym constructions. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "watched") appear frequently but remain voice-legible. Minor paraphrase loops: "the unremembered" recurs four times in similar framing. Information density is high in technical beats (phase transitions, calibration anchor), though some lines do double work explaining rather than advancing. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the density of metaphor in high-pressure moments (climax sequence) slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong concrete imagery: "curved walls...mimicking the interior of a precious stone," "conductive India ink," "figure woven from light and static." Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Minor issues: "the chaotic hiss of the shortwave receiver" and "the atmospheric interference had finally settled" restate the same condition across adjacent sentences (paraphrase loop, −0.2). "Seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven; he resumed the count" closes with clean specificity. No metaphor tangles or scaffold loops beyond the one slip.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, but several lines carry overwriting: "jagged, calcified perimeter," "damp walls with a diction so crisp it seemed to physically slice the stagnant air," and "glorious moment" inflate texture without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "skeletal fingers grasping at the violet twilight." Template cadence in the opening (three consecutive sentences begin with noun phrases describing setting features). No paraphrase loops detected. Clarity remains strong, and the closure beat avoids artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("to the old herbalist, Silas, Elias was merely a drift-less wanderer seeking shelter, but in truth…"). However, the middle section leans on stock metaphors and declarative exposition: "a frequency that bypassed the ears and vibrated the soul" is abstract; "pouring his bile into the electronic hiss" is cliché. The phrase "a chorus of lost voices trying to find a shape" is evocative but unearned—no prior beat dramatizes these voices. Minor scaffold: "It was—or had been—Silas's brother" repeats the specimen's identity without adding pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs, but figurative density in the ritual sequence ("cosmic punchlines," "bile," "void") accumulates without fresh vehicle specificity, applying a −0.3 deduction within the 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies well and information density is high ("a square mile of ancient, magical forestry trapped within the industrial sprawl and policed by living statues"). However, the piece carries some overwriting: "syncing the draw of her bow to the diastolic thump of her blood" stacks medical precision onto a peak beat, and "the gap between knowing and understanding" paraphrases itself in the next line. The locust-shell exposition ("the ultimate symbol of the core concept of breaking free; it was the fragile evidence...") loops concept redundantly. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "The sound drifted... Below, the bronze sentinels... Their clockwork heads..." No major scaffold loops, but figurative density in the climax ("the atmosphere curdled into a state of tarnished wonder") risks slight muddle. Apply −0.6 for overwriting and paraphrase loops in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. A few phrases approach overwriting without crossing into opacity: "cognitive paradox," "respectfully rebellious," "data spaces that the machines ignored." No loops or synonym churn; no template cadence. The storm metaphor is sustained and coherent. Propulsion is strong through the border crossing; the final paragraph breathes appropriately. Minor tonal drift: "kinetic rage" and "volatile orphan" feel slightly elevated but remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is abundant but controlled in most beats. Information density is high in the oasis discovery and singing sequence. However, the opening and middle sections show overwriting: "expanding sphere of that single, long-decaying note," "thick, misting hush permeated the air, a supernatural dampness," "vast and quiet marble waiting to be chiseled" stack elevated metaphors without always serving immediate pressure. The phrase "low-level radiance that seemed to hum with a frequency just below the threshold of human hearing" is technically precise but tonally clinical. Minor template cadence: "He did not speak… he simply built, carving… sanding…" and "He took a wrong turn, stepping through… but instead opened…" echo similar stems. No loops or scaffold obscure causality, so artifacts remain in the non-closure zone, capping deduction at −0.8 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid specifics ("saddle shapes," "liquid mercury," "ozone tang"), and rhythm varies across beats. Two issues prevent higher scoring: minor scaffold phrases ("It was an object of intense fragility, its hem unraveling like a forgotten thought, yet it vibrated...") stack modifiers without propulsion, and a paraphrase loop appears when "analog memories" and "residual heat of a moment" restate the same idea across adjacent sentences. The closure image is clean, but these artifacts in the middle third reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentences carry momentum, but figurative density is high in nearly every line without pattern-teaching: "fabric of the night began to fray," "photon spill," "viscous potential," "burning map of her desire," "harmless dust motes." Mixed metaphors appear ("cipher of longing" shifts to "emotional code," then "geometric form to the ghost"). Register occasionally drifts elevated ("sanctuary she had never visited but loved desperately"). Template cadence in the climax: "She constructed... She dipped... Elara worked..." The cascade of metaphors in peak beats triggers −0.5 for density and −0.3 for coherence under the Overwriting Checks, preventing entry to 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.3)
    Overwriting pervades: "converging point where the geometry of existence folded like heavy velvet," "raw entropy," "nebulous color," "vibrato of a song" stack metaphorical vehicles without grounding. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("realignment of the universe's indifferent gaze," "celestial keyhole") that clashes with the woman's direct emotional state. Paraphrase loops appear: "enveloped secrets, whispering continuously" in paragraph one is echoed by "The enveloped secrets unfurled like smoke" in paragraph three without advancing pressure. Template cadence: "Silas took… Silas knew… Silas watched… Silas replied… Silas handed… Silas stepped" creates a drumbeat rhythm across the second half. Filter-verb stack in paragraph two: "feeling the cold, paralyzing weight… He turned his eyes… He waited… scanning the darkening horizon." The final paragraph's "improbable longing for what else might be unlocked" recycles the prompt phrase verbatim, reading as scaffolding rather than earned closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances setting, character, or pressure. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm accelerates cleanly into the closure beat. The loop check passes: no paraphrase cycles or template cadence. Minor deductions: "chronically curious mind" and "feverish intensity" trend toward label-speak, and "raw, open wound" is a stock metaphor. The phrase "the theft had occurred when he was a young man, foolish enough to barter" reads slightly expository. Overall clarity and propulsion are strong, with figurative language mostly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: "combative tenderness thick in his throat" and "forcing his feet to remain planted so she would learn to stand hers" each do multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the striking sequence. Minor pattern appears in paired "He [verb]" constructions mid-story but remains voice-coherent and doesn't loop. The "annotate the prison's surface with binding runes that would actually weaken" beat could compress slightly—"binding runes that would actually weaken the structure if struck correctly from within" holds some scaffold—but the line advances causality and the overwriting doesn't obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and many sentences do double duty (e.g., "These were no ordinary blades; they were forged to slice through the thick skin of reality by capturing essence rather than destroying matter"). Clarity is high and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, several lines loop conceptually: "preserve the color of wonder" appears three times, "insatiably creative" twice, and the final paragraph recycles "preserve" and "harvest" without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the reflection-heavy final third ("He would not let… not while…"). Minor −0.4 deduction for paraphrase loops; no artifacts touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance action, atmosphere, or interiority. Minor overwriting in the opening ("cold needles of luminescence," "fractured porcelain of a Nö-mask") borders on algorithmic density without pattern-teaching, though it does not obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language ("thick, invisible syrup," "pale fish darting") is coherent but slightly stacked in mid-beats. Proofreading is clean; grammar and tense are consistent. The final line recharges the cage motif effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; information density is high (profession, goal, method, dual footage all established efficiently). No loops or synonym churn detected. A few lines edge toward over-figuration: "spectral pantomimes," "triangulated its exact coordinates," "incensed air rose to meet the damp wind"—elevated but not opaque. The closing image ("dripping from her fingertips") is clean. One template stem: "She did not... she..." near the end, but isolated. Clarity and propulsion hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, character method, or thematic pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative constructions in the library exploration giving way to shorter, directive syntax at the climax ("He reached out and placed his hand over the glass sphere"). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences that restate the transmission concept ("It was a scream of refusal that had never ended" follows closely on "driven by the energy of a man who had refused to accept his fate"), creating slight redundancy. Figurative language (spiderwebs made of lead, gray fog of pulp) is vivid but occasionally dense without full integration into action. No major loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. Minor scaffold appears: "a sound of creation and repair, a whimsical mechanical beat" paraphrases "tinkersong wonder" without added pressure. "Encode his message through messages encoded" is a visible loop. The figurative density ("sky bruised," "mist curled," "shockwave rattled") is controlled and does not muddle peak beats. No major clarity breaks, but the prose occasionally leans decorative ("chaotic tag in neon blue") where a sharper verb would advance momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("frozen needle piercing the sky," "sun to filter through heavy glass"). However, several phrases approach overwriting: "discovery waiting to happen" is abstract, "climaxes into a kaleidoscope" stacks metaphor, and "allowing him the clarity to see what the grieving family could not" tells rather than trusts the dramatization. Minor paraphrase: "tarnished brass frames, the airship captain's goggles" and "pressed the goggles against the open page, allowing the sun to filter through" recycle phrasing. No major loops or scaffold, but density could tighten in the final paragraph where "validating his theory" and "the mystery resolved" summarize rather than image the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "cold metal biting into his fingertips" grounds sensation and establishes his embodied presence). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("oil on water," "spooled wholeness," "gray stupor of the drift"). Minor density slip: "It was his duty to record these ephemeral monuments before the solar winds scoured them into nothingness" states rather than enacts duty, slightly dulling momentum. The final paragraph's shift to "vast library" and "sole librarian" risks edging into metaphor-summary, but the sketch drying on the page returns to concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. The opening creates strong atmosphere. Minor loop: "discovering limits" appears in paragraph 2 ("terrifying plateau...limits he had never encountered") and returns nearly verbatim in paragraph 5 ("discovering limits not of his skill, but of existence itself")—this is thematic recurrence but borders on paraphrase. "Heightened stillness" recurs as bookend with purpose. Some elevated register ("encased within the building's foundations generations ago") occasionally lengthens without adding pressure, but propulsion remains strong and no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong imagery ("copper hull groaning rhythmically," "strobing pattern of darkness"). Information density is high; sentences often do double work (setting + mood, action + character). Minor template cadence appears in the middle third: "She knelt... She flipped... She raised..." runs stack slightly. The opening and closing lines anchor well. No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative density in some beats ("viscous and warm," "trapped star that had forgotten how to burn out") verges on overwriting without obscuring clarity. Syntax varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting is evident in the opening paragraph: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor ("driftwood nostalgia," "bleached ribcage of a leviathan," "receded cosmic tide") without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.5 in Q7. "Hall of mirrors" and "infinite regression of potential failures" also layer figurative density in adjacent lines. Paraphrase appears in the mirror sequence ("falling… shattering… wept"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully elsewhere, and the final paragraph breathes appropriately. Zero causality breaks or spatial incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clear, propulsive, and rhythmically varied, with strong information density (most lines advance character, setting, or plot). Figurative language is controlled and avoids muddle ("gravity...letting the granite...drift upward," "atmospheric band...thinning dangerously"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and closure effectively. Minor flourishes ("frozen lightning," "brambled hope") feel voice-motivated rather than overwritten. Zero scaffold or artifact debt touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high and sustained—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("ocean of history," "absolute zero of the void," "topographic map")—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff structure, triggering the density check (−0.5). Several lines loop or paraphrase: "the clock's hands ceased...shifted from ticking to humming" / "vibrations shifted" restates the same event; "terrible and holy" / "bruised awe" / "grandeur of annihilation tempered by persistence" recycle the same emotional claim across adjacent beats (−0.4 paraphrase loop). The puppet "dissolved" to convert matter to energy, then the lighthouse "unspool[ed]" and Silas "los[t] coherence"—three consecutive dissolutions with synonym churn (−0.3). Clarity remains intact, but momentum drags under the ornamental load. Information density is moderate; many sentences elaborate texture without advancing plot or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, action, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary naturally. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language ("bleeding crimson light," "shimmered like heat rising") is purposeful and coherent. One minor softness: "could only be described as" is a tell construction, but it doesn't obscure causality. Grammar and tense are clean. The final paragraph's rhythm slows appropriately to charge the closure image. Paragraph structure varies; each unit advances knowledge or pressure. Zero scaffold, zero muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies well ("The braided ravine stretched out..." versus shorter beats at the insight). Information density is high in the middle third, though the opening carries some scaffold ("a trait he had shared with his late wife, a cellist who had taught him"). The phrase "tone of loosened grief" in paragraph four reads awkward—"tone" is an odd noun choice for the feeling state. The climax pivot (foam to molecular eddy) is clear, but the final two paragraphs contain mild paraphrase loops: "pieces fall into place" / "rushing sound... like applause" / "separation... finally closing" all restate triumph without added nuance. No major artifacts touch closure directly, keeping penalty moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong information density; nearly every sentence advances concept, atmosphere, or Elian's demonstration. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("cut a shadow," "violin string snapping in a deep frost," "thirsty for the final solvent"). Minor overwriting cluster: "heavy, jagged edges of the pasts they represented, creating an aesthetic of integrated fragmentation" layers abstract nouns without concrete anchoring. The phrase "spectral residue" and "glimmering parole" appear in rapid succession, creating slight synonym churn around the core image. A few stock constructions ("the bell above the door finally rang, shattering the peace") and the cliché "hiding the scalpel behind his back" reduce freshness at the closure beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff (e.g., "shipwreck stranded on a mountaintop," "culinarian of the psyche," "pantry of the past," "blizzard of silent screams" all within ~600 words). Several metaphors lean abstract or mixed: "false tide," "thermal anomalies hiding beneath sand" (thermal reads odd for cold), "chewed slowly, breaking down the structure of the regret" (physical chewing of emotional construct). Template cadence appears in opening: "She was a chef... She did not come... Her eyes scanned..." Paraphrase loop: paragraphs three and four both establish that the pavilion houses frozen guilt. Clarity remains mostly intact, but overwriting in peak beats (the ingestion sequence) reduces propulsion. No major grammar errors; prose is polished but not economical.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity is strong, with varied sentence structure and purposeful compression in most beats. However, several artifacts lower the score: "These massive, sentient structures" and "proving that their survival depended on connection rather than hoarding" edge toward summary; "the chaotic noise from the valley synchronized into a low, steady chord" tells the resolution rather than dramatizing the silos' shift. A paraphrase loop appears in the tower-slowing sequence (groaned/struggled, tempo dropped/thud). These issues do not obscure closure but dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance concept or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "To an observer, her workspace looked like a disaster of tangled wires" and "every connection she forged followed a rigorous, non-linear mathematical logic" restate the chaotic/precise duality without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the neural-coupling paragraph: "She closed her eyes… This was… A child's desire… Because the memories…" The phrase "helix-minded engineer" and "recursive geometry" read as thesaurus-itis—elevated diction that doesn't clarify. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "silver scar" and "spiderweb of fissures" work, though "trembling waves of pure emotion" at closure verges on stock abstraction. Sentence variation is present, and no major grammar slips.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is textured and rhythmically varied, but density issues accumulate: "the air suddenly ionized, tasting sharply of ozone and ancient dust" stacks sensory modifiers without advancing action. "Serpentine grotto in mist, a chaotic network of tunnels carved into the underside of the floating archipelago that usually served as the canyon's ceiling" loops spatial description. Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats ("strobe light," "seed with crack," "intestines") without clear pattern-teaching. Register drifts into elevated academic phrasing ("metaphysical tumblers," "cognitive anomaly") during peak action, reducing immediacy. Applying −0.8 for density and coherence issues in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the strum sequence and breathing during observation. Information density is high: nearly every line advances character understanding, world-building, or pressure. Minor issues: "He would not move until the natural omens were precise" followed immediately by detailed description of what he's watching creates slight redundancy. The phrase "symphonically minded, viewing the interplay of light, shadow, and matter not as visual data but as a suspended score" edges toward over-explanation. One paraphrase near the end: "the vibration thrumming through the ground and into his bones" after "a sound...that expanded outward in concentric rings" covers similar conceptual ground. No major loops or scaffold, but these small slips prevent entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or the central puzzle. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the epiphany ("It was a defensive formation, specifically the intricate lattice…") and breathing at closure. Minor template cadence in adjacent beats: "He believed that…," "He realized with sudden clarity…," "He had spent years teaching…" creates a faint scaffold echo. One paraphrase loop: "The spirits were not attacking…nor had they abandoned" restates the same negation. Figurative language (chess metaphors) is purposeful and coherent, though dense in the climax; the pattern is taught early and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is mostly clear with varied syntax and strong imagery ("the dusty, relieved silence of a confession finally whispered"). Minor scaffold appears: "He struck a low-C fork and held it near the clasp. The metal remained inert, a cold and stubborn lump of silence" restates inertness without added pressure. Some filter-verb stacks ("feeling for the vibration," "watching the tiny brass mechanism") in mid-sequence slightly dull immediacy. Figurative density in the opening paragraph (motley coat harmonizing textures, velvet cuffs, eclectic pacifist) front-loads description without immediate causal work. Final image propulsion is adequate but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "the coarse texture… felt right… a humble contrast to the biological grandeur"). Sentence openings vary and the escalating tempo in the bloom sequence ("She inhaled sharply… She grabbed a sheet… With frantic but precise strokes") propels effectively. Minor loop: "the developing stench was not repulsive but complex" in paragraph eight and "it was not simply mimicking death" in the bloom sequence restate the complexity claim without added detail. One figurative phrase ("thrust upward like a dark spear") is apt, but "a symphony played in a minor key" and "broadcasting an ancient chemical library" stack metaphors in the climax without full coherence, triggering a small overwriting penalty. No major template cadence or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—every beat advances discovery or stakes. However, figurative language clusters in the opening and amphitheater paragraphs: "shattered emerald," "groped blindly," "garden of peace," "harmonic chord that vibrated through her bones." Mixed metaphor: "unspooling upward in shimmering, cohesive ribbons" + "liquid guide" + "vein" overloads the water image. "Whirling silence" is paradoxical but unclear—does it mean rotating quiet or chaotic hush? These artifacts dull immediacy in peak beats, triggering −0.5 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, and information density is high. However, several figurative constructions in high-pressure beats risk overwriting: "predatory vortices," "chaotic geology," "singing a song of warning." The phrase "rapidly adapting to the slightest structural change" is told rather than shown through sensor feedback. Paragraph five contains mild paraphrase loop: "invisible hazards" and "predictive models" restate the foresight mission without added pressure. Template cadence appears in "She pulled out... She wanted... She descended..." No scaffolding obscures causality, but the density of metaphor and summary moments in technical beats caps the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled ("curated silence," "fossilized fire," "ink into water"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or ritual logic. Paraphrase loops are minimal. However, several stock metaphors appear without fresh grounding ("phantom pressure," "wave of inspiration"), and the phrase "oscillating repose" recurs without evolving. The final paragraph's "proving that the intangible was the only thing that made the tangible worth enduring" is abstract thesis-speak that could be cut. Propulsion is steady but lacks sentence-level urgency in the middle beats where Elian prepares without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. However, minor loops and near-synonym churn appear: "driving the barrier" vs. "the night the barrier fell," "weaving between worlds" repeated across paragraphs without added pressure, and "the weight of it feeling different now" after "burden and joy" feels slightly paraphrased. The phrase "avalanchingly quiet" is vivid but borders on strained metaphor mixing (avalanche implies sound/motion; quiet is absence). The final paragraph summarizes departure steps rather than compressing, slightly dulling momentum. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("fossilized shard of divinity scavenged from the ruins of a dead seraph" does world-building, object work, and tonal lift simultaneously). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor register drift: "psychic labor," "semantic anchors," "cognitive" frame occasionally edges toward academic diction that slightly exceeds the established voice's idiom, though it remains legible. The phrase "lucid turbulence" and "transposed empathy" are conceptually dense but border on abstraction without always grounding in concrete image. One scaffold moment: "This confusion was necessary" tells the reader what the prior paragraph showed.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor stakes and image. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "churning in a silent, majestic storm that mocked her human fragility" and "prismatic core… bloomed, shooting upward to intertwine with the green ribbons" stack figurative language without clarity gain (−0.5). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She was… / He had left… / Kaelen had told…" (−0.4). Paraphrase loop near the end: "The magic within activated… / Time warped around her…" restates temporal extension without added pressure (−0.2). Artifacts touch the closure beat (floating pendant, dissolving into brilliance), triggering cumulative penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and most lines advance story or atmosphere. The opening effectively anchors voice and stakes. However, several passages show overwriting: "surreal cathedral of jagged, semi-precious spires that spiraled upward to pierce the heavy, gray mist" stacks modifiers without adding pressure; "silent reservoirs for the intensity of human experience" and "emotional reality of that final drive" drift into abstraction. The "truthful lies" frame is invoked three times with slight variations, creating conceptual redundancy. Line-level clarity is strong overall, but figurative density in descriptive beats (quartz arbor, frost patterns) occasionally slows momentum without teaching a lyric pattern that pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentences propel; information density is high. However, figurative language clusters densely in the opening and middle without full payoff: "question mark," "drinking from soil that tasted of lost years," "white noise of nothingness," "ocean of non-existence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry." Mixed metaphor near the end: "tapestry...shot forward like a bullet" jars physical logic (fabric as projectile). Register drifts slightly elevated for a character under mortal pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the metaphor density and one vehicle clash pull the score down. Clarity holds and the closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good. However, several lines loop or restate: "He was quietly determined, possessing a fortitude…" closely paraphrases the prior sentence; "The trade he offered was the sacrifice…" / "He wrapped the deceptive, unbreakable silk…" / "'Take this,' he whispered…" all recount the same action across three beats. Template cadence appears in the descent sequence ("He paused… He tied… He lowered…"). Stock metaphor "the universe seemed to hold its breath" and elevated register ("azure defiance," "transmuting") in peak beats drift from Ewan's focalization. Functional clarity, but loops and figurative overreach in high-pressure moments prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies—long atmospheric opener, tighter action in the vision sequence, measured closure. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "the green glass shard had drawn blood" is both physical cost and symbolic breach). Two minor artifacts: "the air pressure drop, a sudden vacuum" is near-paraphrase, and "the revelation hit her with physical force, slamming her back" uses a stock metaphor. No loops or scaffold otherwise. Sentence openings vary. Clarity is consistent. The final line—"struggling to carry the immense, invisible weight of the withheld truth she had forced the universe to yield"—is slightly overwritten but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density, strong rhythm control, and vivid figurative language ("rhythmic rotation, plunging the ocean into abrupt, suffocating blindness"; "silence like a heavy coat"). Syntax varies purposefully, and the final line ("leaving behind a single, glowing ember of safety") delivers resonant closure. Minor deductions: "human erosion" and "accumulated psychic weight" risk abstraction; "luminescent ache" in the climax is evocative but borders on purple. Template cadence in paragraphs 2–3 (repeated "He was…" stems) costs clarity. No paraphrase loops or significant scaffold, but the stacked metaphors in the haunted-room description (shadows not empty but heavy, eager to reclaim) slightly blur focus. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most sentences advance action, atmosphere, or Silas's ritual logic. Figurative language ("total internal reflection...refused to escape, bouncing frantically inside the rod") is grounded in physical process. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "shadowed elation" appears twice, "green" modifies "glow," "fire," and "shadow" across adjacent beats, and "the magic happened" + "The beam erupted" rely on stock intensifiers. "Stroke the cooling glass wick, whispering affectionately to the storm" in the penultimate paragraph reads as puppet-master choreography without adding new pressure. Apply −0.6 for patterned figurative density and minor loop.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is largely clean with high information density and purposeful figurative language (syncopated rhythm, iridescent caution, cyan pressure). Minor template cadence appears in mid-story descriptive beats ("He checked…," "He picked up…," "He realized…") but doesn't obscure causality. One paraphrase loop: "reaction was immediate and quietly explosive" followed by "sudden, expanding pulse" restates effect without adding new information, costing −0.2. The opening and closing images are strong; sentence variety supports rhythm. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; technical terms (refractive index, morpho wing ridges) read accurate and integrated. Overall propulsion is solid but the scaffold repetition and one synonym cycle keep this from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clarity is generally high, and information density is solid. Rhythm varies, though some sentences open with similar participial structures ("Elias sighed, adjusting…"; "Elias waited, his hand hovering…"). A minor paraphrase loop appears: "quantified sorrow, an emotional refuse" is restated as "the sorrow was too volatile" without adding new pressure. Figurative density is high in the opening third ("heavy exhalations of thunder," "vegetative nervous system," "psychic mortar," "flies in amber") and some metaphors mix registers. The pin-drop beat is clean and propulsive. Overall, scaffold is minimal, but the piece leans toward overwriting in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high throughout. However, figurative language saturates nearly every line ("crushing weight of obsidian sky," "voice...a structural force, a harmonic scaffolding," "drowning woman," "bowstring pulled to its absolute, trembling limit"), creating density that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure's emotional weight ("her duty fulfilled," "some things...could never be undone"), landing on abstraction when a concrete image would sharpen the cost. Minor template cadence in the swaddling sequence: "She wrapped...binding...This act..." No paraphrase loops, but the elevated register never breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse; information density is high in the threshold-crossing paragraph. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "the air around him shifted, settling into a state of enlarged tranquility, a vast and expanding peace" restates the same content; "He pulled his aura inward, shrinking his psychic footprint" could merge with prior description. Template cadence appears in the empathy setup: "To his left, a commuter worried… to his right, a student despaired" reads mechanical. Figurative language ("crumpled invitation burning a hole," "nestled paradoxes") is purposeful but dense in spots without pattern-teaching payoff. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, capping below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("It was the time after...," "He was here for guerrilla gardening...") and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "guilt that plagued him" and "tenuous absolution" are conceptually adjacent but the second reweights the first through the meal. A small register drift: "heuristically gentle" and "elevating the simple act" lean academic for a moment of hunger, though they're voice-consistent overall. The opening and closing images ("sky was finally empty" / "the sacred endured") frame cleanly. No major opacity or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and technical terminology (vernier dial, oscilloscope, resonance chamber) reads plausible. Information density is high in the measurement sequence. However, several ornamental metaphors lack concrete grounding: "sea of stagnant, bruised clouds," "figures made of golden fire...tearing apart like smoke caught in a sudden gale." The phrase "ghost of a summer that had ended centuries ago" offers mood but no new pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 10–11 restate the fading energy without added detail ("needle began to drop" / "figures flickered" / "energy reserves faded").

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the false-start sequence. Information density is high; most lines advance pressure or atmosphere. Two artifacts: "The comfort of the gloom seemed to tighten around them, a suffocating embrace that kept the rest of the market's cutthroats in the shadows" offers metaphor redundancy (tighten/suffocate/embrace) that slows momentum. "Minutes dragged like anchors in the deep mud" is a functional simile but slightly stock. The final paragraph's "warm satisfaction" feels over-tidy after life-or-death stakes. No loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (genetically modified skin, arboreal democracy, emergent compass, weather-carriers). Some overwriting in descriptive beats: "the ozone of the northern lights to create an atmosphere that felt terrestrially cosmic" stacks modifiers without adding pressure. Figurative language is dense ("dragging localized thunderstorms and droughts across borders like heavy, atmospheric luggage") but mostly coherent. One paraphrase loop: "refusing to accept the popular theory" and "she had wanted to dismantle a myth" restate skepticism. The closure beat is clear, though "overwhelmingly" is a weak intensifier. No major loops or scaffold, but density occasionally substitutes for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: "light… bled from the stones," "charcoal dragged across the paper with a visceral rasp." However, the piece shows repeated scaffold phrasing and template cadence: "He was not merely seeking… he was here because," "It was not merely about… but about," "He was no longer… he was." The lock is described as "frozen by rust and misuse" then immediately "he could no longer finesse his way through," creating a paraphrase loop. Register drift into elevated abstractions ("auroral sorrow," "spiritual imperative," "mnemonic gift") in multiple beats adds −0.5. The final paragraph over-explains rather than trusting image, lowering propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is mostly strong. Information density is high in the plate-reading beat. However, the final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "lost conversations were not just whispers; they were systemic erasures" restates the plate's content without advancing pressure, and "knowing that her gold ink would no longer be used for decoration" summarizes the choice rather than dramatizing it. "Overgrave" (paragraph 3) reads as a typo or neologism without context. Minor figurative muddle: "sickening drain in her chest" followed by "knees buckling" and "edges of her vision grayed" stacks bodily metaphors without fresh specificity. No major loops elsewhere; clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several issues accumulate. Template cadence appears in the opening exposition: "In the centuries… after words… the world settled… High above… Elara prepared…" echoes an outline structure. Paraphrase loop: "The sound was not a melody… but a roar… These were the symphonies of truth, notes that did not lie…" restates the same claim across adjacent lines. Register drift into academic phrasing ("thermodynamics," "mathematical inevitability") clashes with the embodied stakes. Figurative language is dense ("jagged and unpredictable," "indigo and crimson," "loud, messy, beautiful collision") but mostly coherent. Applying −0.8 for template cadence and paraphrase issues; no closure-beat artifact observed.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high (the opening paragraph establishes setting, character, crisis, and backstory efficiently). The transfer sequence propels through clear steps. However, template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "He looked back... He had incinerated... He walked into..." (three consecutive "He [verb]" stems). Paraphrase loop: "the volatile energy of the fears as fuel" (paragraph two) and "the incinerated fears" (paragraph three) restate the same mechanism without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "ghosts in his machine" is a well-worn phrase. The phrase "neutron star" and "hurricane" are vivid but not anchored in Seven's technical lexicon—would an android use astronomical metaphor under peak stress? Minor overwriting in "a lonely silhouette against the horizon, carrying nothing but the empty box and a quiet, unified soul" (three modifiers in the closure beat). Accumulation: −0.8 for template cadence and paraphrase loop; both touch the final third but not the exact closure sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "terrifying composure," "deafening noise that erased solutions," "invisible to the naked eye" (a *thunk* cannot be seen), "gunshot in the sudden quiet," "shield" locket, "loudest victory." Mixed metaphor: "sandstorm calm" implies violent stillness, yet Elara's affect reads as serene throughout with no textural shift under stress. Template cadence: "She did not approach…instead, she moved…She sat…She moved…She pressed…She spun…She traced" in close succession. Paraphrase loop: the opening's "panic was a deafening noise" is echoed by "their panic dissolved" and "listening heals the fractures that fear creates." Filter-verb stack in the lock sequence ("heard a faint…felt the vibration…heard…") dulls immediacy. The closure beat ("quietest method…loudest victory") is abstracted by cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the dance sequence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense ("déjà vu so potent it tasted like salt and iron," "dissipate like ink in water") but coherent and apt. However, several lines carry minor overwriting: "a sensation of mysterious familiarity wash over her, a déjà vu so potent it tasted..." restates the same idea. "The presence in the room shifted, the oppressive weight lifting" is abstract where concrete sensation would sharpen. The scaffold phrase "She did not type commands into the keyboard; the interface was far more advanced" is a boilerplate clarification that slows momentum. Final image is strong but the penultimate paragraph summarizes ("The familiarity was no longer mysterious") rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: "cathedral of white sodium facets," "crusty bank," "gravity shrieked" all carry high information density. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the fluctuation ("Weightlessness seized him, lifting his boots…") and breathing at closure. Minor: "a small packet" and "a small trowel" repeat the modifier; "the gleaming silence pressed" recurs without full pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold, and figurative language remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several runs lean toward template cadence and decorative phrasing. "The atmosphere in this secluded glade was charged with a tranquil blaze, a paradoxical intensity that burned with a cold, spiritual light without singeing the damp ferns" stacks modifiers without advancing causality. Paraphrase loops appear: "the chaotic sounds of the night" echoes "aggressive whispering of the trees" and "ominous rhythm of the water" in adjacent beats. Stock metaphor strings ("liquid obsidian," "blanket of stardust") and elevated register ("lattice of negation," "vacuum for the chaotic frequencies") cluster in peak moments, dulling immediacy. No critical causality breaks, but cumulative minor slips lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong momentum and vivid imagery ("scratches on a developed negative," "spider-thin fingers"). Two issues: "patiently nimble" is a slightly strained pairing, and "mysterious familiarity" in the narration reads as template phrasing. Minor density lapse: "the fiction served them both" followed immediately by what the fiction gave each is near-redundant. No major loops or scaffold, and the final line ("I believe I am ready to conjugate the verb *to endure*") carries weight. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong specificity ("velvet ground," "whispering seashell half"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in the opening: "thick enough to stroke" and "charmed skeptic wavering" both describe her state within two lines. A slight paraphrase loop: "tragically radiant" echoed by "terrible, beautiful luminescence" without added pressure. Information density is high overall, and the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or the forgery's mechanics. Sentence openings vary and rhythm accelerates during the thorn-lift. However, three loops appear: "silent" recurs (rivers of light, silent work), "the rose thorn" is named identically across four beats without pronominal compression, and "the heavy iron cylinder/rod" toggles weight descriptors. Register drift is minimal but present: "linguistic bond," "magnetic counter-resonance," and "fibrous heart" elevate diction beyond Elian's crisis state in adjacent lines, applying −0.5 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb/artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but a template cadence emerges: "She [verb]" openers repeat across paragraphs (13, 16, 23, 25, 27, 29), creating a mechanical drumbeat that flattens momentum in the second half. "Webs of intrigue" recurs three times without added nuance (paragraphs 9, 10, 18), edging toward synonym churn. Two figurative phrases—"invisible webs of intrigue woven by the Silent Council, traps made of sound rather than steel" and "universe hums its secret song"—are evocative but border on stock in a magic-realism context. Clarity and concision are strong in the acoustic beats; the shell "grew hot," the echo "surfaced," and these images propel. No major loops or causality breaks, but the template stems and phrase recycling prevent entry into the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual breath. However, mid-story exposition loops conceptually: "objects held the psychic resonance" is restated as "the spirit attached to this relic was elusive," and the dream-tracking method is explained twice (global archives, then "windows of connection"). Template cadence appears in the dream-shard catalog: "He appeared again… standing silently… watching from the shadows." The tense slip "Elara weaves truth carefully" (present tense amid past-tense narration) is minor but noted. Peak beats favor clarity, yet information density sags in the middle third where method is told rather than dramatized. No catastrophic artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied with high information density ("draft…audible friction of the world turning"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "stray embers from a celestial fire" and "harmonics of stone and air" work. However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats without clear payoff, and the closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("lattice of cause and effect," "conceptual rift") that slightly dull momentum. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in the final third prevents 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across descriptive, action, and interiority modes. Information density is high (each paragraph advances situation or knowledge). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor artifact: "Being sharply observant, Elias noticed" is a filter-stack opener that could be cut for immediacy. The repair sequence ("His fingers flew... adjusting the torque and voltage until the vibration smoothed") delivers clear propulsion without figurative muddle. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image ("turned to walk back through the silent trees") that is clean but somewhat generic. Proofreading is clean; no homophones or tense slips. Overall strong line-level control with no artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("cathedral of gritty whimsy," "fever map," "ghostly will"). Clarity is mostly strong, though density dips in the middle third with synonym loops: "manipulate," "orchestrate," "shape," "manufactured" cluster without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle: "The narrative Silas had so carefully constructed began to unfold... Kael stopped waiting... The prophet shouted..." (three consecutive "The [subject] [verb]" stems). Overwriting is present in stacked metaphors ("ancient shadows," "fragmented frequencies," "wild magic," "cosmic inevitability") without full pattern-teaching. Closure beats are cleaner. Information density is high overall, but scaffold phrases like "with a sinking heart" and "finally understanding" dull immediacy at key moments. No major loops or causality breaks, but mid-story artifacts prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well; sensory density is high without overwhelming. Minor loop: "lonesome splendor" and "feral loft" recur without evolving pressure. Figurative language ("violet mist," "golden speck of sound") is coherent and supports tone. One template stem run: "He was…," "He had to…," "He reached…," "He uncorked…," "He worked…" in consecutive paragraphs, but not pervasive enough to flatten momentum. Information density is strong; no paraphrase loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong image density ("chaotic mosaic of fractured white slabs," "color of old bruises"). Figurative language is controlled and coherent, though "fleshly ethereal" in paragraph two is a near-oxymoron that borders on muddle. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. One scaffold phrase: "The spirits were screaming now" could integrate the escalation more tightly into action rather than declaring it. Information density is high; most lines advance setting, pressure, or character. Minor overwriting in the opening ("suspended violence," "restless echoes") elevates register slightly but remains voice-legible.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally high, and sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Three prose artifacts weaken the line level: (1) "magnetic viaduct after rain" is paraphrased twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure, (2) "watching how the freezing water created a conductive sheen" immediately follows "observed the magnetic viaduct after rain" in a synonym loop, and (3) the phrase "the wind whipped her cloak" / "the wind howled through the basalt columns" recycles wind imagery without functional variation. Apply cumulative penalty −0.9 in Q7 only. No loops touch the closure beat, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies. The final image ("silent and unstoppable as the winter frost") is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is vivid ("weeping wound," "lightning rod for trauma") but becomes slightly dense in the vision sequence without clear pattern payoff. Minor deductions: "watchfully calm" and "fortified vulnerability" read as constructed rather than immediate embodied states; "hooked into the living" and "dual-layer existence" edge toward conceptual summary. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Overall strong craft with a few abstract phrases that reduce immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence variety and rhythm support momentum, with the drape-opening sentence modulating pace effectively ("With a sudden, sweeping motion"). Some stock metaphor threads appear: "truth settling over him like a shroud," "hope wither," "guilt was a stone in his gut." The pairing "stopped time" / "suspended energy" in the opening paragraph borders on synonym churn but advances atmosphere rather than looping. Information density is generally high, each beat advancing knowledge or state. Minor register drift in "the frequency of his life" feels elevated for peak pressure but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the launch and breathing during observation beats. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor loop: "the yearning algorithm" recurs across paragraphs without functional variation, risking template cadence (-0.2). A few figurative phrases in the opening ("chaotic cathedral of refuse," "giggling madness of a jester") approach overwriting but remain legible and voice-consistent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. The final image ("laughing in static bursts") lands cleanly with concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance plot or atmosphere. Minor issues: "distinct and pressure-filled feeling" is slightly abstract; "adrenaline leaving a metallic taste" is stock. The phrase "sensed absence" recurs but serves the tone rather than looping content. "The silence of the room deepened, emphasizing the sensed absence" paraphrases the opening motif without added pressure (−0.2). No loops or scaffold mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. A few figurative phrases veer into density without clear payoff: "shadow-laced peacekeeper," "crushing expanse," "weighted breath before reply" cluster in the opening without constraining later action. The reconstitution sequence ("stitching the reflection and the object together with the force of his will") abstracts the peak beat rather than grounding it in sensory particulars. Minor template phrasing: "It was a…" constructions recur. No loops or major scaffolding; information density is adequate but leans expository in the lighthouse search.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong figurative language ("jagged, white vice," "hollow, resonant curiosity," "fold in patience") that charges the atmosphere. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the parasol-tip beat is vivid and concrete. However, several instances of filter-verb stacks ("He viewed," "He realized," "He walked") and slightly elevated diction ("ferrule," "acoustic signal") create minor distance in peak moments. The final paragraph risks over-explaining the thematic shift ("a promise that the end is simply a change in texture") where image alone might suffice. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is generally controlled ("cage of autumn light," "creature of grief"). Information density is high in the metaphor passage. However, several artifacts dull momentum: "his manner gently persuasive, coaxing her attention" is scaffold that paraphrases the prior action; "his motivation to nurture intersubjective understanding" imports jargon-register; "the metaphor sinking into the raw earth of her sorrow" stacks abstractions without concrete image. The paraphrase loop "by understanding the vines, she began to understand the man" and "she stepped into his subjective reality" restates the same idea across adjacent beats. Apply −0.6 for template/scaffold patterns and register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high with minimal padding. Clarity holds throughout. Minor overwriting in figurative clusters: "sleeping vipers," "blinding reality," "whisperfield calm" compressed into the opening; "grinding bone into the silica" is vivid but the metaphor density in early paragraphs slows momentum slightly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The confession and ritual beats are concise and propulsive. One filter stack: "knew that… was currently shifting… was designed to crush" in one sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym chains dull momentum: "disjointed spirit" / "lost its way," "delicate frequency of repair" / "transmute pain into a masterpiece." Template cadence appears in the middle ("He did not rush… Instead, his primary action was to linger… He had to stand…"). Stock metaphors ("iron skeletons," "graveyard of industry") reduce specificity. The long summary passage ("He stood there for hours") stalls propulsion at the piece's center, and overwriting in figurative density ("riot of purple blooms," "sculpture, a deliberate integration") appears in most sentences without pattern payoff. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("whisper peace"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong specific detail ("teardrop-shaped crystal," "chipped facets," "vaulted ceiling"). Sentence variety supports rhythm and key images land clearly ("The dictionary was a cage, and the moss was the key to the lock"). However, mild scaffold appears: "simple but dangerous," "strange but," "More importantly" are signpost transitions. The phrase "weathered innocence" recurs three times across the piece without sufficient reweighting between instances, trending toward motif-checklist territory. Information density is high in the testimony sequence but the opening paragraph front-loads exposition about the Great Silence and "the last dictionary" timeframe that could integrate more smoothly through action.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong imagery: "phantom gallery," "bleached by the sun and salt," "the collective sigh of a million captured moments." Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, action, or interiority. However, mild overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("tidal longing," "relentless gravity of a retreating ocean") and occasional elevated register ("esoteric but consuming," "the sheer weight of these suspended narratives") that slightly slows momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final paragraph's cadence shift charges the closure. Minor density concerns prevent entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density: "He was building a trap for a moment that refused to be caught" advances metaphor and plot simultaneously. Rhythm modulates well (short bursts during the screw adjustment, longer sentences during earthquake description). Minor loop: "The spinning hand..." recurs with slight variation ("whirred," "screamed," "blurred the air") across three paragraphs, creating textural consistency rather than redundancy. One scaffold slip: "It was a lesson his master had taught him" slightly externalizes rather than dramatizing the memory. Figurative language ("kinetic energy that sought escape velocity," "the sigh of gravity accepting a burden") remains coherent and physics-grounded without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is vivid and image-rich, but overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "the gray woolen blanket of the world's weather," "a thick quietude that throbbed with the unseen energy of a hundred final breaths," and "a golden acoustic warmth that seemed to physically knit the air together" stack metaphors without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening paragraphs ("Elias stood… The air within… As the resident…") with parallel sentence stems. Several lines loop: "the scent of hope" is named three times with synonym variations ("physical sensation," "overpowering," "grew stronger") that paraphrase rather than advance. Information density is high overall, but figurative density slows the final beat where clarity would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; every sentence advances setup or action. However, paraphrase loops appear: "quietly deliberate pace" / "quietly deliberate precision" / "quietly deliberate adjustment" churn the same phrase across three beats without added meaning. "Sealed awakenings" is repeated without functional variation. Figurative language is present but controlled—"twisted into impossible shapes," "tides against sand"—yet metaphors occasionally drift toward stock ("gnawed at her soul"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the grammar is clean. Information density is high, but the template cadence around "quietly deliberate" and scaffold repetition of motifs lower line-level tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but the piece suffers from overwriting in figurative density: nearly every sentence in the climax carries metaphor or elevated diction ("effigy," "glamour," "fissure," "nostalgic innovation," "shrewdly innocent," "splint for the family's sanity," "constellation"). Mixed metaphors appear: "cleft in certainty" is both fissure and joint, "bone setting" is both literal and metaphorical bridge. Template cadence surfaces in repeated "He [verb]" structures across the middle third. These artifacts dull immediacy and trigger the overwriting penalties, capping potential above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed success: "jagged maw of orange destruction" and "zephyr bloom" work, but "frosted fragments" and "pearl of stillness" layer metaphor without always advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "She was an earthbound star watcher... She spent her nights... She could not forget..." registers as repetitive stem phrasing (−0.4). Paraphrase loop: "opaque shard surrendered its dullness, becoming reflectively vibrant" restates transformation already shown in prior lines (−0.2). Information density is solid in the polishing sequence, but the opening two paragraphs front-load exposition. No major clarity breaks; sensory specifics ("salt-worn crust," "brass pan") ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high (each paragraph advances character, setting, or pressure). Minor paraphrase loop: "honeyed hush" recurs three times with slight synonym variation ("sticky quiet," "safe to inhabit"); −0.3 for near-redundancy. One filter-verb cluster in the Mara-discovery paragraph ("knew," "looked up") but not stacked densely enough to disallow 9+ globally. No scaffold or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening paragraph carries figurative language (ink bled, physics collided, swirling hush, crushing weight), creating density without corresponding propulsion. Mixed metaphors appear ("waded upstream through the thick, gelatinous flow" conflates liquid and solid). Template cadence is present in the second paragraph ("He stepped forward… He found… He raised… He did not want… He wanted… He needed"). Paraphrase loops occur ("he was a thief"/"a creator who destroyed"). Information density is high but rhythm drags under ornamental load. Deductions: density overload −0.6, template stems −0.5, mixed metaphor −0.3, paraphrase −0.2; total artifact penalty −1.6, capping near 5.4.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically varied; opening and closing images anchor voice and resonance. Information density is solid in the machine-work beats. However, paraphrase loops appear ("translate moonlight into nourishment" / "translate the raw lunar power into these intelligible, visual parables") and several lines restate concepts without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the climax: "The machine did not merely hum or shine; it revealed..." / "These silent, glowing narratives drifted..." / "He saw a child..." Sequential action clarity is strong, but elevated diction ("tableaux," "invocation," "communal reverence") occasionally stalls momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean and propulsive with high information density; most sentences advance ritual mechanics or atmosphere. Rhythm varies sentence length and structure without template cadence. One paraphrase loop: "creating patterns with discarded items" echoed in "These refusals of the earth were necessary anchors" within adjacent paragraphs, but the second adds causal function (−0.2). Figurative language is dense ("flash-paper alchemist," "skeletal geometry," "moving stillness") yet coherent and grounded in the alchemical frame. No scaffold sentences, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks that obscure. Opening and closing images anchor and recharge effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies and figurative language is purposeful in many lines ("vacuum for nostalgia," "inhaling lung"). However, density issues and scaffold appear: "He noted where the light lingered and where it fled, using these visual cues to map..." recaps the same observational work across adjacent clauses. Template cadence in paragraph three: "He adjusted... He was building... He tightened..." Stack of filter verbs in paragraph two ("He knew," "He needed," "He had to") flattens peak momentum. The prose is clear and grammatically clean, but the closure beat leans on abstract summary ("reduced to mere geology," "secured within the rational architecture") rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("shingled hush where layers of quiet overlapped like slate tiles"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character state, or plot. However, overwriting appears in several beats: "whalebone reverie, a profound, oceanic drifting" stacks near-synonym metaphors without pattern payoff, and the opening paragraph layers multiple conceits ("bronze grotto," "skeletal ribcage," "greening alloy," "roots of the pine forest...machinery of the earth") in rapid succession, creating mild register drift and slight opacity. The closure beat is clean, limiting the penalty, but mid-section density crosses into purple prose that slows momentum. Apply −0.6 for figurative density without payoff and mild coherence slip in metaphor vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character or atmosphere (kettle hum, wood grain, rain drumming). The opening and closing images bookend effectively. However, moderate overwriting appears in peak beats: "hauntingly practical soul," "crystallized time," and "rust-hued peace" read as elevated diction clusters that slightly obscure the POV's practical filter. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences at kettle scream). One paraphrase loop: paragraphs 2 and 3 both restate the "here and gone" concept without new pressure, warranting −0.2 under the loop check.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates at key beats ("*Click-click-whine.*"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor loop: "fractured stillness" appears twice in close proximity (paragraph 3 and final line) without reweighting. The phrase "a held breath waiting to exhale" is stock metaphor. Figurative density in the opening ("roiling expanse," "bruising twilight," "invisible platforms of hardened air") approaches algorithmic pattern without clear payoff in middle pressure. No grammar errors; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with purposeful technical specificity ("refractive index," "micro-turbine," "ionized"). Rhythm supports the moment: short beats during ignition, longer reflection at closure. However, paragraph three contains paraphrase loops ("The building still had a pulse; it was just buried") and scaffold phrasing ("He knew he could achieve ignition"). Template cadence appears in the setup ("he channeled…He treated…It was…"). These artifacts dull momentum slightly but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent ("viscosity," "glacial hush," "wet wound of ink"). Minor overwriting in the opening third: "mute passage of seconds," "cold preservation of reality," and "vestigial memory in his throat" stack elevated metaphors without pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("He moved…He was heading…") but does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold artifacts touch closure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the final line ("leaving his ghost behind to return to the clock") lands with clean propulsion. Strong overall, not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies well, and information density is high (each paragraph advances salvage or proof). Two artifact patterns lower the score: (a) Multiple abstract intensifiers front-load early paragraphs ("specific weight," "errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear"), creating a template cadence; (b) mild paraphrase loop between "The lies were architectural in nature, layered like bricks" and the rum/mortar/foundation metaphor two lines later. The closure beat itself is clean ("He released the winch brake, lowering the evidence"), so deductions remain non-closure. No loops touch the ending, but the early template stems and synonym churn prevent entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is textured ("rime-crusted hawser," "jagged, hollow tube of fulgurite glass"). However, figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting: "slow, grey tide," "ghost-like gentleness," "language of tension and friction," "premonition of a great thawing spring." Mixed metaphor appears in "oceanic hush...pressed against the ears like deep water"—hush is auditory, deep water is pressure—reducing clarity. Template cadence runs in the fourth paragraph: "He did not pull...Instead, he sought...whispering soft words...The fog was..." Paraphrase loop occurs between "philosophical seed collector" and "not the agricultural grain...but rather the dormant kernels," restating the same concept without added pressure. Aggregate artifacts in non-closure beats justify −1.0 cumulative deduction under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Line "The thread snapped with a dry sound, disproportionately loud in the stillness" exemplifies controlled specificity. Minor loop: "lonesome splendor" appears twice ("surrounded by the lonesome splendor," "The lonesome splendor of the house"), functioning as motif but risking template cadence. Elevated diction ("cartography of the soul's recovery," "amber of memory") is voice-consistent yet edges toward ornament in mid-beats without always advancing pressure. No egregious scaffold or filter stacks; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the assembly sequence. Clear propulsion through the egg fracture to chirp to realization. However, figurative language clusters densely without payoff: "kaleidoscope," "wept mineral tears," "quaking reverie," "tombstone of sterile metal" stack in the first third, creating textural drag before pressure mounts. Template cadence appears in the hypothesis beats: "If…then" structures repeat without variation. Paraphrase loop: "desperate motivation to reawaken beauty" and "beauty he had awakened was too fragile" restate the core conflict without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or major loops touch the closure beat, preserving the ending's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm is purposeful and varied, supporting the contemplative tone. Information density is high in the world-building (volcanic sand's dual memory, cedar branch's history). However, overwriting clusters in the opening: "massive, woolly armadas," "fractured piece of the night sky fallen to earth," and "undeniable weight of a firefighter" stack figurative language without pattern payoff. The phrase "core concept of unyielding compassion" reads as prompt-echo abstraction. Minor template cadence in the middle ("She knelt... placing... reached... began") and the phrase "a motivation to prove" feels scaffolded. The final image is strong, but earlier density occasionally obscures momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies well, and the prose is dense with layered imagery: "bruised purple," "luminous skeptic," "calcified plaque," "sidereal patience." Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. However, figurative language is heavy throughout—nearly every beat carries extended metaphor (memories as plaque, box as valve, patience as geological)—which risks overwriting in a piece this compressed. The phrase "adoption of sidereal patience" and "realistically imaginative" edge toward prompt-label territory. Minor paraphrase loop: "She understood that the universe operated on a clockwork" restates what the prior waiting passage has shown. No major artifacts or template cadence, but density could breathe more in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but density suffers from synonym loops and near-paraphrase: "beautiful but terrifyingly silent" / "absolute stillness created a troubling serenity"; "heavy, brass calculating machine gear" / "the heart of a parent that had stopped beating too soon" restates burden as metaphor without adding causal pressure. Template openings recur ("He had reached," "He had finally broken"). Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching, trending toward overwriting in the middle third. Clarity remains high, but propulsion lags under decorative load. Baseline artifact penalty −0.6 for loops and stem repetition; additional −0.3 for figurative saturation in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in most beats. However, several phrases lean toward overwriting: "loom of heavy ivy," "chamber of suspended amber," "thundering calm" (repeated), and "breathing rust" stack figurative language densely in the opening without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Two adjacent sentences in paragraph four essentially restate the mentorship method ("Halian closed his spectral eyes and projected a rhythm... The grandfather was teaching him that the meter of a poem mirrored the heartbeat of the bereaved")—a paraphrase loop that costs −0.2. Minor filter-verb reliance ("feeling," "realized") appears but does not obscure immediacy. The closing image is clean and propulsive, and no scaffolding or synonym churn mars the final third. Cumulative penalty ~−0.4 for figurative density in opening plus the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, but figurative language saturates peak beats: "mirror of his fractured soul," "curated the collective flow of moments," "iron heart," "wooden memory." Mixed metaphor: the coastline is both mirror and "sharp ridges" Silas's mind wanders in reverie—does the glass reflect or the ridges cut? "Saving grace finally began to emerge through tiny inscriptions" is vague; grace emerges, or does it transfer via vibration? Template cadence: "He waited... He reached out... He gripped... He had spent... He understood... He pressed..." stacks openers. Information density is high, but clarity wobbles under metaphor load.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong imagery ("velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes"). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent—"vertical mausoleum," "spectrum of grief," "wandering frequencies"—though "the strategic game of living" and "the real work of comprehension" read as slightly overwritten abstraction. Minor paraphrase loop: "decoding...to untangle...manipulating the loose strands, teasing them apart" restates the same action across multiple sentences without added pressure (−0.3). Template cadence in the final paragraph ("checked...reset...picked up") approaches boilerplate sequencing but remains functional. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with vivid images ("frozen lake sprawled like a shattered mirror," "kingfisher feather quill nib"). Information density is high in the opening third. However, the middle third loops conceptually: "boundaries of the unknown," "edges of human understanding," "blank spots on the cultural map" restate his profession without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the reflective passage ("He had to be...," "His vision had to be...," "His motivation was to..."). The final beat recovers momentum, but the loops and scaffold lower line-level propulsion. Deduction: −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor overwriting: "the detritus of the past, microscopic flecks of burned books and forgotten love letters suspended in the damp air like a memory fog" and "a physical manifestation of the narrative reclaiming its right to exist in a tangible form" both stretch figurative language in adjacent beats without a taught pattern. "Thistled calm" is fresh, but "memory fog" and "spiritual fire" cluster metaphorically. No loops or scaffolding, and the final line propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance ritual, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the destruction ("With a deep, powerful exhalation, he blows across the floor"). Minor scaffold appears: "Silas knows better, yet he possesses a gentle attribute" and "He does not tell her that preservation is a myth" are adjacent restatements of the same withholding. "The rhythmic crunch echoing" and "with a slow, deliberate motion" feel slightly generic. "The jagged porcelain hiding Silas's face protects him from her raw vulnerability, allowing him to witness" uses filter-verb stacking ("protects," "allowing," "witness") that flattens immediacy. Loop penalty and filter-verb cluster justify low 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentences carry high information density (most lines advance character, conflict, or atmosphere), and no loops or paraphrase artifacts are present. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("geological excavation of the recent past," "heartbeat of pure logic"). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from the immediate register in peak beats: "a subtle, rhythmic heresy" and "irritating, abrasive calm" feel slightly crafted rather than urgent. "Agonize" appears twice in quick succession, creating minor synonym proximity. These issues do not touch the closure beat but accumulate to −0.6 in Q7, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and many sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "The heavy curtains… drank the light… casting the room in… amber-hued dusk" fuses setting, tone, and atmosphere). However, template cadence appears in several places: "He looked down… He turned to face… He raised… He used… He urged…" clusters filter verbs and identical stems across the middle third, dulling immediacy (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "braiding" voices, "physics of empathy," "tide" of art—vehicles drift without coherent tenor (−0.3). One paraphrase loop: "suppress… chatter… fear… urge" and "subtracting noise… shuffling feet… nervous coughs… internal monologues" restate the same action across adjacent lines (−0.2). Information density is high elsewhere, and figurative language generally clarifies rather than obscures.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most sentences do multiple jobs). The pruning sequence ("Snip. He cut away...") uses fragment parallelism effectively for pressure. Minor template cadence in opening paragraph: "Elias wiped... Above... He looked down..." follows a consistent stem pattern across three beats without clear pattern-teaching. No major loops or scaffold; clarity remains high. Figurative language ("verdant geyser," "captured star") is vivid but occasionally dense in adjacent lines during the alignment peak.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Rhythm varies purposefully ("The sky was a bruised apricot" versus short exchanges). Minor loop: "the truth clawed at his teeth" and "the awful truth ringing" repeat the truth-compulsion motif without advancing it. Figurative density is high but mostly controlled ("nectar dusk," "amber light," "golden dragons"). One template cadence in the dialogue exchanges ("Kael blinked… Kael groaned… Kael froze") slightly flattens momentum. The final image recharges the dusk motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high, and most sentences advance atmosphere or concept. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "He needed to know what sparked the soul of a structure" restates the prior sentence's idea, and "The house seemed to react" followed by listing reactions (window rattle, groans) could compress. "Hushed blaze" appears three times, with the third use ("peaked, burning in his ears") adding intensity but risking decorative recurrence. The phrase "a fire burning without crackle or smoke that consumed the noise of living things" stacks metaphor without clear propulsion. Figurative density in the opening and middle paragraphs ("creeping normality noticer," "daydreaming streetlights," "calcified knot of scent") is high but remains legible; applying the overwriting check, density is elevated but does not obscure causality, warranting −0.5 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative beats ("It was murder") contrast with layered description ("stone figures stood frozen in mid-stride while sea fans waved frantically"). Information density is high—most lines advance setting, revelation, or character shift. However, synonym loops appear: "forgotten underwater city garden" echoes as "overgrown plaza," "crushing gloom of the abyss" / "crushing dark," and "wait out the apocalypse" / "waiting out the plague." The metaphor "hardened in her heart like a pearl around a grain of sand" is vivid but slightly over-extended under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; information density is high. Rhythm varies across paragraphs, though mid-story beats lean on template cadence: "He reached… He knew… He pulled… He defined… He finished… He stood… He shook." The opening and closing images are vivid. One paraphrase loop: "refusing to let… crush his spirit" echoes "grim optimist" without added pressure. Figurative language is purposeful ("monument to ascension," "trap disguised as a journey") but occasionally stacks ("hazy vertical abyss," "boundless confinement," "paradoxical architecture") in the opening beat. No major artifacts touch closure. Filter verbs ("knew," "saw") appear but remain voice-motivated. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is strong—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot—and rhythm varies purposefully (long descriptive sentences alternate with short beats at closure). However, several figurative phrases cluster in high-pressure moments: "blanket of gray amnesia," "borders of consciousness," "cold, ethereal fire," "ravine of concrete and steel" feel slightly overwritten without pattern-teaching. Two paraphrase loops: "the language of humanity was not yet entirely lost" echoes "strangers remember kindness" from earlier, and "saffron quiet" recurs three times without evolving meaning. The final image is clear, but the prose could tighten by 10% without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several phrases overwrite without pattern payoff: "weeping limestone walls," "rosewater dread," "displaced persons," and "rescued yeast... resurrected by warmth" stack metaphor and elevated diction in early exposition, slowing entry momentum. "A living thing against the rim of the bowl" and "calligrapher" precision work cleanly. The closure paragraph is lean and propulsive. Paraphrase appears once: "the impending noise was what Elian feared most" / "drown their auditory senses" restate the same threat. Cumulative overwriting in the first third and one paraphrase loop warrant deduction within the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in technical passages (gyroscope, latent radiance, clutch). Clarity is strong in spatial and mechanical description. However, figurative density in high-pressure beats—"singularity of brilliance that pulled at the air," "heavy burden of inevitability dissolving"—tips toward overwriting without pattern-teaching. Several phrases loop conceptually: "counter-clockwise" appears four times in similar constructions, and "store/storage" echoes within tight proximity. Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt the years lifting") and metaphoric convenience ("film reel spun in reverse") dull immediacy at the climax, triggering cumulative deductions in the −0.6 to −0.8 range.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the setup and mirror beats. Three craft issues lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop—"The lingering luminance of the mirror's surface flared a violent violet" closely echoes prior "lingering luminance" phrasing without added pressure. (2) Metaphor density in high-pressure beats (rot-smell, crystallized sugar, gullet, jagged stones, grinding metal, violent violet) accumulates without pattern-teaching, edging toward purple without opacity. (3) Stock phrase: "breaking its spine" at closure is a cliché that deflates the earned image of the inward-imploding mirror. Clarity and grammar are otherwise clean; no loops or scaffold mar causality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong imagery ("bruised plums," "vast, floating pipe organ"). However, density issues and minor loops appear: "The endless ocean breathed...inhaling...exhaling" restates the same idea; "restless euphony of whispers and creaks" recurs as "restless beauty." Template cadence: "She struck again, and then again, rapidly drawing..." followed by "Each strike of the mallet added..." The final paragraph stacks summary-like lines ("The trees stood tall...the salt washed...She touched..."). Figurative language occasionally crowds without adding pressure: "sketched resonance," "fractal generating," "bowed string against the cello" pile up in quick succession. Clarity remains high; no orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong specific nouns (scutes, barnacled flanks, silica dust). Rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language (sun "flayed" the city, atmosphere "heavy with sunwashed dread") is coherent and supports tone. Minor deductions: "terror that thrived in the total absence of shadow" in paragraph 13 is poetic but slightly abstract for a cartographer's POV under stress. One brief paraphrase loop: paragraphs 18–19 restate the convergence/singularity idea without adding new pressure. No Template cadence or filter-verb stacks detected.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with varied sentence rhythm and strong concrete images (ivy, cracked pillars, gold leaf shimmering). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or argument. However, minor scaffold persists: "She stepped onto the tracks, crushing the fallen petal beneath her boot, moving to recapture the narrative" uses participles to stack actions that could be tighter. "Look at this station," Elara said, gesturing to the vines choking the structural supports. / "You believe the ivy holds the roof up, just as you believe your lie sustains the peace." / She began drawing parallels, her voice steady..." shows template cadence (She [verb], pointing/gesturing/beginning) across three beats. One paraphrase loop: "forcing the Censor to look at the crumbling station not as a shelter, but as a warning" restates the ivy-as-false-support point already made. Apply −0.6 in Q7 for template cadence and loop, disallowing 9+ globally per the Text-Artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: "The iron chains groaned, hauling the drawbridge upward until it stood as a vertical barricade" packs action, result, and metaphor efficiently. Concrete detail (brass-bound inkwell, iron-gall ink mingling with brine, barnacles and silt) advances atmosphere and action simultaneously. Two minor issues: "stoically sensitive soul that vibrated with the silent grief" mixes metaphors (vibration versus silence), and the phrase "quiet, intense heat...hushed blaze of satisfaction" in the final paragraph loops conceptually (quiet/hushed, heat/blaze) without adding pressure. Figurative density in the closing lines ("emotional fossils," "soul of a displaced people") risks slight overwriting but remains legible and thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances setup or decryption. Rhythm modulates appropriately (short bursts during adjustment, longer clauses for revelation). Two clusters reduce score: "dappled" appears twice in close proximity for symbolic work rather than natural description, and "abruptly stripping," "darkness became...a physical weight," "tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve" stack elevated diction in the opening third without clear voice motivation from a "logical indexer." No loops or paraphrase; propulsion is strong. Figurative language ("darkness...a physical weight") is coherent but slightly dense for the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong figurative language: "light…scoured the eyes," "memories leaking…like iridescent mist," "sound like a breaking icicle." Rhythm varies and information density is high. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: "terrifying precision," "luminous torment," and stacked metaphors ("diving downward to fall upward, a bright spark sinking into the blue sky") risk slight muddle. No loops or scaffold detected. Figurative density in most sentences of the transformation sequence triggers −0.4 deduction within band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and conflict simultaneously. Rhythm accelerates during the perturbation sequence and slows for the collapse. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "He saw the timeline branch. / In the perturbation patterns, the wedding continued" could compress. The phrase "a man carved out of the negative space left by the sudden erasure" exhibits slight overwriting, and "intangibly tangible" in the required attribute creates a paradox that strains clarity. No major loops or template cadence, and the technical vocabulary remains precise throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong; no loops or paraphrase cycles detected. Information density is high, with most lines doing double duty (e.g., star-trail navigation establishes both method and thematic resonance). The "brilliant dimness" phrase recurs purposefully. Minor texture issues: "sharp-eyed drone pilot known for threading needles through collapsing skyscrapers" front-loads backstory in a way that feels slightly expository, and "a hunger that gnawed at her chest" is a common embodiment cliché. The extraction beat is clear and propulsive. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Strong images: "sieved hush," "bruised luminescence," "petrified oak." Minor loop: "He was not here to sell a lie, but to reclaim a stolen reality" followed shortly by "He had to focus" restates resolve without added pressure. Template cadence appears in two adjacent beats: "He dropped the wood…He knelt in the wet grit…He was looking for a remnant"—three He-verb stems that slightly flatten momentum. Figurative language is generally controlled, though "psychic refuse…manifested in timber and salt" edges toward overwriting. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity issues. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong propulsion and clarity with purposeful rhythm modulation. "Storm-worn and slick with the memory of a thousand torrential rains" and "mist was a living thing" edge toward density without muddle, but "furrowed hush" and "suffocating, furrowed hush" create minor repetition. The mechanism description integrates cleanly. Action sequence (jam drawer pull → gears catch → chains dissolve) unfolds with clear causality. Paragraph structure varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic patterns. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Clarity remains strong throughout. Two minor issues: "visceral, physical" is a near-synonym pair; "a smile...that was perfectly merrily melancholic" and then "a sad sort of happiness" paraphrase each other across adjacent lines (−0.3 for paraphrase loop). "Expectations collapse" as a noun phrase appears twice, creating slight echo. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The final image ("he was moving") is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong imagery ("sprawling expanse of black water ignited by millions of glowing blue algae"). Information density is high; sentences advance character and atmosphere. However, several phrases lean ornamental: "heavier than the sins Elias was trying to outrun" in the opening, "delicately robust" repeated for ball and timeline, "hot and jagged" for regret. The explanation "By sacrificing the proof of the miracle, he acknowledged the weight of the sin" summarizes rather than trusts the image. Minor scaffold: "It was supposed to be a cure" and "The procedure had tried to linearize his mind" tell efficiently but add slight drift. No loops or template cadence; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory density is high ("crystallized breath of a void-dragon," "bell-like tone that resonated through the marrow of the world"). Clarity holds through complex action. However, multiple filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats: "felt the heat," "felt the onset," "wanted to scream"; this dulls immediacy and triggers the filter-stack penalty (−0.5). Minor paraphrase loop: "The heat became a physical wall" followed by "the roaring wind of the bird's descent" restates pressure without added detail. Some figurative language is strained: "a sensory hook, cast into the sky to snag a god" mixes fishing and divinity awkwardly. Information density is strong but metaphoric coherence slips under ornamental weight in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual beats (ink pours, cards snap, images rise). However, purple overwriting pervades: "a choking beauty that pressed against the lungs," "crushing magnificence of the cosmos," "breathtaking and suffocating splendor" stack metaphors without adding pressure. The phrase "willingly discarded by a father who valued power over play" lands as moralizing summary rather than image. Paraphrase appears: "The time was not lost or stolen...but willingly discarded" recaps what the prior sentence showed. Template cadence in the opening ("The atmosphere...was a physical weight, a choking beauty...") front-loads modifiers. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (the climax) triggers −0.5; closure beat summary adds −0.3. No loops or major artifacts beyond those noted.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but several patterns create minor drag. "He had to integrate the darkness he had spent a lifetime repressing" is followed closely by restating the same idea in "acknowledge that the capacity for evil was necessary to give meaning to the choice of good"—a paraphrase loop. "Ghostly resolve" in the final line echoes the opening's tonal setup without adding new information. Stock phrases appear: "final witness," "species that had already resigned itself to dust," "raw, unfiltered emotion." The stitching sequence—"pierced the metaphysical space where his physical heel met...silhouette"—is dense but legible; however, the mixed metaphor of "solidified moonlight" for a tear slightly muddles the gem's nature. No line-level opacity blocks causality, and the prose generally serves pressure without scaffold stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Clarity is high, no loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is dense ("the sky bruised purple," "breath held in anticipation of a scream") and mostly coherent, but stacks in the opening third without clear payoff until the climax. "Vibrant hush" and "whispering hush" are used interchangeably without distinction. The phrase "orchestrates coincidences with the precision of a master jeweler" intrudes with register drift. Information density is strong; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is technically clean with varied syntax and vivid images (photoreactive compound, ghost veins on marble, metallic sigh of the bronze lock). Information density is high in the sundial-unlocking beat. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure moments: "liquid grace of a dancer stepping onto a darkened stage," "the atmosphere...shifted, adopting a tone of winking hush, as if the statues themselves were leaning in." Mixed metaphor: the fort as both "lantern of secrets" and previously a "cage of light"—the vehicle logic blurs. The final paragraph stacks metaphor and summary ("frequency had changed," "liberation," "lantern of secrets," "only key") rather than propelling through image alone. Template cadence in the opening: "While the other guards...Elara stood...As the vigilant lock sentinel...she turned...Her demeanor was..." Apply −0.6 for figurative density and metaphor muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. However, several metaphors cluster without pattern-teaching: "glistening, terrifying slide," "relentless cinema," "borrowed dawn," "singular, breathless moment" in quick succession. "Collapsed star dust" and "neutronium" are used interchangeably without clarity on whether they're synonyms. One paraphrase loop: "The friction of opposing forces created a localized pocket of stability" immediately followed by "weeping...from the sensation of his knees gripping the ground without slipping"—same content restated. Template cadence appears in the setup paragraph: "He reached...He arranged...He withdrew...He carefully set," four consecutive "He [verb]" openings. No grammar errors; clarity remains high despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("violently bruised ocean," "rejected god," "ghost through the paper," "fresh wounds reopening"). Clarity holds and no paraphrase loops appear. Overwriting penalty: metaphoric density appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching, and some vehicles mix registers ("dangerous resonance," "ghost through," "barometric trench," "marrying the smell") in ways that occasionally blur rather than sharpen. "Storm-kissed wonder" in the penultimate paragraph and "washed it clean" in the final line are stock poetic gestures that dull the closure image's specificity. Apply −0.5 for density without payoff and −0.3 for figurative muddle touching the closure beat, total −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm supports pressure (short beats during blade exchanges, longer during cipher work). "Dignified chaos," "diplomatically fierce," and "ozone and epiphany" show elevated register that occasionally tips toward purple without harming clarity. One paraphrase loop: "the waiting was over" echoes "technically waiting" from the opening without added pressure. Figurative density is high but coherent (no mixed metaphors). Information density is strong; most lines advance plot or atmosphere. Minor scaffold ("It was a scene of…") and one filter-verb stack ("believed," "needed") in the exposition paragraph lower the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the final beats where short declarations ("It is done." "No...It is beginning.") create cadence shift. However, runs of elevated diction without pattern-teaching appear in high-pressure moments: "the attribute that defined his chaotic existence," "the very engine of their survival," "the core concept of their rebellion" stack abstract labels mid-beat. Minor paraphrase loop: "to forge beauty from anarchy" is restated as "gardens in the gutters and poems on the pavement" without added pressure. Stock metaphors: "snake sloughing dry scales," "invincible certainty of spring." Information density is high; no major scaffolding loops. Figurative density in the final third (rust into veins of silver, glass into diamonds, cracks as veins) borders on overwriting but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language ("bruised purple," "cone of light," "sea of vapor") is vivid without stacking. Information density is high, with most lines advancing setting, concept, or action. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "He had found his sanctuary" followed immediately by "pocket dimension...sustainable only as long as the projector's bulb held" restates the finite grace idea without added pressure (−0.2). The phrase "strategically creative, repurposing the obsolete technology" reads slightly template-like, and "steely longing that anchored him" functions as a hybrid tell/label rather than fully embodied perception. The final image lands cleanly with no artifacts. Grammar and punctuation are clean, and the opening and closing lines are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening/closing images anchor well. Information density is generally high, with most lines advancing plot or atmosphere. However, multiple issues accumulate: (1) Paraphrase loops—"luminous doubt" reappears as "radiant skepticism," "glowing uncertainty"; "harsh, waking rock" → "barren peak" → "unforgiving granite" within tight proximity. (2) Elevated diction pervades high-pressure beats: "empirically whimsical," "dormant potentiality," "archaic syntax," "ambient magic," "glittering chaff," which drifts from the POV's urgent register. (3) Stock metaphor: "like a bullet" for raindrop. (4) Minor simultaneity issue: "closing his eyes to listen…The ridge projected a vision" implies overlapping perception modes without clear sequencing. Accumulation of artifacts (loops + register drift + stock image) totals approximately −1.2 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack; none directly obscure causality but they dull momentum in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but coherent ("cerulean regret," "motion that was rhythmically placid"). Information density is high; most lines advance ritual or atmosphere. However, several phrase templates recur: "The [noun] was [descriptor]" appears in quick succession (atmosphere, lace, reaction), creating mild cadence monotony. "Rhythmically placid" is used twice in close proximity without transformation. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 10–11 restate the tide's gentle motion without added pressure. No major artifacts touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies (−0.8 for template stems and loop, routing here per the penalty-routing rule).

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally precise, rhythmically varied, and dense without tipping fully into purple; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Images like “topography of loss” and scales “like a distant nebula” are strong and coherent. There is some figurative saturation and conceptual reiteration (entropy/decay framed in multiple similar ways) that could be trimmed for even tighter momentum. Line-level clarity and cadence at the ending remain intact and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and for the most part high information density—many lines do double duty for atmosphere, character, and theme (“The earth was remembering the violation of the smugglers' passage”). Metaphors are largely coherent and character-specific, though there is some tendency toward abstraction and conceptual repetition around “purpose,” “stillness,” and “pauses.” Momentum holds despite reflective passages because these reflections are anchored in immediate sensory cues and lead to tactical choices. Minor hints of purple prose do not significantly obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“a silent shout of life that pushed back the conservatory’s gray gloom”). Metaphors and imagery are largely coherent and apt, though there is some stacking of figurative language (ocean, music, heat, color) that edges toward density without quite tipping into purple. Redundancy and scaffold are minimal; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or situation. The final image is clear and strong, not dulled by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally concise yet layered, often doing double duty (atmosphere plus character or concept), and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Metaphors are vivid and mostly coherent with the world (“whale dying in a cathedral,” “water and memory”), and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. At times the figurative language piles up—several elaborate images in close succession—nudging the edge of overwriting and slightly dulling impact. Still, momentum is not significantly harmed, and line-level clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied, and generally dense with information, often doing double duty (world-building plus emotion, or theme plus action). Recurring motifs of silence, weight, and wind are handled with control rather than purple excess. There is some explanatory scaffolding that could be tightened (“Her primary motivation was…”), but it doesn’t meaningfully drag momentum or obscure causality. The piece falls short of the very top band because it rarely surprises at the sentence level with truly arresting or compressed turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush yet controlled: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character simultaneously) without collapsing into muddle, and the rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous description and tighter, action-focused lines. Key images—black thorns curling inward, breath altering condensation, the ghost dissolving into motes—are clear and striking. There is a mild tendency to favor ornate phrasing and abstract nouns, but it rarely stalls momentum or obscures sense. A bit more line-level pruning could heighten impact, but as-is it is publishable in a demanding venue.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is highly polished, with controlled rhythm, varied sentence structure, and dense but generally coherent imagery. There is some tendency toward piling modifiers and big metaphors (“flat, colorless torment of nostalgia and regret,” “two-dimensional prisons robbed him of the world’s depth”) that risk slight redundancy and purple shading, but they don’t obscure action or causality. Overall, the prose carries atmosphere and momentum effectively while maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and controlled, with concrete images like “oxidized brass skeleton keys” and “stiff, dried stalks of ancient grain woven with intricate care” doing multiple jobs. Sentences generally avoid redundancy and maintain momentum despite a descriptive density. There are a few moments of near-purple abstraction (“plant resilience in dry soil,” “organic circuit”) but they don’t seriously cloud clarity or undercut the climax. Overall, this reads as refined, publication-ready prose with only minor tendencies toward overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for world-building and mood. Figurative language is frequent but usually apt (“bruised lung,” “compressed dust of burned archives”), and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. At times the density of metaphor flirts with purple prose, but it doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image. Overall, momentum is maintained and the final lines land with clarity and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, and there’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic template drift. A few metaphors verge on ornamental rather than necessary, which slightly softens momentum in a couple of spots. Still, clarity and propulsion remain strong, with no artifacts harming the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: images like the furnace as a “defiant orange beast” and the final dome as a “transparent eye” are vivid and purposeful, not decorative. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, balancing lyricism with clarity; there are no real loops or scaffolding phrases that stall momentum. Metaphors (thawing heart, weighty lightness) are consistent and extended with care rather than piled incoherently. The density of figurative language skirts but does not cross into purple; an elite journal might trim one or two flourishes, but not for structural reasons.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly efficient, vivid, and multi-functional, and the prose carries momentum through a dense premise. Imagery like “high-frequency radar” for panic and the pen-tip indentations on plaster are concrete and effective. There is some tendency toward stacked modifiers and conceptual phrasing (“transformative betrayal,” “every conceivable terror”) that edges toward purple, but clarity and propulsion remain intact. No serious loops or artifacts undercut the climax or closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly precise and information-dense, with metaphor doing real conceptual work (e.g., gold leaf degradation mirroring collapsing galaxies). There’s a clear sense of progression and momentum despite the meditative mode, and redundancy is minimal given the accumulative design. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, especially around silence and hush, which risks a touch of purple and softens impact through saturation. Trimming or varying a few metaphors would sharpen the peak beats without losing the lush texture.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and rarely redundant, with many doing double-duty for worldbuilding and mood (“the air tasted of ozone and regret” is emblematic). Figurative language is frequent but generally clean and coherent; the one or two more elaborate constructions (“emotional thermal drop”) remain legible and in-character. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or rhythmically mechanical stretches, and syntax remains clear during the key consolidation beat. The prose is a touch lush for such a quiet conflict, but momentum never truly stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and generally high information density—most lines carry worldbuilding, mood, and emotional stakes at once. Metaphors tend to be coherent and apt (e.g., mistrust thawing like rainwater), and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases flirt with mild purple or abstraction (“ambiguously clear ache,” “sterilized it into efficient data packets”), but they don’t obscure meaning or momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive markets, though not quite at the rare, razor-edited level.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and image-rich but generally avoids tipping into muddled or self-indulgent metaphor; “blooming withering” and the cracked marbles are memorable, coherent images. Sentences frequently do double duty, advancing atmosphere and theme while moving the scene forward, and there is little sense of paraphrase or scaffold. A few phrases (“metric of fortune,” “mended deception did its work”) flirt with abstraction but remain legible within the established register. Overall, momentum is preserved despite the lyricism, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: images like “a bruise of indigo and violet” and “stepped laterally, moving perpendicular to the station’s reality” are striking yet precise. Sentences generally do more than one job, advancing setting, concept, and emotion together, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is sustained without devolving into muddle or mixed metaphors, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. A few phrases approach purple, but they don’t impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically aware, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and action. The figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, with only occasional risks of purple prose that don’t significantly blur sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; each line generally advances mood, situation, or character. The density of metaphor in some passages (“sunken cathedral of sound,” “wordless conversation”) mildly slows momentum but doesn’t obscure the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, tone, and character simultaneously. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. However, the frequency of figurative language flirts with purple in places (“auroral sorrow,” “swaying certainties”), risking slight saturation in such a brief piece. Line-level craft is strong enough for a top venue, but a subtle trim of ornament would make it razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and character) with few redundancies, and rhythm varies between longer, lush descriptions and tighter, charged lines. Figurative language is generally apt and not over-stacked, with standout images like the condensation as “cold sweat” and the silence pressing with “phantom roar.” There are very minor moments of conceptual repetition (“weight of a swallowed truth” echoed explicitly), but they don’t stall momentum. Syntax is clear, grammatical, and propulsive, supporting rather than obscuring the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, frequently doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“The vines had long ago decided that the books were merely trelliswork…”). Figurative language is rich but mostly disciplined; metaphors extend rather than conflict, and there’s little paraphrase looping. The compression/expansion beat as she enters the swan is particularly well-rendered and legible despite its abstraction. A touch of purple in isolated phrases is the only thing keeping this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and dense with information, and most sentences pull double duty (setting plus mood, action plus interiority). Some lines edge toward abstraction or repetition—for instance, the explanatory paragraph about ordinary magic and the “period beneath the hush of dreaming roots”—which slows momentum slightly. Imagery remains coherent; metaphors (water filling a cup, nature holding its breath) are conventional but apt rather than mixed. Trimming a few explanatory clauses would sharpen propulsion, but there are no serious artifacts or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-dense without collapsing into incoherence; metaphors generally align and carry thematic weight. Sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum, and most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and meaning). There is some purple-leaning phrasing and conceptual redundancy, but it doesn’t significantly obscure action or closure. With very slight tightening, this would be publication-ready at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence structures, generally high information density, and figurative language that usually pulls its weight (“the silence was loudest,” dust igniting like microscopic stars). The prose occasionally edges toward purple or conceptual (“minor scale of paranoia to a major chord of resolution”), but the metaphors are internally coherent and on-theme. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and action sequences around the lens and levers read clearly. The stylistic flourish is noticeable but not yet so disciplined or surprising as to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, action) and the rhythm shifts effectively with the pressure of the ritual. Figurative language is mostly precise and consonant with the audio/void motif, and there’s little waste or explanatory scaffolding. Some metaphors (“terrifying, muffled clarity,” “audio landscape became a complex, swirling architecture of grammar and negation”) flirt with density but stop short of muddling clarity. There are no evident loops, template cadences, or technical slips that dull the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and psyche, and there is minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and apt (“the frozen lake stretched out like a paused breath”), with few strained or mixed metaphors. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum, and crucial beats are rendered with clarity despite the lyric density. Slight trimming of modifiers and metaphor frequency in the climactic paragraph could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, generally doing multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly cohesive and legible; the central metaphors of light, stone, and fracture are maintained rather than scattered. There is minor risk of overload (“darkening brightness,” “burning white sky,” “luminescent vapor”) that could be streamlined for even sharper impact, but momentum and clarity survive. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to keep the ear engaged, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme) with good momentum and minimal scaffolding. Metaphors are striking yet coherent (e.g., “filament of hush,” “crescendos undoing themselves”), and syntactic variation prevents monotony. There is a mild density of figurative language that occasionally flirts with over-richness, but it doesn’t blur causality or dull the closure image. I see little redundancy or template cadence, and the final paragraphs land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, concrete verbs, and purposeful description that usually advances both mood and action. The prose rarely loops or pads; most lines carry at least two functions (tone plus plot, or character plus setting). A few phrases are slightly abstract or expository (“possessed of a scientific mind,” “to nurture integrity in solitude”), but the overall rhythm and clarity remain high without tipping into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, often doing multiple jobs per sentence—advancing action, worldbuilding, and mood simultaneously. Metaphors are generally coherent and aligned (glass, crystal, light, dust, bruising color), and rhythm varies well across paragraphs. At times the language edges toward purple (“tears so violent they felt like physical hemorrhages,” “deep, bruising purple light”), which slightly threatens to over-saturate high-pressure moments without adding proportional insight. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing dual duty for atmosphere and character, and very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, and the syntax varies enough to sustain momentum through the build and crisis. Key beats—the smoking rope, the tactile contact with time, the final renunciation—are rendered clearly without muddled metaphors or over-explanation. There is some risk of ornament density in places, but it does not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is generally excellent: dense, multi-tasking sentences with vivid metaphors that mostly remain coherent and grounded (“the body of a great, transparent cello,” “tears cutting clean tracks through the soot”). There’s little outright redundancy or scaffold, and the prose sustains momentum despite its richness. A few phrases (“fragile lung preserving the last breath of a drowned world,” “magnificent simplicity”) flirt with purple or abstraction but don’t significantly blur sense or closure. Slight tightening—especially of stacked modifiers—would be required for truly top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally strong, with a good ear for rhythm and layered sentences that often do double duty for mood and information. Metaphoric texture (“honeyed gloom,” “spiritual autopsies,” “fabricated nostalgia”) is vivid and on-theme, and clarity is preserved throughout. That said, there are moments of density and near-redundancy where stacked descriptors risk purple-prose territory, especially around the scent’s effect. Trimming a few intensifiers and abstractions would sharpen momentum and let the best images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, clear, and dense with information, and there are few if any outright redundancies or mechanical errors. Many images are well-shaped (“ocean wind plucked at the pages,” “radiant enough to rival the constellations”), and exposition is compact. There is some purple tendency and stacking of conceptual language (cycles of compassion, cosmic ledger, currency metaphors) that can feel slightly on-the-nose or decorative rather than necessary. Trimming a few abstractions and leaning even more on concrete action and image would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush yet largely precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“a beautiful, glowing sadness that seemed to vibrate in the very marrow of her bones”). Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and tonally unified, avoiding mixed metaphors or obvious redundancy. Momentum holds: even descriptive passages lead into actions or decisions, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. It skirts purple at moments, but not enough to blunt the closure image or obscure cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and stakes) without bloating, and the figurative language is coherent with the setting (canals as blood, echoes as smoke, time as something sculpted). There’s little to no paraphrase looping or filler scaffolding; momentum is well-maintained despite lyricism. A few lines edge toward purple but stay intelligible and anchored in concrete images (e.g., water droplets as diamonds, wind as a solid wall). Line-level craft robustly supports, rather than obscures, the story’s pressure and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Phrases like “mineral tears wept into the soil” and “gelatinous uncertainty” are vivid without becoming incoherent, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn. A few lines flirt with redundancy or overpacking (“via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone,” reasserting what we already know), which slightly slows momentum in places. Overall, though, clarity and propulsion are maintained, and figurative language rarely muddies sense.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors are both fresh and coherent with the world (“hollow-boned fossils,” “dawn ghosts”). The lyrical density occasionally borders on lush, but it rarely muddies action or causality, and momentum generally holds. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; each paragraph meaningfully advances mood, plot, or character. A touch of purple in cumulative effect keeps it just short of absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without major clutter, and rhythm supports the rising pressure. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme (cellulose vs. bone, xylem in veins), with few if any mixed metaphors. There is a mild tendency toward purple prose and density (“hyper-saturated atmosphere,” “intrusive xylem”) that a high-end editor would likely trim for tautness. No genuine artifacts or loops blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Figurative language (“fossilized sunlight,” “ribs of an ancient subway tunnel”) is vivid yet controlled, rarely feeling indulgent or muddled. There’s no noticeable scaffolding, synonym churn, or template cadence dragging momentum, and the final image is clean and sharp. Only occasional high-stacked imagery edges toward purple, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, dense with meaning, and mostly free of loops or scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, concept, or character. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and aligned with the setting and theme. There are moments of slight purple or over-explaining (“concentration of the ambient wonder that permeated the world unnoticed”) that could be pared without loss. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for serious venues, just shy of the razor-honed compression seen at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character) with few redundancies, and the prose mostly balances lyricism with clarity. Figurative language ("bruised purple sky," "navigated absences") is vivid and coherent, and the action around the valve and horn mechanism remains easy to follow. There is some mild register drift into essayish abstraction and a density of conceptual metaphors that, while not confusing, occasionally distance us from immediacy. Even so, rhythm, syntax variety, and precision are high, with no serious loops or muddle near the close.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rich and mostly disciplined: layered metaphors and images do double-duty for atmosphere and psychology without slipping into incoherence. Sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; there are no loops that sap momentum. A few moments skirt purple (“cavernous expanse defined only by constellations of cold light”) but remain intelligible and aligned with tone. The line declaring her mapping a “defense mechanism” is the most prosaically expository phrase in an otherwise image-driven piece.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lucid and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“music felt in the marrow rather than heard by the ear”). Information density is high and there’s little wasted scaffolding. A few lines veer toward abstraction or slightly purple conceptual phrasing, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in rhythm, imagery often does double duty (worldbuilding plus mood), and momentum carries cleanly from setup to rupture to dissolution. Some metaphors are dense and frequent, but they are mostly controlled and not contradictory; the accumulation supports the cosmic, pressurized atmosphere rather than obscuring causality. There are minor redundancies (reiterating the “hushed thunder” sensation, multiple phrasings of spatial instability) that could be tightened for maximum impact. Overall, the prose is vivid and propulsive but just shy of the razor precision expected at top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and vivid, with strong images like the ink pot “smelled faintly of ozone and old regrets” and the rejection form slapped onto “wet steel.” Most sentences do double duty, advancing mood and situation simultaneously, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. There is some tendency toward stacked metaphors and abstract phrasing (“frantic pulse of life hiding in the shadow of the grave,” “fortress of his logic”), which edge into purple but stop short of obscuring clarity. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though a slight paring back of the most self-conscious flourishes would sharpen the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-appropriate, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright purple excess. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, process, or stakes. A slightly heavy reliance on ornate phrasing in places may be a touch rich for some venues, but it does not blur sense or weaken the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and mostly precise, with vivid metaphors that rarely feel strained and a good balance between rhythm and clarity. Information is well layered; nearly every sentence advances either atmosphere, character, or concept, and there is little obvious scaffold or paraphrase looping. A few lines edge toward purple (e.g., “a fluctuating canyon of red and blue metal”) but remain anchored in concrete imagery, and the figurative density never seriously muddies sense or closure. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready with only light tightening possible for concision.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, theme) with relatively little scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm varies well. Imagery—like the collapsing sky as “slurry of grey static” and the observatory walls folding inward—feels precise and thematically apt. There is some density of metaphor, but it rarely becomes muddled or mixed, and clarity of action/moment never collapses. A touch of abstract phrasing around Elias’s psychology prevents this from entering the very top tier, but momentum holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with good rhythmic variation and an impressive density of concrete images. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent; phrases like “fortress of confusion” and “constellations of neon lights” work with the tone. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or clotted metaphors, and grammar and sequencing stay clean. A slight trimming of stacked modifiers in a couple of spots could make key beats (like inserting the stone) land even more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, concise for its density, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language (“teeth-ache in his bones,” “dawnlit melancholy,” “violence of illumination”) is vivid and controlled, not overstacked to the point of muddle. Syntax and paragraphing create good momentum heading into the climax and a graceful deceleration at the end. A few clusters of modifiers flirt with lushness, but they do not impede clarity or pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, character, mood) without redundancy, and rhythm varies well. Figurative language (“as if it contained a beating heart,” “vibrated with a deep, rhythmic thrumming”) is apt and not over-stacked, even in high-pressure beats. There are no obvious loops, syntactic tics, or clarity issues, and technical terms (laminar flow, gyroscope, sensor array) are integrated smoothly. A slight tendency toward lush modifiers keeps it out of the very top band but does not materially slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with strong rhythm and metaphorical control; images like “the heavy, suspended breath of a predator” and the condensation forming an impossible map are memorable and precise. Most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing scene, character, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or muddled, and syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged. A minor risk is that the high density of metaphor slightly cushions urgency, but it doesn’t obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally tight: most sentences carry multiple loads (world, mood, and stakes) and avoid redundancy. Imagery such as the tuning fork drinking discord and the archway’s groan/hum system is vivid and coherent. There’s some density of metaphor, but it remains consistent with the story’s logic and doesn’t tip into purple or mixed imagery. The final sentences land cleanly without scaffolding or explanatory padding.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and action. A few phrases lean toward familiar or slightly overwrought imagery (“fear clawing at her throat,” “black edges of hypoxia”), and the overall saturation of figurative language is high, but it seldom muddies sense. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and the final lines land cleanly without figurative confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphorical language is generally precise, and most lines perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and psychology). The figurative density is high but usually controlled; phrases like “a heavy, metallic stillness that felt like copperlight repose” or “door…of neglected space and forgotten intentions” are vivid rather than muddled. There is little scaffold or repetition, and the final image lands clearly. Occasionally the prose edges toward purple, which slightly dampens momentum, but it does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and vivid figurative language that advances mood and world-building rather than padding. Sentences vary in length and structure, and the narrative remains clear even when the imagery is lush. There are a few borderline purple clusters (“feverish, verdant containment,” “heartbreaking joy that celebrated his survival while grieving the absolute loss”) but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure. No significant loops, scaffolding, or technical errors interfere with momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, metaphors are mostly coherent and purposeful, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundant phrasing. Imagery such as “the architecture acted as a tidal clock, breathing in the sea” and “turning the open air between the ledges into a suspended floor of silver and stone” does multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and thematic echo. While the prose edges lush, it avoids true purple excess and maintains clarity of action through the acrobatics sequence. Momentum is sustained across paragraphs without noticeable loops or filler.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet generally precise, with many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and psychology (“treating the subterranean space less like a gravesite and more like a dormant library”). Rhythm varies well across longer, meditative lines and shorter, decisive beats, giving the climax (the shadow aligning, her touch on the stone) a clear cadence shift. There is occasional redundancy and borderline purple phrasing, but it seldom obscures meaning or momentum. Figurative language stays coherent to the established botanical/temporal palette, avoiding mixed metaphors in crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and a high density of purposeful imagery; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or theme plus character). The prose sustains clarity despite its lyricism, and there are no significant loops, redundancies, or mechanical errors. At times the figurative load veers toward purple (“atmosphere dripped with a distinct sense of futuristic nostalgia”) and occasionally tells what the images already imply, which slightly dulls impact. Still, momentum and intelligibility are maintained, and the closing sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythm, high information density, and evocative metaphors that usually remain coherent and purposeful. The opening and closing paragraphs are particularly strong in their sonic and imagistic control. There is occasional tendency toward lushness (e.g., “quantum foam where choices branched like capillaries”) but it stops short of purple prose and doesn’t stall momentum. No significant loops, scaffolding, or line-level artifacts blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without unnecessary scaffold, and rhythm varies well between lush description and tighter action. Figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent, though a few abstractions (“space where an apology waits unspoken,” “suspended reality built from the debris of your pride”) tilt toward purple and slightly over-expository metaphor. There are no significant loops, clarity issues, or grammatical slips, and the final images land cleanly. Trimming 5–10% of the most ornate metaphors would lift momentum into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong, with a high density of images that mostly carry their weight—the heart/grenade drawing, the coral as neural maze, the mist as blanket are precise and apt. There is some drift toward purple prose and explicit thematizing (“symbolically cleansing the memory,” “un-knotted the narrative of the war”) where implication would suffice. Sentences generally do double duty (image plus psychology), and there’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn, though a few conceptual restatements could be trimmed. Rhythm and clarity remain intact through the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly tight, varied, and multi-functional, and there is minimal redundancy. Some metaphors and modifiers (e.g., “cathedral of light,” “beautiful futility,” “organic database”) flirt with purple or on-the-nose abstraction but do not muddle clarity. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to stall momentum. The final image is clean and legible, with no major artifacts or loops dulling its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense: images like “colors were not pigment but vibrations” and “the universe was not a puzzle to be solved, but a song to be heard” carry thematic and sensory weight simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled, with few mixed metaphors or redundancies, and sentence structures vary enough to maintain flow. There is very little scaffolding or paraphrase; nearly every line advances mood, world, or idea. A few adjective stacks (“vivid thrumming of indigo and violent scarlet”) verge on purple, but they don’t materially drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“a sound that was felt rather than heard,” “frequency of pure, unadulterated nonsense”) is vivid yet largely controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Action remains clear even as reality warps; readers can follow cause, effect, and spatial relations within the greenhouse. The brief expository paragraph about flower-code resistance is the only spot where momentum dips slightly, but it still carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and thematic echo) while maintaining clarity. Metaphor density is high, but vehicles are coherent and support the aquatic/cosmic/garden palette instead of clashing. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; progression feels efficient for such lush prose. I’m holding it just below the top band because the near-constant figurative language flirts with purple in places and could benefit from a few more plain, sharp sentences to vary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is dense yet disciplined: metaphors extend logically from the world’s premises, and most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and stakes) without padding. There are no evident synonym loops or scaffold phrases; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or situation. The diction occasionally flirts with purple, but the internal consistency of the imagery (glass, sound, air, light) prevents muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, with clear syntax and well-managed paragraphing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with high information density and imagery that often does double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“aggressive honesty,” “liquefied essence of Veritas Aeterna”). Sentences vary in length and structure, and there is little obvious scaffolding or redundant paraphrase. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally lush, sometimes bordering on excess but rarely confusing the action or emotional throughline. A touch more restraint in metaphor density at peak beats would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally clean, and information-dense, with mechanical, emotional, and atmospheric work often carried in one line. Some metaphors and modifiers stack (“dappled resolve,” “slyly heartfelt precision,” multiple “resonant” or “grinding” sounds), skirting purple but rarely obscuring sense. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances mood, world, or stakes. A slight trimming of adjectival load in peak moments would sharpen propulsion and raise this to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Some metaphors and constructions edge toward purple or awkward abstraction (“blooming withering,” “timeframe across learning to trust again”), but they do not significantly impede clarity or momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned rather than showy for its own sake. There are no major loops or scaffolding repetitions; the prose carries the scene smoothly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, layered (often doing atmosphere, worldbuilding, and theme at once), and rhythmically varied, with few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (shards, prisms, grain, nerves), and the final thud of the logbook followed by the intentional step back lands with clarity. A few moments edge toward purple (“jagged shards of quiet,” “featherly determined,” “single, screaming nerve”), creating slight density bloat but not enough to obscure meaning or momentum. Overall, information density and propulsion are high for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and generally precise imagery that carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). A few metaphors verge on purple (“mechanism of their connection was simple, grounded not in words but in a physical reaction”) and there are occasional stacked images, but they rarely confuse. The prose sustains momentum and clarity through the climax, with no major loops or scaffolding. Tightening one or two over-rich lines would bring it to a truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and coherent, and the density is high without fully tipping into self-indulgent purple. Momentum holds through description, with clear action order and clean mechanics. A slight tendency toward ornament for its own sake in a few metaphors is the only real brake on an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, mood) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm varies effectively. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and grounded, avoiding mixed metaphors or serious purple-prose muddle. Information is clear and causality easy to follow, even in the more syntactically elaborate lines. There is mild density inflation in places, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntax is varied, and many images (“fledge…like the sprouting wings of a mythical creature,” “spectrum of memory”) do double thematic and atmospheric work. There is some redundancy and intensifier stacking—phrases like “obsidian grace,” “twilight garden under stars,” and multiple cosmic adjectives recur enough to feel slightly overworked. The prose leans ornate but remains coherent, without loops or major muddle at the climax. Tightening 10–15% of modifiers would bring it closer to elite-magazine polish.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) and flow with good rhythm. There is some density of figurative and abstract language, but metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than mixed. A few sentences feel redundant or explanatory (“The tone of the moment was one of clear complexity”; reiterating motivations already dramatized), and occasional phrasing is slightly purple. These are polish-level issues; they slow momentum a bit but do not obscure clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, rhythm varies, and most metaphors cohere and reinforce the central motifs. Information density is high and many lines do double duty (character + theme, or setting + emotion). However, there is noticeable metaphor stacking and occasional overwriting (“the slow dance of celestial bodies,” “enlightening the void”) that could be pared for sharper impact, and a few explanatory sentences paraphrase what images already imply. None of these issues significantly obscure sense or dull the closure image, but they keep it shy of top-tier tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: images are imaginative, language is precise, and most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, atmosphere) without obvious padding. The figurative density is high but mostly controlled, with motifs (geometry, pressure, light, grayness) returning rather than piling up arbitrarily. A few formulations flirt with purple prose or near-redundancy (“ozone and electromagnetic static,” “spiritual stagnation,” “the atmospheric pressure of destiny”), but they remain legible and don’t obscure the action or closure. Overall momentum flows smoothly through setup, ritual, ascent, and aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“complex visual topography of sound,” “screamed of hidden history”) and generally efficient sentences that do multiple jobs—advancing action, mood, and theme at once. There is some density of figurative language, but it stays coherent and doesn’t tangle meaning or slow momentum appreciably at this length. Redundancy is minimal, and the syntax varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. To reach the very top tier, a few slightly abstract formulations (“frequency of abandonment,” “emotional resonance”) could be grounded more in concrete sensory experience in the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, grammatically clean, and information-dense, with several doing double duty for atmosphere and function (e.g., the parapet droplets as lenses). The figurative language, while frequent, is coherent and thematically aligned; there are few if any mixed metaphors. Some phrases verge on purple or redundant (e.g., doubling on “twilight” and “dusky harmony”), which could be trimmed for even sharper momentum. Overall, the prose supports rather than obscures the story’s movement and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with rich imagery (“dragging their long shadows like wounded beasts,” “masterpiece painted in ash and tears”) and good information density. At times the prose leans into purple, stacking metaphors and abstractions (“flawed beauty,” “terrified to breathe”) that risk feeling ornamental rather than strictly necessary. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained, and there are no real loops or scaffolding sentences. Tightening a few over-laden lines would easily push this into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and mood). Metaphors are mostly apt and concrete, and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. However, there is a mild tendency toward purple flourish and stacked figurative language in already-charged moments, which risks drawing attention to the prose itself (“fractured grace…like a tattered veil,” “burn a library to warm himself, then weep over the ashes”). This slightly dulls the edge of otherwise excellent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“her heavy silk robes trailing behind her like spilled ink on a blank page”). Momentum is generally well maintained; exposition is concise and embedded in scene rather than delivered as blocks. However, the density of figurative language is very high throughout, especially in high-pressure beats, which occasionally risks purple excess and leaves little room for plainer, grounding lines. A touch more variation in texture and a few cuts to redundant intensifiers would elevate this into the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and non-redundant (“meteor hush,” “ink sucked back into the nib”) and does not obscure causality or scene mechanics. There are no evident loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates dragging momentum. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency toward saturation—nearly every line strives for metaphor—which risks numbing impact but doesn’t yet tip into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, character) without obvious padding. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled (“blushing stillness,” “bruised sky,” “white ocean of the stratosphere”) and coherent within a visual palette. There are mild brushes with purple—stacked metaphors and repeated sky-color personification—that risk saturation but do not obscure clarity or the closure image. Sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum in what is fundamentally a still, contemplative scene.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some purple density—metaphor and heightened phrasing in nearly every line—which slightly blurs sharpness and can feel redundant in places (“frozen cathedral,” “icebound sanctum,” etc.). Still, cause-and-effect remain clear, and the closure image is not muddied by figurative excess. A bit more restraint and contrast in texture would lift it into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences mostly carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) and the rhythm varies well. Some metaphors verging on purple (“painting the sky above the forest canopy in bruises of violent purple and heavy lead”) risk over-saturation but remain coherent rather than muddled. There are no obvious loops or scaffold sentences, and the closure image is clear and uncluttered. A slight trim of figurative density in a few spots would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush yet mostly disciplined: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, character, mood) with little scaffolding or repetition. Imagery like “reality…peeled back like a layer of old parchment” and “obsidian floor…inlay of silver dust” is precise, apt, and thematically charged. There is a mild tendency toward density—nearly every sentence is figurative or elevated—which edges toward purple but does not obscure clarity or momentum. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to keep rhythm dynamic, and the final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean and propulsive, with vivid imagery (“sea of churning mercury,” “swirling cosmos of violet color”) and minimal redundancy. Sentences carry multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, emotion, and theme—without major clutter, and action order stays clear. There is a slight tendency toward density of figurative and conceptual language in close proximity, which occasionally risks purple or over-explained insight. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and no line-level artifact meaningfully blurs the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, action) and generally maintain clarity despite high figurative density. There are a few spots of near-redundant intensification (“cold and sharp, possessing the fragile, menacing clarity…”) and sustained metaphor stacking that verge on purple, modestly dragging momentum. Figurative logic remains coherent, and the final image (“air rang like a crystal bell”) lands cleanly. Overall propulsion is good, but a lighter touch in spots would better match elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little redundancy, and figurative language is vivid but controlled (“vaulted skeleton,” “bleeding violet light”). Rhythm varies naturally and paragraphing supports momentum through the breach’s escalation and the rummaging beat. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or muddy metaphors that obscure action or stakes. A few dense descriptive clusters edge toward lush, but they remain clear and purposeful rather than purple.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with high information density and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and purposeful, building a coherent lexicon of light, pages, and radiation rather than devolving into purple churn. Sentences typically do double duty—advancing atmosphere and concept simultaneously—and the final line crisply recharges multiple motifs. A few compounded abstractions (“luminous anxiety,” “brightened disquiet”) edge toward over-stacked descriptors, but they do not materially slow or obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are precise, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“smelling faintly of ozone and regret”), and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, maintaining a consistent lexical field around books, bodies, and botany. Momentum is preserved despite lush description; the prose rarely stalls on ornament. A slight tendency toward compound-high-concept phrasing (“pressure of unread sentences,” “web of sticky, translucent prose that shimmered with ‘what-ifs’”) may risk saturation for some readers, but it doesn’t materially obscure cause or effect.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density—most sentences do double duty in advancing mood, world, or theme. Metaphors are generally apt and not meaningfully mixed; the ship/ body/ vessel echoes stay controlled and purposeful. There is some lushness that edges toward purple but rarely tips over, and there are no visible scaffold loops or mechanical cadences that drag momentum. The richness slightly blunts urgency in a few spots, but clarity and cadence hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, imagistic, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“The engine of history was disconnected from the bell of the present.”). Momentum is maintained despite the abstract premise; we rarely feel bogged down by explanation. There is some leaning toward purple or redundant metaphor, but it doesn’t cloud sense or closure, and the line-level clarity holds even at the climax. Variation in syntax and paragraphing is adequate, preventing mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, vivid, and information-dense, with relatively little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, building a sonic-metaphoric field (noise as scraping, tearing, fabric) rather than scattered ornament. A few phrases edge toward purple or mixed-metaphor territory (“warm blanket of iron,” “screaming static…scoured the stone walls”) but they don’t obscure action or closure. Overall momentum is maintained cleanly, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, world, or immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and efficient: most sentences carry worldbuilding, atmosphere, and emotional charge simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and non-redundant; images like “tapestry of rust and shadow” and “thistle-blown hope” are vivid without stacking into muddle. Syntax varies well, and there are no obvious scaffolding phrases or synonym loops that stall momentum. A few abstractions (“chaotic noise of entropy”) flirt with grandiosity, but they don’t obscure the story’s clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, with vivid, specific images doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme). The prose generally propels forward; there are few outright scaffolds or paraphrase loops, and the syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence. However, figurative and abstract language is quite dense across the whole piece, occasionally bordering on purple and risking saturation (“carving the vague anxieties of her people into a definitive shape,” “epoch after fog becomes solid”). A bit more restraint or contrast at a few points—especially around interior summary—would sharpen the impact of the loveliest lines.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax and high information density—most sentences carry both atmosphere and character. Vivid metaphors and personifications (“chemistry of stars,” “blindfold of night,” “garden of living light”) generally land cleanly and reinforce motif. There is a slight excess of figurative language in places, edging toward lushness that doesn’t always raise pressure, but it doesn’t obscure causality or closure. Overall momentum holds, even if the prose occasionally adorns more than it drives.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, varied, and information-dense, and many images (“limestone ceiling opened like a fractured eye,” “fibrous and tough, like the husk of a coconut floating between islands”) are striking. The prose sometimes edges toward purple with stacked abstractions (“discover the texture of time”) and metaphor density, but coherence is maintained. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding sentences, or syntactic glitches, and the final cadence lands cleanly. Trimming a few figurative flourishes would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are generally fresh, and most lines do double duty in advancing atmosphere and character. Metaphors like “disturbingly intangibly tangible” or “molten gold poured into the empty spaces between her atoms” flirt with density but stay legible and thematically apt. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and prose momentum carries smoothly through the ritual. A slight tendency toward piled imagery in high-intensity moments keeps this just short of truly top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and generally strong sentence-level rhythm; most lines do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. There is some purple-leaning metaphor stacking (“wild and feral” silence, “cathedral built by giants”) that risks over-saturating key beats without adding new pressure. Redundancies are minimal, transitions are smooth, and the closure image is clear. Trimming a few modifiers and tightening one or two figurative clusters would raise impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally lean and evocative, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building plus mood plus motion) without obvious scaffolding or synonym-churn. Imagery like the wall’s “gray, blistered surface curled away like dead skin” and the orchard’s chrome trees is strong and clear. There is a mild tilt toward purple at times (“kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “oil-slick rainbows,” “ancient photons”), but it rarely muddies sense or stalls momentum. Tightening a few stacked modifiers and ensuring high-pressure beats are slightly more clipped would further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density—most sentences are doing atmospheric, emotional, and structural work simultaneously. Metaphors (burnt cathedral, loaded emptiness, linking through scars) are consistent and non-muddled, and paragraphing supports momentum through the choice moment. There is some propensity toward lushness and layered modifiers that edge close to purple, but they remain legible and do not stall the scene. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony degrading the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “thunderclap inside a glass jar” and “light…stitch the shadows together” are vivid yet legible, and most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and plot). Rhythm varies well between lush description and clipped, pressured beats during the climax. Figurative density is high but controlled; metaphors are coherent with the established world logic and don’t tangle. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, though trimming one or two abstract intensifiers could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, with most sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or mechanics plus theme) and strong rhythm control (“ancient bones grinding together inside a metal ribcage” is vivid yet clear). Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors tend to be thematically apt and grounded in the scene’s physicality. There are minor brushes with density—occasional double-stacked descriptors or abstract phrases that could be trimmed without loss—but no serious loops or muddle that obscure causality or dull the climax. Line-level craft is publishable as-is with only light polish.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly tight, concrete, and multi-functional, advancing atmosphere and action together. Figurative density is high yet usually coherent (“pod… containing every color… and several he had not” is a good example of precise strangeness). There’s minor flirtation with purple prose and stacked modifiers, but clarity and momentum never significantly suffer, including at the climax. Variations in sentence length and paragraphing create a pleasing rhythm that supports escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Some metaphors ("relentless friction of documented tragedy against cold paper") are rich but still clear and thematically apt rather than ornamental. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues, and the prose sustains momentum despite reflective density. The piece leans lyrical but stops short of purple, keeping images disciplined and aligned with Elias’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is vivid and economical; most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing action, worldbuilding, and tone simultaneously). Metaphor density is high but generally coherent, with few if any mixed or strained images, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There’s minimal scaffold or repetition, and action is clear even through lyric description. At times the language leans toward purple, but it doesn’t significantly obscure causality or flatten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm and length, images are vivid, and most metaphors (“a sound like wind dying in a chimney”) are sharp and apt. Prose density is high but rarely feels like purple overload, and repetition is minimal and mostly intentional. Nearly every sentence adds either atmosphere or pressure; there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym-churn. The main limitation is that figurative richness seldom drops into a starker, more cutting register at the peak, which could have heightened impact.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing multiple jobs (world, mood, and character). Imagery is rich but not so stacked as to blur sense, and there is little paraphrase looping or scaffolding. A few modifiers and abstractions (“mossy delight,” “heavy with potential”) lean conventional, but they don’t materially slow momentum or muddle the climax. The transformation and final image are rendered with precision and good acoustic control.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, most carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and character), and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is vivid but mostly controlled, with only occasional near-purple moments (“timeframe when coincidence becomes pattern”) that remain legible. Momentum is sustained throughout; even descriptive passages advance mood and stakes rather than stalling. The prose doesn’t quite reach a singularly distinctive stylistic brilliance, but it is clean, efficient, and textured enough for high-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and many images doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. However, figurative density is very high—“factually mystical,” “luminous regret,” “specific ionic residue”—and occasionally shades into purple, trading sharpness for ornament. A few conceptual loops (reiterating the theory of names’ weight) slow momentum slightly. Clarity at closure remains intact, but tightening some metaphors and pruning redundancy would lift this to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“grey, purgatorial twilight,” “luminous ache”) and generally high information density—most sentences advance mood, character, or plot. Rhythm is varied enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical, and figurative language is vivid without becoming a tangled or over-stacked pattern. Redundancies are minimal, and action remains clear throughout the summoning and release. A handful of abstract labels (“self-imposed seriousness and crushing dignity”) skim cliché-adjacent terrain but don’t materially drag the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are varied, dense with information, and most metaphors sharpen rather than blur (“stripping varnish from a raw nerve” is a standout). Figurative language is frequent, verging on lush, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than devolving into pure ornament. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases; nearly every sentence earns its place. The main limitation is sheer density—at times the lyric intensity risks fatigue, preventing this from reaching the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is polished: varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually do more than one job (e.g., the soot dissolving into the storm-tossed ocean). Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent, and there’s little in the way of paraphrase loops or scaffolding. A few constructions border on purple or abstract (“anchors of intuition flared bright gold,” “repository of endurance”), but they don’t significantly blur sense or momentum. Overall, the prose has good rhythm and density suitable for high-tier markets, if not quite at the razor-edge of concision.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and purposeful description that advances both mood and mechanics. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and apt (“weightless burden,” “held time hostage”), and technical detail is integrated without becoming infodump. There are minor tendencies toward over-rich phrasing and stacked modifiers, but they don’t obscure clarity or closure. Momentum is maintained from entry to final image without obvious scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tightly controlled, varied in rhythm, and information-dense—most lines do double duty for setting, mood, and concept. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, without mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops. Action remains clear even amid lyric description, particularly in the press sequence and ensuing fracture. Minor risk of “purple” excess never tips into genuine opacity or momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-dense, with very few redundant or scaffold sentences; metaphors like “hours drifted…like phosphorescent pollen” feel both fresh and conceptually grounded. The density of figurative language is high but usually purposeful and legible, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. Momentum holds through description, though an editor might trim one or two ornate phrases to sharpen impact. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the closing sentence lands with a precise, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. There is some risk of purple density—metaphors stacked in quick succession (“light that seemed to remember the dawn,” “light stolen by midnight,” “golden, audible clarity”)—but coherence is maintained and momentum rarely stalls. Syntax varies well, and virtually every sentence pushes either pressure, image, or concept. A bit more sparing use of high-intensity figurative language in peak beats would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush, image-dense, and generally precise; lines such as “the smell of the earth dreaming of rain” and “breath of the impossible” are memorable and apt. Most sentences do double duty, advancing atmosphere and concept simultaneously without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There is a mild risk of purple prose due to stacked metaphors and modifiers in some passages, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No major loops, mixed metaphors, or technical errors interfere with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and vivid imagery that usually pulls double duty (character and world-building at once). Sentences vary in rhythm, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each beat tends to add new texture or advance action. Occasionally, figurative language piles up (“banshee,” “alphabet,” “skeletal leviathan,” “phantom map”) enough to flirt with purple, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or pacing. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor restraint needed in metaphor density.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense and often beautiful, with figurative language that mostly aligns—“umbral tenderness,” “drifts of fallen gold,” “bio-luminescent pulse.” Sentences usually do more than one job (setting, mood, and theme at once), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. The main limitation is a slight tendency toward uniform lushness, which risks purple at moments and could benefit from a few plainer lines to sharpen contrast and momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clean, varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is rich but usually coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or scaffolding repetition. A few phrases flirt with purple (“vibrating with a searing reverie”) yet do not obscure sense or momentum. There is little to no paraphrase looping, and the final cadence is clear and pointed.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and information-dense, with purposeful repetition (“the strain of the mental exertion made sweat bead on her forehead”) building intensity. A few paraphrase-like reiterations (“mental exertion,” “working memory,” “cognitive genesis”) and stacked abstractions slightly dull momentum and could be tightened. Figurative language is mostly apt and not overdone, though occasional phrases (“vibrating thought-form,” “violent, swirling gold”) flirt with purple but remain intelligible. The final image is crisp and not obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: the prose is dense yet largely efficient, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus theme). Metaphors like “velvet disquiet” and “the fluid becomes the needle” are striking and legible, though the overall figurative density approaches purple in places. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and syntax remains clear even in complex sentences. The closure image—a quiet, heavy final entry under the stopped horn—reads crisply without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-by-line, the prose is strong: sentences often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and action), and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum despite the density. Metaphors are generally coherent and striking (“glacier sighing in reverse,” “sand slipping upward through an hourglass”), and there are few, if any, genuine logical or figurative misfires. There is some flirtation with overwriting—clusters of highly figurative phrases and abstract modifiers (“mathematically perfect,” “organized vacuum of space”) occasionally stack without adding new pressure. Still, clarity and propulsion survive, and the final image is sharp rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, purposeful repetition, and a good balance of concrete detail to abstraction. Metaphors like “bruising purple shadows” and “holy silence” are vivid, though occasionally the density of figurative language nudges toward purple without tipping into confusion. There’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Minor lushness and a few slightly over-articulated insights keep it from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are rhythmic, varied, and image-rich, with few outright redundancies or mechanical slips. Figurative language (“silver needle threading the fabric of the night,” “silent scream of brilliance”) is often striking and sensorially clear, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character insight). That said, the density of metaphors and high-register abstractions occasionally borders on purple and could be trimmed for greater impact, especially where ideas are restated in slightly different phrases. Momentum holds, but a small amount of conceptual and adjectival excess keeps this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and most images work in tandem rather than competing. The prose leans lush (“visual screaming of the dead,” “mute eloquence of the oasis”), yet avoids mixed metaphors and maintains clarity of action and image. There is mild risk of over-saturation—figurative language appears frequently—but it’s pattern-consistent and supports the chosen lyric mode rather than stalling momentum. Scaffolding or paraphrase loops are minimal to nonexistent.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“her skin hummed with the static of a life that was not technically hers”). Metaphors and images are numerous but largely coherent and thematically aligned, and momentum is maintained across the single-scene structure. A few lines lean toward on-the-nose explanation or slightly purple abstraction, and there’s mild repetition of conceptual language around time’s “texture.” Still, no major loops or artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, world-building) and are mostly free of redundancy or scaffolding. The rhythm varies well, and there are no major clarity issues or figurative muddles. However, the density of modifiers and figurative language (“scrubbed the sky until it was raw,” “burnished hush,” “metallic glow”) occasionally verges on overwriting and might benefit from a touch of pruning for elite venues. Even so, propulsion and clarity are preserved, and the closing cadence is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and efficient: nearly every sentence carries worldbuilding, character, and mood simultaneously, and the line-level clarity is high. Imagery is often striking (“geology possessed a pulse,” “battery”), and there are no obvious scaffolding loops or syntax glitches. That said, figurative density is consistently high, sometimes flirting with purple (e.g., “architectural secrets hidden deep within the temple’s foundations” plus “geological immune response” in quick succession) and leaving little room for plainer texture. For a top-tier venue, a touch more modulation—occasional spareness under pressure—would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush but controlled, with strong information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, world, and character simultaneously. Metaphors are generally apt and coherent, and the rhythmic variation between longer descriptive lines and shorter, declarative beats (“Someone else had rejected the easy ascension.”) supports momentum. There are a few spots where figurative language clusters (“bronze quiet,” “felt ancient and waiting”) skirt the edge of purple but do not blur clarity or stall the scene. No noticeable loops or scaffolding undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding (“narrow wooden pier choked with purple creepers and phosphorescent buds”). Sentence variety and paragraphing keep momentum despite the lyric density. There is a flirtation with purple prose—several metaphors and abstractions (“narrow vastness”) stack in close proximity—but clarity remains intact and repetition/looping is minimal. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication with only light trimming for concision.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and image-driven, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“the wind prowling,” “pregnant with the promise of a voice”). Rhythm generally supports the contemplative tension, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. However, figurative density leans purple in places and occasionally clunks syntactically (the long sentence explaining “reading secret texts” feels awkward and expository compared to the rest). Slight trimming of modifiers and a few tightened lines would elevate this to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors that would muddy the imagery. There are a few stretches where stacked modifiers edge toward purple, yet they don’t significantly slow momentum or obscure sense, even at the climax. Rhythm and paragraphing are varied enough to keep the piece from feeling monotonous despite its reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, syntactically clean, and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. There is some purple tilt and aphoristic phrasing that border on excess but do not seriously cloud clarity or momentum. Redundancy is limited; each step forward (tool, board, piece-swaps, sky reaction) is distinctly articulated without scaffolding loops. Rhythm and paragraphing support a smooth read, even if the figurative density could be trimmed slightly for sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, imagistic, and information-dense without obvious redundancy. Metaphors like “luminous absence” and “the missing pieces of the world seemed to glow brighter than what remained” are striking yet legible, and they’re not piled so thickly as to blur sense. There are no significant loops, scaffold phrases, or syntactic glitches that sap momentum. A few lines approach the ornate, but they remain under control and in service of mood.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without obvious redundancy, and metaphors generally cohere (“roots of golden light” stitching books, thunder turning into a heartbeat). The prose pushes toward lushness but mostly avoids purple excess or mixed imagery, maintaining clarity even in dense passages. There are no noticeable scaffold phrases or template cadences, and the closing lines land with clean, charged specificity. A few abstractions (“crushing grief of her history”) could be grounded more, but they don’t materially blunt momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are concrete, metaphors are generally fresh (“smelled of ozone and regret”), and there’s good syntactic variety. Most lines do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is relatively dense but mostly controlled, and there are no loops or mechanical cadences that bog momentum. It’s not quite in the rarefied, line-by-line astonishing tier, but it’s clearly publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, theme) at once, and maintain momentum. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; the bone and sound imagery forms a coherent lexicon rather than a jumble of mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and crucial beats (the echoes splitting, the hush shattering) are rendered crisply. A slight tendency toward thematic labeling in a few lines is the only notable softness.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and a rich metaphorical palette that usually pulls double duty for mood and theme. Lines like “a ripple of pure meaning rather than destruction” and “releasing her breath as a silver bubble” are evocative and precise. There is a high density of figurative language, which edges toward purple in spots and risks diminishing impact through sheer accumulation. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences carry character, setting, and theme simultaneously, and there are few if any scaffolding or redundant lines. Metaphors generally land cleanly and stay coherent with the physical logic (e.g., “a ghost in a coat of paint-splattered tweed,” “the damp throat of the cave system”). A mild tendency toward lush, image-heavy description occasionally flirts with purple but does not obscure meaning or dampen momentum in this meditative mode. Syntax and paragraphing support a smooth read with a well-judged final cadence around the shell and the broken mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but mostly disciplined; images like “screaming tenderness” and the scent of a night garden over open water are striking and precise. Sentences generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious padding or repetition. There is a density of modifiers and some heightened diction that flirts with purple, but clarity and momentum remain intact. Trimming one or two explanatory lines about intent physics could further sharpen the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional tenor. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically aligned (migration, storms, bruised oceans, swollen moons), and there’s little in the way of visible scaffolding, loops, or filler. A few metaphors cluster thickly (“bruised ocean,” “swollen eye,” “storm of history”) which nudges toward purple in that segment, slightly dulling momentum. Nonetheless, clarity and propulsion hold through the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally dense with information and atmosphere, doing multiple jobs at once without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is vivid and usually controlled, rarely tipping into purple; metaphors (empathy as “ambient scream,” the lie as “sweetest truffle”) are coherent and character-rooted. There are no notable loops, scaffolding artifacts, or rhythm glitches that impede momentum or clarity. Minor abstractions aside, the prose would be competitive at high-end venues with minimal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich imagery and a good balance of sentence lengths that maintain momentum despite the contemplative mode. Many lines multitask, advancing setting, character, and theme simultaneously (“a beam that did not illuminate space, but rather illuminated time”). There is mild purple-prose pressure—dense modifiers and conceptual phrasing repeated in close proximity (“borrowed memories,” “psychological debris,” “ocean of time”)—but it rarely obscures meaning. Line-level tightening could heighten impact, yet clarity and cadence at the close remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (“geological impossibility,” “map of his grief”) is generally apt and not over-stacked; the prose edges toward lush but rarely tips into purple. Redundancy is minimal and momentum is maintained even during reflective passages. A few abstractions (“his own life shrank to a single, empty apartment”) are slightly more told than shown, but they don’t materially drag the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and figurative language that is mostly precise and coherent. The prose balances atmosphere with momentum; even ornate images (“intricate, lace-like patterns of nothingness”) advance stakes or world logic. There is a slight risk of metaphor saturation, but it doesn’t obscure meaning or blur causality, including at the ending. No obvious scaffolding, synonym loops, or mechanical cadences mar the read.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent, and metaphors (light as sand, “density of presence”) stay within an internally consistent conceptual field. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic tedium, and the final image is crisp and undulled. At times the register skirts the edge of purple, but it remains controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient, with metaphors that are coherent and purposeful rather than decorative (“sunburned flesh,” “slurry of disjointed moments”). Sentence rhythm varies well, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The metaphor load is high in places, but it rarely obscures sense or stalls momentum. Line-level craft is very close to elite-publishable, needing only slight trimming of occasional intensifier phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually do multiple jobs (e.g., fog as both weather and emotional isolation, the screw as both tool and legacy). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent; it rarely tips into purple, and there are no confusing mixed metaphors or loops that stall momentum. Minor redundancies (fog pressing twice, a few abstract descriptors) don’t materially blunt the closure image. The final sentences are clean and resonant, tying motif and emotion without over-writing.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, character) without obvious padding, and metaphors tend to be apt (bruised sky, ice cracking on a lake). A few phrases push toward purple, but they don’t muddle sense or stall momentum, especially since pressure is mostly maintained. There are no evident scaffold/loop artifacts or mechanical cadences, and syntax remains clear even in the densest descriptive stretches. The closing sentences land crisply, with a clear before/after image and no figurative tangle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and mostly economical—details like “smelled of lignin and neglect” or “a gray vapor poured out, smelling of roses and ozone” do multiple jobs at once. Rhythm varies well; there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the scene advances with each paragraph. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and grounded, though a couple of similes (“like a pistol crack,” “before the orchard’s trees are cut down”) nudge toward familiarity rather than surprise. Overall line-level craft is strong enough for a high-tier market with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and stakes) with little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. The rhythm varies well between long, baroque lines and sharper clauses (“‘Unify,’ she whispered…”), which gives the climax impact. Some metaphors and modifiers are rich to the edge of purple, and abstractions like “temporal spasm” and “visual madness” cluster in a few spots, nudging clarity but not breaking it. Overall density and propulsion are strong enough for immediate publishability at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without redundancy, and figurative language is predominantly precise and aligned with the core metaphors of fluid vs. razored time. Phrases like “a sound erupted that was not sound, but a severance of the sensory field” stretch language in a way that feels purposeful rather than purple, and there’s minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn. Occasional intensifiers (“terrifying glassiness,” “screaming friction of raw chronology”) are a shade on-the-nose, and the density of metaphor in the central metaphysical passage risks a slight saturation. Still, clarity and momentum are largely preserved through the climax and into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and often striking—images like “velvet-heavy hours” and the air system as a “soft exhalation” give texture and atmosphere. Most sentences do double duty, advancing both scene and theme, and momentum is maintained without expository drag. The density of metaphor occasionally pushes toward purple (“quiet wildfire,” “physics of release”), with some phrases restating similar ideas about boundaries and breath, but not enough to blur sense or undercut closure. Line-level craft is strong, if sometimes slightly over-ornamented for the scale of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are largely precise, and most sentences carry multiple weights (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Occasional abstractions (“deep need to widen perspectives responsibly,” “core concept of this impossible place”) blunt immediacy but do not seriously stall momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent and purposeful; there are few if any mixed metaphors or obvious scaffold lines. Overall, the prose would require only light tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and generally high-density: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, function) with clean rhythm and varied structure. Images are often striking and apt, and repetition is used meaningfully rather than as scaffold. There are a few near-purple phrases and thematic labels (“critical emotional loop,” “impossible geometry of their pain,” the closing mission line) that lean into abstraction rather than concrete embodiment. Still, these do not materially obscure sense or closure, keeping the line-level craft strong if just shy of the sharpest minimalism expected at very top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and imagistic, largely in a good way: metaphors like “violet sky bruised into true night” and “a joy so intense it felt like a ghost passing through her ribs” are vivid, coherent, and on-theme. Most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or process plus theme), maintaining momentum despite lyricism. It does verge on purple in places, and nearly every sentence carries figurative weight, which might feel slightly over-rich in a venue demanding extreme restraint. Nonetheless, clarity is never sacrificed, and there are no notable loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and function, carry multiple layers (world, character, tone) at once, and rarely feel redundant. Figurative language is vivid but generally controlled (e.g., “a rumor is just a truth that’s had a few drinks”), with only minor flirtations with abstraction that don’t obscure meaning. Momentum holds from exposition into the quiet climax without sag; there’s little scaffolding or looped paraphrase. A touch of rhetorical flourish in the last paragraph verges on purple but doesn’t blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally concise given the lyric mode, and carry multiple functions (world-building, emotion, and motion) efficiently. Metaphors are numerous but mostly coherent and purposeful; they rarely muddle the physical situation. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and transitions between beats are smooth. The main limitation is mild purple-prose pressure in places, where density of imagery slightly blurs immediacy rather than always sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, often doing double work for worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined, with recurring motifs rather than random flourish, and there are few if any true redundancy loops. The prose occasionally skirts purple—nearly every line strives for metaphor, and some formulations (“pulled the darkness from the room and laid it down as law”) sit close to abstraction—but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure. Overall, momentum holds and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery and generally clean grammar and syntax; lines like “treating the negative space between her fingers as notes on a staff” efficiently do multiple jobs. There is some tendency toward purple repetition (silence/void/negative space are thematically rephrased several times without always adding new nuance), which slightly blunts momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it rarely collapses into mixed metaphors or confusion. Overall line-level work is strong but not yet ruthlessly compressed or varied enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and plot in the same move). Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned with fire, geology, and archives, with few signs of purple excess or mixed imagery. There is minor repetition around “volcanic tenderness” and “fire” that edges toward over-insistence but doesn’t materially drag momentum or obscure meaning. The prose reads as carefully tuned and publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and dense with information that usually advances both atmosphere and story. Imagery is inventive and mostly coherent, and there are few true redundancies or scaffolding phrases. However, there is a consistent tilt toward purple—stacked modifiers and big abstractions (“auric lagoon,” “auroral sorrow,” “final, eternal bloom”)—that occasionally risk feeling overdetermined or slightly melodramatic. Tightening a few of the more ornate lines would sharpen impact without sacrificing the lyric quality.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences are varied, dense, and largely free of redundancy, with some striking images (“world made of metal echoes,” “whisper the electrons to sleep”). Momentum holds from start to finish; description is mostly doing double duty as atmosphere and mechanism. There are a few patches of purple or slightly overworked phrasing (“posture of calculated spontaneity,” some stacked modifiers) and occasional explanatory lines that could be trimmed for tautness. These mild excesses don’t obscure causality or closure, but they do keep the prose just short of elite minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in length, most do double duty for mood and action, and the mechanical detail of “brass gears and adjustable louvers” grounds the lyricism. A few phrases slide toward purple or abstract (“spiralingly calm,” “stillwater tension,” “core concept of silent empathy”), and there is some semantic overlap in describing tension and weight. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved; the figurative language rarely obscures sense, and the final image lands cleanly. Tightening a handful of high-register abstractions would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and purposeful, with strong images (“evening air into a thick, blue bruise,” “the arrival of the hush where past meets prophecy”) that build a coherent aesthetic. For the most part, sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There is some risk of metaphor saturation and a few abstract formulations (“the mechanism of their uprising was not a bomb or a manifesto”) that read more expository than embodied, particularly near the end. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained, and no major artifacts or loops dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with vivid images and generally efficient sentences that do multiple jobs at once (world-building, emotion, theme). There is a clear sense of rhythm and variation, and the prose mostly maintains momentum despite its lyric density. However, figurative language is layered heavily in some passages, occasionally flirting with purple (“baritone earthquake,” “cloud of silt and memory”), and a few abstractions restate what the imagery already shows. These choices don’t obscure causality or closure, but they slightly blunt the overall sharpness and concision expected at a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lucid, image-rich, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Metaphors (turbines as scythes, “mechanical heartbeat,” “remade hush”) are coherent and thematically aligned. There is some density of figurative language and conceptual restatement—e.g., “manufacturing a different product: a remade hush…a manufactured quietude”—that verges on slightly overwrought. Still, momentum holds and the closure image remains clear and sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and controlled; images like shadows “pooling at its base like spilled ink” and the atrium as a vessel feel apt rather than overwrought. There are minor instances of conceptual repetition (explaining the art and its dangers more than once) and a few phrases that skate close to purple without adding pressure, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closing image. Overall momentum and clarity remain high.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and action) with minimal redundancy, and rhythm varies effectively between dense description and sharper, clipped moments (e.g., the reed’s scream and the quartz shattering). Imagery is vivid but controlled; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than stacked for show. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic templates, or filter-verb piles that blunt immediacy, and the pivotal beats (the negotiation, the blowing, the shattering) read crisply. A few high-density descriptive phrases verge on lush, but they don’t impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and character) without obvious filler. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and not so dense that it obscures action or causality. There are no major loops or scaffolding phrases, and the prose maintains momentum through the key beats. A few lines flirt with abstraction or mild purple (“manipulated the physics of the bells”) but do not significantly dampen clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythms, strong verbs, and images that often do double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and specific; ozone and dust, “ocean of grief,” and “withering to bloom” feel integrated rather than ornamental. There are occasional redundancies (“genuinely artificial… synthetic diamond… manufactured perfection”) that could be tightened, though some repetition seems intentional to stress concept. Momentum is maintained throughout, with little scaffolding or summary bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: vivid images, varied syntax, and generally high information density with minimal scaffolding. A few phrases verge on purple or redundant (“the debris of a bankrupt era,” “cartomancer of the aftermath”) but do not obscure sense or pacing. Expository patches near the end flatten rhythm slightly as they summarize the conspiracy instead of letting more of it stay in charged implication. Overall, momentum holds and the final sentence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—most sentences simultaneously advance worldbuilding, mood, and character. Occasional redundancy (“pure, unadulterated sentimentality”; repeated formulations of beauty destroyed by greed) and stacked modifiers flirt with purple but don’t obscure meaning. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and paragraphing supports momentum from approach to climax to exit. Line-level craft is publishable with only light tightening to reduce minor overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but mostly precise, with images that pull multiple weights (the stone as geology, anchor, and container of hope; spores as oppressive light). Sentence rhythm varies, and most lines advance atmosphere, theme, and character simultaneously. There is a lot of figurative language, yet it remains coherent and legible; it rarely tips into muddled or mixed metaphors. A slight trimming of ornamentation in non-peak moments could sharpen momentum further, but line-level craft is already at a high, near-publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich, and purposeful, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing action, character, and atmosphere simultaneously). Key lines such as the necrotic skin “flaked away like old parchment” are vivid without obscuring clarity, and action sequencing in the surgery remains easy to follow. There is some tendency toward abstraction and familiar metaphor (“bedrock of trust,” “wreckage of his deception”) that borders on mild purple but doesn’t significantly drag momentum. No notable loops or structural scaffolding mar the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-by-line, the prose is strong, with high information density and very few redundant or purely scaffolding sentences; nearly every line advances either atmosphere, character, or conflict. Metaphoric language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, and key actions (digging, the hourglass shattering, touching the root) are clear. The tendency toward rich figurative layering in almost every sentence edges toward purple in spots and could benefit from a few plainer lines for contrast. Rhythm and grammar are controlled, with no major artifacts or loops dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and concept) with few redundancies, and the syntax has a controlled musicality. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (ozone and acetate, pillars of regret, lyrics finding tune). The density edges toward purple in places, yet clarity and momentum remain intact, especially through the transfer and final image. I see no significant loops or scaffolding that would need cutting for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, clear sequencing, and high information density with few wasted lines. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, tying body, cosmos, and creativity together rather than devolving into muddle. There are minor purple-tinged or clichéd turns and a bit of thematic repetition (“trapped creativity,” “unspoken words”) that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness. Momentum never truly stalls, and the closure image remains clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“trapped moths,” “soft, decaying constants”). There is some risk of purple prose via the near-constant figurative language, but the metaphors are internally coherent and aligned with the story’s quantum-cosmic lexicon. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal; each sentence tends to move either image, mood, or conceptual frame forward. A bit more modulation—allowing a few plainer lines to sharpen the peaks—would keep the lushness from feeling slightly uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and figurative language that usually carries double duty (worldbuilding plus psychology). The prose avoids obvious loops or scaffolding, and momentum is well maintained despite a reflective, lyric mode. There is some tendency toward lushness—multiple metaphors per paragraph, occasional near-redundant statements about insight or unravelling—which risks mild purple but doesn’t seriously obscure clarity. Tightening a handful of explanatory lines would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and multi-functional: sentences often advance atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotion simultaneously (e.g., the ticket punch scene and falling star). Figurative language is vivid but mostly disciplined; images like the leash as severed root and courage pooling in high places are clear and non-muddled. There is a slight tendency toward purple or explanatory phrasing in a few spots (“This was the sole motivation…”), and a couple of sentences could be trimmed without losing content. Still, rhythm, clarity, and momentum are well maintained, and closure is not dulled by line-level excess.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and usually do more than one job, advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Imagery is vivid (“like his fingertips were being dipped repeatedly into molten glass”) and largely coherent, though metaphor density is high enough at times to flirt with purple. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line earns its place and momentum is sustained through the ascent. The lushness is a feature here, but that same richness keeps it just shy of the absolute sharpest, most distilled prose.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and vivid metaphors that often do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Sentences generally flow cleanly, and cause-and-effect remains legible even in the most figurative passages. However, the sustained intensity of imagery and modifiers (“drifting somewhere between the memories of gods and the nightmares of men,” “dark as a bruised ego”) veers toward purple, occasionally risking overload rather than escalation. There are no evident loops or scaffolding, but a touch more spareness around the climax would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally tight, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; many sentences carry worldbuilding, character, and mood simultaneously. Figurative language is used judiciously and coherently (“drifting moored,” “delay revelation that reshaped his understanding of the abyss”), avoiding mixed metaphors and purple excess. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or technical stumbles that slow momentum or blur the closure image. A few abstractions (“latent potential,” “periodically eternal”) skim the edge of conceptual rather than sensory, but they don’t materially harm clarity or cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with few redundancies and clean grammar throughout. Metaphors are occasionally rich (“thunderous serenity,” “stars had not yet taken their throne”) but mostly controlled and not over-stacked. There’s minimal scaffold or looping, and information density is high without becoming opaque. A slight tendency toward purple phrasing in places keeps it just shy of truly exceptional, but readability and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, vivid, and generally efficient, with most doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character in one move). Metaphors are concrete and apt (“screamed in her mind, a chaotic chorus of high-pitched static”), and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffold. The tendency toward stacked abstractions in a few phrases (“turning caution into a stagnant religion,” “implanted destiny”) slightly blunts immediacy but doesn’t obscure causality or closure. Rhythm and clarity hold under peak action, and there are no major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but generally precise, with metaphors that clarify rather than blur (“fragile lung of greenery,” “tactile ruin of the paper”) and a good balance of sensory modes. Sentences carry multiple loads—advancing mood, character, and theme simultaneously—without notable redundancy or scaffold. Rhythm tightens appropriately during the panic, then lengthens as he regains control, giving the piece a clear sonic arc. It veers close to purple in places, but never enough to stall momentum or obscure action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet mostly efficient, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“luminescent ache that made his bones throb with a beautiful, unbearable nostalgia”). Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (light, knots, canvases, glitches) rather than scattershot, and syntax varies enough to avoid monotony. Momentum rarely stalls; description generally advances stakes or reframes theme. A few phrases flirt with purple excess, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with most sentences pulling double duty for atmosphere and character (“temporary city of tents and erosion that groaned under the gale” is a good example). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur clarity, and there are few, if any, true paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Rhythm varies well between longer, lyrical lines and shorter, forceful beats in the confrontation, keeping momentum intact. At times the language edges toward purple, but it remains controlled and intelligible, never obscuring action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and images that do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme together). There are several striking lines (“the silence…like oxygen deprivation,” “pregnant with the noise of the world waking up”), and scaffolding or synonym loops are notably absent. At times, figurative language stacks up (“ultimate manifestation of contraband truths,” “firestorm that would melt the city’s foundations”), nudging toward melodrama but without undermining clarity or closure. Tightening a few intensifiers would make this publishable at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rich and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and character (“ballast sand provided the weight of memory, while her whispers provided the moral compass”). There is some tendency toward stacked metaphors and high-density imagery, but they mostly cohere rather than muddle sense. Momentum is maintained despite lyricism; each paragraph advances either the immediate situation or the conceptual stakes. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts undercut clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but mostly carries its weight: metaphors are striking and generally coherent, and each sentence tends to do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and action). There is some risk of purple prose—clusters like “predatory, drowsy hum” and “feral lullaby…teeth hidden in velvet” stack intensifiers—but they remain legible and thematically aligned rather than muddling the scene. Momentum is maintained; there’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the syntactic variety supports a strong read-aloud rhythm. With a touch of tightening around the heaviest figurative runs, this would be publication-ready line work.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm and diction are well controlled, with a good mix of lyricism and clarity; most lines accomplish multiple tasks (worldbuilding, character, and theme) without padding. Figurative language is noticeable but not so dense as to become purple, and metaphors are coherent with the story’s imagery of ink, paper, and orbits. There are no significant scaffolding loops or syntactic templates, and the action—though mostly mental—is easy to follow beat by beat. A hair more restraint in explicitly restating concepts (e.g., “orbit of regret” near the end) would push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently strong, with high information density—most sentences are doing double duty for mood and motion. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise, and metaphors support rather than muddle the scene; there are no significant loops or scaffolding phrases. Syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm lively, especially around the activation and tethering sequences. It flirts with purple in a couple of spots, but never enough to obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; nearly every sentence contributes to atmosphere, world, or stakes. Metaphors are often striking and conceptually coherent, and the syntax varies enough to maintain rhythm. There is a mild tendency toward purple prose and stacked modifiers—“a sickly sweetness that made the back of Elian’s neck prickle with a specific, colorful anxiety”—that risks saturation without always adding new pressure. Nonetheless, clarity at the climax and closure remains intact, and there are no significant loops or mechanical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rich and mostly economical: descriptions usually carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; while it occasionally brushes purple (“void to bleed through in streaks of violet and black”), it does not muddle clarity or pacing. Sentence structures vary and maintain forward momentum, and there are no obvious repetition loops or scaffolding sentences. Minor over-densities of modifiers in early paragraphs are the main restraint keeping this below top-tier line work.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight and high-density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening atmosphere, and revealing character. Sensory and figurative language are rich but mostly coherent and thematically aligned with theatre, time, and synesthesia. There is some stacking of metaphors and elaborate description that could be pared without loss, which slightly blurs edges in a few spots. Still, clarity and momentum hold, and there are no noticeable scaffolding loops or mechanical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but generally clean and purposeful: images like “screeching feedback loop” and “phantom voices screaming” are vivid without becoming muddled. Most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and image) with minimal redundancy. Figurative language around light, fractals, and glass is coherent and thematically integrated rather than decorative. There are very few, if any, paraphrase loops or purple flourishes that stall momentum, though one or two descriptors (“willowglass hope,” “cathedral of geometry”) flirt with grandiosity while still landing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, usually doing double duty for worldbuilding and interiority. Figurative language (“swirling aurora of grief and hope,” “language of ghosts rendered in thermal precision”) is controlled and largely fresh, without piling into purple excess. There are no evident paraphrase loops or structural scaffolds; momentum is maintained even through conceptual explanation. A few high-level abstractions (“factually mystical,” “song of regeneration”) skirt generality but are supported by enough concrete context to land.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: images like “canyon echo in a jar,” “discarded punctuation marks of the valley’s people,” and the swirling, gravity-defying sand are fresh and precise. Most sentences earn their keep by doing double duty—worldbuilding and theme or action and emotion—without obvious padding. A few lines move into abstract summary (“The process was slow, but the core concept of shared wisdom began to manifest”) or on-the-nose explanation, which slightly dulls momentum and subtlety. Overall, though, rhythm, clarity, and information density are well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information; metaphors are vivid and generally coherent with the physical situation. Rhythm varies well between long, atmospheric lines and shorter, action-focused ones at key beats (“He opened the damaged lid with a sharp snap of his thumb.”). There are no obvious scaffolding loops or synonym churn; almost every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. At times the figurative language brushes the edge of purple, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image, so it reads as a deliberate, high-level stylistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density and generally purposeful figurative language; phrases like “palimpsest promise” and “spindrift serenity” are striking and apt for the material. Sentences vary in length and structure, creating a smooth cadence that carries the reader without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. Metaphor stacking is frequent but coherent—threads, parchment, dripping, percolation—without mixing vehicles in a way that muddies meaning. There is little wasted language, and the final image is sharp and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite the lyricism, images are clear, and most metaphors are controlled and coherent with pottery, bees, light, and time. Information density is high; description nearly always does double duty for atmosphere and theme. There are occasional purple-leaning phrases and slightly redundant conceptual restatements, especially around the oasis’s nature, but they don’t materially drag momentum. The final paragraphs maintain clarity and rhythm, keeping the closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally disciplined and coherent, contributing to mood and meaning rather than obscuring action. Key beats (the petal’s fall, the joint loosening, the “quivering hush”) are rendered with clear physical logic and rhythm. There is a slight risk of lushness, but it does not impede clarity or momentum in this quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with strong information density; most sentences advance both mood and idea. Figurative language is largely coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors or clotted purple patches, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. A few abstractions and near-repetitions (isolation vs. independence, autonomy) lightly blunt the sharpness of some beats, but they don’t significantly impede clarity or propulsion. The opening and closing images are especially well-formed and sonically satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and images that often do double duty (e.g., the installation as both toy and soul-mirror). Metaphors are mostly coherent and fresh, and the prose propels rather than stalls despite its lyricism. There are a few spots where figurative language clusters (“prismatic quiet,” “physical weight of peace,” “calcified helix”) flirt with purple, slightly softening momentum but not obscuring sense. No notable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts undermine clarity, including at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level work is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with vivid concrete images (needles bending against plastic, sweat on dusty consoles) driving momentum. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant elaboration on the cosmic mechanics, with a couple of explanatory sentences that tell what surrounding lines have already implied. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme, not mixed or confusing. The prose is solid and publishable with some tightening, but does not yet demonstrate the near-frictionless precision and compression of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and purposeful; most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and pressure) without padding. Figurative language is present but not overwhelming, and key lines (e.g., the sound “pinning” the stones) are clear and vivid rather than muddled. There are few, if any, obvious loops or scaffold sentences, and the momentum through the climactic sequence remains strong. A handful of abstract formulations (“the core concept of this place”) lightly dull immediacy but do not materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character while maintaining clarity. Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels muddled; metaphors such as the “spark of white” as a “violent injection of life” are vivid and coherent with the art/forensics frame. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to give the paragraphing a good ear-feel. A slight tendency toward lushness is noticeable but does not impede momentum or obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense and purposeful: most sentences advance both atmosphere and character, with strong verbs and controlled, thematically coherent metaphors (rot, porosity, bruised sky, flesh-like clouds). There are no noticeable loops or synonym churn; the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony while staying musical. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent: the wet/organic imagery system supports the Weeping and spongey dread rather than feeling random. A few phrases (“spongey dread,” “porous gloom”) are on the verge of purple, but they still serve the motif and do not obscure action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences carry image, mood, and conceptual work simultaneously—and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. However, figurative language is very frequent in nearly every high-pressure beat (e.g., “concrete breathe,” “holy, artificial violet,” “pixelated amnesty”), edging toward ornamental at times. The prose remains legible, but the sustained metaphor load risks numbing impact and slightly blurs emphasis. Variation in texture and a few plainer anchor sentences would likely heighten, rather than diminish, the piece’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but mostly efficient; images are vivid and non-redundant, and sentences often carry multiple jobs (setting, character, theme). There’s a consistent metaphorical register without mixed or incoherent figures, and the syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. A few lines edge toward purple or explanatory (“verifying his hypothesis about the cyclical nature of greed”), but they don’t significantly blur sense or stall the scene. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding artifacts, and the final image is cleanly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly tight, concrete, and multi-functional, advancing atmosphere and theme together. The prose reads smoothly aloud, with relatively few scaffolding or redundant lines. There is some density of modifiers and metaphor (“profound midnight solace,” “swirling mist,” “architecture of the cosmos”) that edges toward overwriting but does not obscure sense or momentum. Trimming a few abstract or near-duplicate phrasings at the end could sharpen the closure image further.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and deliberate, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and action, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Some metaphors run hot and close to purple, but they largely remain coherent and do not obscure causality or sequence. The pacing through the central action (tree-leaping, seed application, vines consuming light) is clear and propulsive. A slight overstacking of figurative language in places keeps it from the absolute top tier, but the line work is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but mostly precise, with strong images (“bruised thumb” sky, “root-bound visionary,” “verdant, aggressive intent”) doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, tone, and theme. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there’s little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines advance scene, concept, or character. The figurative language skates close to purple in a few stacked places, yet the metaphors are internally coherent and do not obscure action or causality. Tightening a handful of heavily modified sentences could elevate it to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and action) and generally avoid redundancy or scaffolding. The figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned with bones, roots, and contracts, seldom tipping into muddle. Phrases like “fiercely gentle precision” and “dusky resolve of the orchard’s guardians” are vivid and memorable, though the density occasionally brushes against purple territory. Overall momentum remains intact, and the final paragraph lands with clarity and weight.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, with vivid, efficient images (“graveyard of sound,” “ghostly ringing in his ears”) and good rhythmic variation. Most sentences do multiple jobs at once—advancing action, deepening character, and sustaining atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few phrases (“giants walked the stage,” the abstract “emotional fallout of his public humiliation”) skirt familiarity or slight over-explanation but do not materially blunt momentum or clarity. The final image of the scrap’s weight against his thigh is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally avoid redundancy, with images often doing double duty for setting and emotion (“a resonance that felt less like a machine starting and more like a throat clearing to speak”). Figurative language is frequent but thematically patterned (language/physics/botany) rather than random, so it doesn’t collapse into purple prose. There are a few borderline-lush phrases where multiple metaphors stack (“haunted ambitions,” “dormant promise that terrified Elian with its silent weight”), but they don’t materially obscure action or causality. Overall momentum is maintained, and the closing image is clean and sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is economical for its density—most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and mood. The figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and motivated, with only occasional hints of purple that don’t impede clarity. Rhythm varies nicely; there’s no obvious scaffolding, loops, or template cadences, and the closure image is sharp. The diction is elevated but steady, fitting the mythic-literal hybrid mode.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, metaphors are largely coherent and grounded in the setting, and almost every line contributes either to atmosphere or to the central decision. Phrases like the description of the pearl “formed layer by agonizing layer around the irritant of unresolved grief” exemplify multi-function sentences that carry image, world logic, and theme. There is a mild tendency toward density of figurative language, which risks purple prose but mostly stays on the controlled side and does not obscure sense or momentum. Minimal scaffold or redundancy appears, and the closing image is clean and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme), and mostly avoid redundancy. Figurative language is rich but generally controlled and legible, and there are no significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts dulling momentum. The density flirts with purple in a few places, yet the emotional and imagistic clarity of the ending remains intact. Tightening a handful of heavily modified phrases could further sharpen impact without altering content.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and relatively little scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences carry atmosphere, world-building, and character at once. Figurative language (“light shifting from pale blue to a bruised purple”) is vivid without tipping into muddle, and syntax shifts appropriately as tension rises. There are a few abstract formulations that approach slogan (“method of cheating time she had perfected in dreams”) but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Overall line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are striking yet mostly coherent, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphoric language is frequent but thematically aligned (growth, cold, destiny, noise) and rarely tips into muddle or self-contradiction. The prose maintains momentum—each line tends to serve multiple functions (world, mood, character) rather than ornamental flourish. The only constraint on going higher is the sheer density of figurative diction, which occasionally risks overrichness at this length but never quite clogs the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-rich, with strong rhythm and generally high information density—most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Metaphors are mostly coherent and on-theme, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. There is some flirtation with purple prose (e.g., “radiant hush,” “celestial instability,” “visual snow of forgotten breakfasts”) and figurative density is high, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum. Tightening a few stacked metaphors and abstractions would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally high-density, doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion without much filler, and the rhythm reads well aloud. Metaphor is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. Some abstractions (“washed away the accumulated grime of existence,” “last residues of her own ancient hurt”) edge toward purple and slightly dilute immediacy. Overall, though, clarity and momentum remain intact and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally lean and effective despite a high metaphor density, with most images (“shimmered like oil on dark water,” “suspended chaotic orchestra”) pulling multiple duties for mood, character, and world. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there is little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic templating. A few explanatory lines (e.g., unpacking the Cloak as “a psychological weight made physical”) tip toward overclarity and slightly blunt the magic-realist feel. Overall, the line-level work is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed to avoid over-explaining already-strong images.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, and plot) and rhythm varies effectively, particularly around the grotto and ripple sequences. Some metaphoric density edges toward purple (“sound like a tongue clicking against the roof of a mouth,” “rings of silver fire”) but generally remains coherent and purposeful rather than ornamental clutter. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; exposition is integrated into action. A touch of trimming in the more abstract lines could sharpen momentum, but closure clarity and image strength remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line, the writing is polished and rhythmic, with strong verbs and specific images doing multiple jobs at once (e.g., “skimming the vertical surface of the ribcage as if it were the surface of a still pond”). The echo and bone metaphors are coherent, and the syntactic variation generally keeps momentum. There is mild purple-prose pressure—dense figurative language in many consecutive sentences and occasional redundancy (“calcified ribs” / “calcium structures”)—that could be trimmed for even greater impact. Nonetheless, clarity and propulsion remain intact, and no major loops or scaffolding artifacts undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but mostly precise, with strong sensory detail and metaphors that are internally coherent and purposeful rather than decorative. Sentences do more than one job—worldbuilding, mood, and character interiority are often carried together—and there is little to no scaffolding or synonym-looping. At moments the figurative language risks slight over-saturation, but it does not obscure clarity or dull momentum, so the line-level craft remains solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density—most sentences do at least double duty in advancing plot, mood, and character. Imagery (lanterns as “burning with orange hope,” vows as “ribbons of iridescent violet and gold”) is vivid yet controlled, and figurative language remains coherent rather than mixed. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase; the prose rarely repeats itself or bogs down in redundant explanation. It edges toward lushness but remains clear and propulsive, especially through the central dive and the jar-opening sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with strong images that carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, tone, and theme) and little to no redundant scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Information density is high yet readable, and the closure image is clean and undiluted. A few phrases lean toward high-flown abstraction (“a pervasive tone of stellar doubt”), but they do not materially harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with vivid images and a good rhythmic mix of longer, flowing sentences and shorter anchors. Key metaphors (light fracturing, fears crystallizing into jewels) are clear and coherent, avoiding purple excess. There is occasional conceptual repetition (e.g., “echo of sacrifice” and restatements of fear becoming form), but not enough to significantly drag momentum. Line-level control is solid and publishable, though a ruthless trim of redundancies could sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and densely informative without significant padding or loops. Metaphors (“sound like a plucked violin string,” “heavy door that… might swing back”) are apt and internally coherent, and the prose largely avoids purple excess despite its lushness. Almost every line advances atmosphere, world logic, or pressure; the rhythm supports the slow-counting tension of the scene. A touch more spareness at peak beats could heighten impact, but the current texture is solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, generally concise, and often carry multiple loads (advancing action while deepening mood). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess; phrases like “the dark rumor persisted like a fungus” are both vivid and precise. There’s little evidence of scaffold, repetition, or syntactic templating, and the closing image is clear and undulled by ornament. Momentum is appropriate for a reflective, accumulative piece and never bogs down in redundant phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush but generally precise, with strong verbs and vivid images that advance atmosphere and character rather than sitting as decorative excess. Sentences vary in length and structure, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum holds through the climax. At times modifiers and metaphors stack (“bruised purple,” “ancient freshness,” “apples and eternity”), flirting with purple prose but stopping short of obscuring sense or causality. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, largely concise, and pull multiple weights (world-building, emotion, and action intertwined). The figurative language is frequent but mostly pointed and not muddled; images like the buckle’s click “like a gunshot” in thin air are especially effective. There are no significant loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues, though trimming a few near-redundant abstractions could sharpen impact further. Rhythm at the climax (the countdown and parachute bloom) is particularly well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: imagery is vivid, information-dense, and most lines do multiple jobs without obvious padding. Metaphors like “blade of pure silence” and “numbness cracked like ice on a frozen lake” are striking and coherent, and rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum. There is some flirtation with purple prose and conceptual layering (“reality where history was currently rewriting itself”) but it does not significantly impede clarity or pacing. The piece could benefit from a touch more concrete embodiment in high-pressure moments, but there are no major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong sensory images (“storm-born silence,” soil heaving, the acrid odor) and good sentence-level variety. Information density is solid; most lines serve both atmosphere and character. There is some purple and conceptual repetition (“liquid clarity,” “biological time bomb,” and the explicitly essay-like recap of his methodology) that nudges toward over-explanation rather than letting images do the work, but it doesn’t materially slow momentum. No significant artifacts or loops undermine clarity, and the final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is largely precise and high-impact, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“noise was physical, a tangible force designed to macerate the dense, calcified silence”). Rhythm varies well, and the line-by-line clarity of action is strong despite the lyric intensity. Some metaphor stacking and reiteration of concepts (silence as substance to be macerated/liquefied) edge toward purple, slightly blunting momentum in places. Nonetheless, there are no major loops or muddles, and the closure image is sharp and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and inventive, with high information density—most sentences perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Metaphors are generally coherent and original (“roots of sentences,” “fanaticism” in metal, “fear tasted like ozone and old paper”), with very few slips into muddle. There is some risk of over-saturation in figurative language, but the piece teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains it without major redundancy or scaffolding. Rhythm varies well enough to maintain momentum through an otherwise static confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sentences are generally precise, varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent, and momentum is preserved through the sequence of attempts and the final eruption. There is minor risk of purple density—metaphor appears in a high proportion of lines—yet it rarely muddies causality or the closure image. Tighter control of metaphor frequency in peak-pressure moments would lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight and vivid, with metaphors that are both imaginative and legible (“pregnant with potential,” “serenely electric”). Sentences tend to carry multiple loads—worldbuilding, action, and interior perception—without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. There is some density of figurative language, but it stays coherent and doesn’t blur meaning or momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the final cadence lands gracefully without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: imagery is vivid, most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character), and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few moments verge on purple or overexplicit (“It was a physical manifestation of her resilient positivity”), and figurative density is consistently high, but clarity holds throughout. Rhythm tracks the scene’s arc, with calmer description up front and more kinetic language as the ferry re-enters reality. Overall, it reads as polished and publishable with only light tightening to trim explanatory or redundant phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and imaginative metaphors (“background rushed forward to consume the foreground,” “paradox could no longer contain its own weight”) that support both mood and concept. There is some risk of overwriting—figurative language is frequent, and phrases like “realistically imaginary” and “texture of connection” repeat the conceptual frame rather than always advancing it. Nonetheless, rhythm varies, syntax remains clear, and key beats (the snapping thread, the unfolding space) are easy to visualize. Trimming a few redundant modifiers and slightly mixed metaphors would elevate this to top-tier literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing at least double duty in worldbuilding and emotion. Figurative language—“where reality was stitched together,” “unfolded horizons”—is vivid and coherent with the conceptual frame. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious generative artifacts or muddled metaphors; the final image with the chain link “like a prayer” lands crisply. A few descriptive stretches edge toward lushness that risks slowing momentum, but they don’t significantly obscure cause or effect.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and generally purposeful figurative language (“smelled of ozone and sorrow,” “shield of pure recognition”). The prose balances atmosphere with momentum; very few lines feel like scaffolding or repetition. There is a lot of metaphor and sensory texture, but it remains coherent and tied to Elara’s experience rather than spinning into purple excess. A touch more spareness during the climactic struggle could sharpen impact, yet clarity and propulsion are not compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, most do double duty with worldbuilding and tension, and there is little to no scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and legible, rarely obscuring action. Technical exposition is compact enough not to stall momentum. A handful of phrases teeter on the edge of over-intensity, but they don’t materially blur cause/effect or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid (“interior of a precious stone,” “her image tearing at the edges like old film”) without collapsing into mixed metaphors or redundancy. Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, emotion, and motion—keeping momentum while maintaining density. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and the ritual’s mechanics remain clear even under ornate description. There are very few, if any, scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the final cadence (“the only living heart beating in a world of ghosts and opal reflections”) effectively recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are clear, syntactically controlled, and information-dense, often doing atmospheric and conceptual work simultaneously. Metaphors are mostly coherent and grounded in the story’s sonic/geologic palette, and there’s little outright redundancy or scaffolding. That said, figurative language is near-constant, especially early (“skeletal fingers,” “subterranean artery,” “geological gods”), creating a slight sense of purple saturation that risks dulling sharpness. Tightening a few ornamental flourishes would give key images more room to hit.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and typically do double duty for both image and emotion (“butterflies made of light and sound” as both spectacle and tonal pivot). Metaphors are coherent and thematically linked (static, gravity, light/music), and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. A few phrases verge on purple or concept-heavy (“gravitationally playful,” “cosmic punchlines”) but they’re controlled enough not to muddy the reading or the closure. Tightening one or two adjective-heavy lines would sharpen an already effective prose surface.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean for its lyric register, with most sentences doing double duty in setting, mood, and action. Images are vivid yet controlled, and the rhythm has healthy variation; there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Some phrases verge on purple or abstract (“atmosphere curdled into a state of tarnished wonder”), but they remain intelligible and aligned with tone rather than obscuring events. Line-level craft supports momentum through the climax instead of stalling it in ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally avoid redundancy, with metaphors that are apt and often striking (“submerged, underwater glow,” “static kiss”). The prose occasionally edges toward purple with stacked descriptors, but not enough to cloud meaning or stall momentum. Expository moments are brief, and most lines do double duty for mood and mechanics. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic glitches, or figurative muddles in the closing beats, allowing the final image to land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, character) and flow smoothly, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and purposeful, sustaining mood without collapsing into muddle. There are no real loops or mechanical artifacts; syntax and punctuation are clean and readable. The only reservation is that the prose occasionally skirts purple, though it rarely impairs clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is polished, with high information density and images that usually pull double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“negative spaces of the universe,” “ache of a goodbye”). While the prose leans lush, metaphor stacking rarely tips into confusion or mixed imagery, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. Sentences vary in length and structure, preserving momentum even in descriptive passages. It’s not utterly flawless—some readers may find the density slightly rich—but it is comfortably in elite-publishable territory.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, with strong rhythm and generally purposeful metaphors (“liquid garnet,” “the hush of improbable beginnings,” “radiating a tone of luminous absence”). Sentences usually do multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There is a risk of purple prose via stacked figurative language, but coherence is maintained and key beats (the city’s emergence and unraveling) remain clear. A touch more spareness around the climax might sharpen impact, yet line-level craft is already solidly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong, with vivid metaphors and generally clean syntax; sentences often do double duty for mood and information. There is some purple density (“geometry of existence folded like heavy velvet,” “hush of cosmic possibility,” “improbable longing”) that could be trimmed for greater sharpness. Redundancy is minimal and the action remains legible even as language turns ornate. Rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum, though a bit more restraint at peak beats would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and strong rhythmic control; most sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and legible, and it supports rather than obscures the scene’s stakes. Redundancy and scaffold are minimal—there’s little sense of saying the same thing twice in different words. A slight tendency toward rich metaphor stacking in a few lines keeps it just shy of the very top band but doesn’t harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and generally high-density, with vivid images (“sound like a cracking glacier,” “glittering explosion of reversible destiny”) that carry both sensory and conceptual weight. Metaphorical language is frequent but usually disciplined, with the notable playground-swing simile adding a precise moment of poised tension. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, keeping momentum through the climactic beats and avoiding scaffolding or paraphrase loops. There is a slight flirtation with purple in places, but it does not obscure clarity or blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and very few genuine redundancies. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned with gardening, weaving, and luminosity; there is little figurative muddle. That said, the density of elevated phrasing (“a treasure too heavy for his hand but light upon his soul,” “the color of wonder”) nudges toward purple and slightly dulls momentum. Line-level craft is strong and publishable, but a stricter pruning of abstractions and repeated intensifiers would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: metaphors are fresh and coherent (“soundless pressure,” “optical cage,” silence like “thick, invisible syrup”) and most sentences pull double-duty advancing both action and atmosphere. There are no significant paraphrase loops or syntactic templates, and the prose maintains momentum despite its density. A few images edge toward lushness, but they remain legible and thematically aligned, not self-indulgent. The opening and closing lines are especially well-calibrated, framing the piece with charged, precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with evocative yet generally restrained figurative language (“spectral pantomimes of people long gone,” “trapped echoes of a thousand years”). Sentences tend to do multiple jobs—forwarding plot, deepening atmosphere, and reflecting character—without evident scaffolding or looped restatements. There are occasional slightly abstract or slogan-like formulations (“mechanism of the chapel was tuned to human emotion, not leverage”) but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is tight and imagistic, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding; phrases like “silence was heavy enough to break bone” are striking yet legible. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically apt, reinforcing the water/emotion/physics motifs rather than scattering. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose moves cleanly from beat to beat. A slight density of metaphor in spots keeps it just shy of the absolute top tier for this market, but it never obscures action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense without bloat, and most images earn their keep (e.g., “the mist into a glowing veil” at the lightning strike). Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and thematically unified around sound, circuitry, and weather, avoiding mixed metaphors. There are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences—the prose tends to advance atmosphere, character, and action at once. One could arguably trim a modifier or two, but nothing substantively drags momentum or muddies the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntactic shapes, high information density, and a clear throughline of action despite the lyric texture. Metaphors like “where the air was too thin for sorrow to linger” and “secret contraband” are vivid and mostly precise, not muddled. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence earns its place. The only limitation is occasional purple edging that adds ornament without much extra pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Phrases like “granular luminescence of dusty starlight” and “spooled wholeness” are distinctive and controlled, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. However, density of metaphor is consistently high, and a few constructions (“the chaotic logic of a grieving world,” “reaction that was quietly explosive”) lean toward purple, risking slight saturation. Line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier venues but not entirely free of ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, with high information density and minimal redundancy. Figurative language is largely apt and thematically tuned (geometry, air, recursion) without sliding into muddled metaphor. A few phrases verge on purple, but they do not obscure clarity or undercut the closing image, which lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and image-dense, with strong metaphors (“violet bruise of twilight,” “a trapped star that had forgotten how to burn out”) that generally retain clarity. Sentences typically do more than one job, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot together without obvious scaffold or loops. At times the accumulation of figurative language edges toward lush, but it rarely muddies action or causality. Line-level craft supports momentum through the revelation and cleanly lands the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty—worldbuilding and emotion (“the wind…carrying a dry, briny scent that evoked a profound driftwood nostalgia in a place that had never known the sea”). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and not self-contradictory, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The prose sometimes leans toward lushness that risks saturation (stacked metaphors in the opening, e.g., cosmic tide, leviathan ribcage) and could be sharpened slightly for maximal impact. Overall, clarity and momentum are maintained despite the density.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically considered, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors like “archways…like frozen lightning” and “brambled hope” are vivid and generally coherent with the world’s logic and tone. A few images cluster toward the ornate, but they don’t blur sense or stall momentum. Clarity remains high through the climax, with cause and effect easy to follow and no noticeable loops or filler.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent and thematically aligned (sound as color, causality as a dry seabed, darkness as “absolute zero of the void”), without lapsing into muddled metaphor chains. There is little obvious scaffold or paraphrase looping, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyric density. Occasionally, stacked abstractions (“geometry of the lullaby,” “machine of the universe”) risk slight over-aestheticizing, but not enough to impede clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and generally excellent image-work (“glob of saliva freeze solid,” “contorted mass of petrified wood and leaking oil,” “ruined painting under the dying light”). Sentences vary in length and structure, and almost all lines serve multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, and momentum together). Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and not so thick as to blur clarity; there are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts. A tiny tendency toward lushness in already-tense moments is the only thing keeping this just below “elite” line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures and high information density; most lines simultaneously carry setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is rich yet generally coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors even as it leans heavily on musical and hydrological comparisons. There is little scaffolding or redundancy, and syntax remains clear despite the lyric tilt. The only minor limitation is that the density of metaphors occasionally borders on ornate, which could risk slowing momentum in a longer piece but holds here.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and concept) and generally avoid redundancy. Figurative language is dense but coherent within a clear motif system, so it reads as luxuriant rather than muddled. There are occasional near-purple stretches (“throbbed with the weight of a thousand recorded mistakes”) but they don’t obscure causality or the closure beat. Rhythm and paragraphing support a measured, ceremonious pace that fits the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with information and metaphor yet largely clear, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, as in "a subterranean paradox preserved by the chill of forgotten crimes" and "a blizzard of silent screams." Grammar, pacing, and transitions are clean, and each paragraph either advances action or thickens atmosphere. A few constructions flirt with purple or over-stacked metaphor ("chef who can taste memories," "sandpaper rough memories") but they still align with the story’s internal logic and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: variety in rhythm, clean syntax, and high information density with most lines doing atmospheric and narrative work simultaneously. Metaphors are striking and coherent (“drag the rhythm back to earth,” “low, steady chord that matched the slowed heartbeat of the clock tower”) without devolving into clutter. There is minimal redundancy or scaffold; paragraphs progress the scene rather than restating. A slight tendency toward lush piling of descriptors keeps it below the absolute highest band, but it does not slow or obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for setting, concept, and emotion. Metaphors are generally coherent and on-theme (fractured glass, prisms, helixes, waves), and syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical rhythm. However, figurative intensity is almost unrelenting, so lines occasionally veer toward purple and repetition (“trembling,” “quaking,” vibrations) without new pressure, slightly dulling impact. Trimming a few redundancies would let the strongest images and rhythms land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus mood plus action), grammar is clean, and momentum generally holds despite rich description. Metaphors are imaginative and usually coherent (“forest fire trapped inside a seed,” “twisting stone intestines”), and paragraphing supports the scene’s shifts. However, figurative density is very high across much of the piece, especially in high-pressure beats, which edges into overwriting for a top-tier venue and occasionally feels like texture for its own sake. A modest trim of metaphor stacks and minor redundancies would sharpen impact without losing the distinctive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is rich and largely precise, with most metaphors pulling their weight and advancing both setting and theme (“scream lines,” “cello bowing the air itself”). Information density is high without much scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence contributes mood, world, or character. There is some risk of purple accumulation—multiple heavy images stacked in close succession—but it stops short of muddling clarity or numbing impact. Minor tightening of figurative clusters would elevate this to truly elite line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean for the density of ideas, rhythms vary, and most lines perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent—auroras, ley lines, structured code, chess formations—but largely coherent and on-theme rather than decorative noise. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum holds despite the reflective emphasis. The slightly purple tilt in places keeps it just short of top-tier minimalism, but it does not blur sense or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level prose is generally strong: sentences are varied, images are often fresh, and most lines carry both atmosphere and character. There is some density of metaphor and elevated diction, but it stops short of true purple prose and rarely obscures meaning. Minor repetition around “frequency,” “silence,” and philosophy verges on overstatement rather than deepening, yet momentum is preserved. With a light trim of the most expository or redundant phrases, this would be close to publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and mostly economical despite its lushness; sentences tend to carry multiple functions (world-building, character, and theme) without obvious padding. Sensory and figurative language are rich but generally controlled, and repetitions like “wildflower hush” work as purposeful echoes rather than artifacts. There’s a touch of purple at times (“turning of the tide’s thought,” “collective consciousness of the forest”) yet it fits the established lyric register and doesn’t obscure clarity or momentum. Line-level rhythm and syntax are varied enough to sustain engagement through a dense, descriptive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and apt, and key beats (“the whirling silence shattered, replaced by a harmonic chord that vibrated through her bones”) land cleanly. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic glitches, or clarity issues. The density of imagery comes close to saturation in places but does not meaningfully obscure action or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence structures, vivid but generally clear metaphors, and efficient interleaving of action with description. Almost every sentence does at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus theme), and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few lines verge on density or abstraction (“dynamic hazard map that changed by the hour”) but don’t obscure sense. The final paragraphs, in particular, have good rhythmic control and land the closure image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density and multi-functioning sentences that carry setting, mood, and concept simultaneously. Most metaphors are apt and mutually reinforcing, and the prose sustains a lyrical register without grammatical slips or confusion. That said, the density of figurative language edges toward excess in places and leans on a few repeated constructions (“sculpted hush,” “oscillating repose”), risking a mildly purple uniformity of texture. Even so, momentum remains intact and the closure image is clear and strong.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, interiority, and action) with decent concision, and grammar and sequencing are clean. There is a mild tendency toward stacked modifiers and metaphor density in the opening third (e.g., “graveyard of sound,” “suffocating stillness,” “avalanchingly quiet”) that risks purple, and a few near-redundant formulations of silence’s weight could be pared. Momentum remains intact, and the closure image lands clearly despite this ornamentation. Tightening a handful of overloaded phrases would lift the prose into a more rarefied band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density in most sentences and a good balance between image and clarity. Some metaphors are lush and borderline purple (“timeframe between vanishing stars,” “silence of a loud noise”), but they tend to be legible and thematically aligned rather than obscuring sense. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax shifts appropriately with pressure. Line-level craft supports, rather than competes with, the scene’s momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and most figurative language serves atmosphere. There is some purple and abstract phrasing (“trekking across the fade from memory to myth,” “chaotic, beautiful potential”) and a few near-redundant conceptual restatements, but they don’t obscure causality. Momentum mostly holds despite a slightly heavy middle of exposition about the relic’s nature and process. The final images are crisp and unblurred by metaphorical overload.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, most do multiple jobs (image + character + theme), and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. Figurative language is generally precise and apt (“architecture of their body language,” “geometry of sorrow”), and momentum is maintained despite the lyricism. The density of imagery flirts with purple prose in places, but not enough to obscure sense or dull the closure image. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with only minimal tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs and layered images that usually do more than one job (worldbuilding plus emotional charge). Sentences like “soil that tasted of lost years” or the “white noise of nothingness” are rich but still legible, and the syntax modulates well into the climax, where the loom’s deafening noise opposes the silence. There is some piling of figurative language in the first half that could be trimmed for an elite venue, but there are no real loops or scaffolding artifacts, and closure is crystal clear. Information density and momentum are both high for this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are generally tight, purposeful, and visually and sonically appealing; the prose carries both worldbuilding and momentum with good efficiency. Some metaphors are dense (“timeframe between understanding and confusion,” “theatrical whispers”) yet still coherent, and figurative language does not pile up to the point of obscuring sense. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic drumbeats that drag the line-level pace. For the very top tier, you’d want a touch more sharpness in a few abstract phrasings and perhaps one or two leaner, more muscular lines at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax and a strong ear for rhythm; imagery is generally fresh and purposeful. Occasional density of metaphor (“felt like turning a rushing river with her bare hands,” “negative space of history”) enhances rather than clutters. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and each sentence typically advances character, world, or pressure. The style is lush but remains clear even in peak beats, with no serious artifacts or muddled comparisons.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich but controlled imagery (“pressing against the glass, eager to reclaim the space that the light had stolen from them”) and good rhythm; most sentences do multiple jobs. There is a consistent metaphorical density, yet it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and the line-level clarity of action is maintained. A few spots verge on purple or slightly repetitive thematic framing (safety, darkness, solitude are reiterated in similar language), which modestly slows momentum. Tightening 2–3 abstract sentences would sharpen impact without losing the lyric quality.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: high information density, vivid but largely controlled figurative language, and minimal redundancy. Phrases like “the glass wick screamed with trapped radiance” and “a perfect darkness carved out of the blinding light” are striking and on-theme rather than gratuitous. There is some risk of purple prose, but metaphor vehicles remain coherent and don’t conflict, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. No significant scaffold, loops, or clarity issues interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and figurative language that is largely precise and purposeful. The prose carries multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, theme, character) without obvious loops or synonym churn. Phrases like “a sudden, expanding pulse of cyan pressure” and “iridescent caution” are striking yet clear, and the read-aloud rhythm is pleasingly varied. A few lines verge on overt exposition, but they do not significantly drag momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are mostly sharp, metaphors consistent, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases veer toward density (“psychic mortar of the tower’s foundation”), but they remain coherent and contribute to tone rather than obscuring action. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum through the buildup to the adjustment and the subsequent repair. The final image is clean, not dulled by ornament, and carries the accumulated weight of prior description.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is strong, imaginative, and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and function. However, figurative language is extremely dense, especially early, and some constructions (“atmosphere… shifted to a tone of bound release”) feel a bit abstract or self-conscious. There are minor redundancies in intensification but nothing that derails clarity. Tightening a few metaphors and pruning a couple of near-duplicate emphases would materially sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies well, and most lines carry multiple functions (setting, character, and theme) without feeling padded. Phrases like “aggressively public” and “enlarged tranquility” are fresh and apt, though the prose occasionally brushes against purple without tipping over. There’s little evident redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax remains clear even during more metaphorical passages. The closing paragraph in particular is clean and controlled, solidifying the piece’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically coherent (e.g., “the taste of ghosts,” “the slow fade,” “steam rising from a teacup” as absolution). There are a few slightly abstract or technical phrases that lightly disrupt the otherwise organic lyricism, but they do not harm clarity or momentum. No significant loops, syntactic monotony, or mixed metaphors undercut the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm varies effectively. Figurative language is frequent but internally coherent and on-theme, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess that would blur sense. Syntax and sequencing are clear, and there are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or copy errors that sap momentum. The density of imagery occasionally risks over-saturation but remains just on the controlled side of lush.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and action. Repetition is purposeful (the sequence of false starts) rather than artifact, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A few metaphors veer toward purple or redundant (“felt like a heavy wool blanket, scratching… yet shielding”), but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur meaning. Line-level clarity remains high through the climax, and the final paragraph lands with clean, controlled cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally efficient, and often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character in one). Imagery is lush but mostly precise, with synesthetic touches like “taste of static electricity” remaining clear rather than muddy. There’s little evident scaffolding or looped paraphrase, and the final image of her bioluminescence dimming as a cloud forms is both clean and charged. The only restraint is occasional density of metaphor in already-high-pressure moments, which edges toward purple without quite tipping into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere, emotion, and plot) and rhythm varies well. Some metaphoric density edges toward purple (“mournful violets and deep, bruising blues,” “auroral sorrow,” “a tangible sense of auroral sorrow that seemed to weep from the geology itself”), but it does not obscure clarity or causality. There are no serious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony. Slight trimming of modifiers could tighten momentum and lift this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tight, vivid, and largely free of redundancy; most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing plot, building world, embodying sensation). Figurative language is frequent but not over-stacked, and tends to be apt rather than purple; the closing beats are clear and charged. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and there are no conspicuous scaffold phrases or loops. Minor phrases (e.g., “overgrave streets”) risk opacity but do not materially obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and high-functioning, with rich but controlled imagery (“compressed archive of a time when the world was loud and wild”; “prismatic intensity”). Most sentences do more than one job—advancing action while worldbuilding or deepening theme—and the sequence of physical events remains clear despite the lyricism. There is some density of figurative language that edges toward purple in places, and occasional near-redundancies in restating the premise of sound disrupting consensus. Nonetheless, line-level craft sustains momentum and clarity, especially around the central kinetic process and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but largely economical: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and motion) without redundancy or muddled metaphor. Rhythm varies between long, image-rich lines and shorter, impact-focused ones, especially around the compression and release beats. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned with glass, pressure, and inversion rather than ornamental sprawl. I see no significant loops, scaffold phrases, or register jolts that sap momentum or obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (setting, character, and tension at once), and avoid redundancy. Figurative language (“sandstorm calm,” “cascading lanterns of purple light”) is frequent but not tangled or incoherent, and it generally sharpens rather than blurs. A few explanatory clauses—especially around the holographic will’s legal status and Elara’s motivation—edge toward telling what’s already dramatized. Overall, momentum and clarity hold, with only minor excess in explicit explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images do multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, character) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent (“as a spider spins its web” neatly captures process and tone), with no major muddles or mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and information density stays high without sacrificing clarity. At times the prose edges toward the ornate, but it does not significantly impede momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, vivid, and information-dense, with very few redundancies and a good balance of image and action. Metaphors like the salt crunching “like breaking bone” are sharp and apt, and the prose mostly avoids purple excess despite its richness. Momentum holds even through descriptive passages, and syntax modulates effectively at the climax. A few lines double up on similar tonal notes (“gleaming silence,” “quiet dark”) but not to the point of real drag.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, often doing multiple jobs at once (“natural world hijacked by a malevolent probability” efficiently carries plot, atmosphere, and concept). Some metaphor stacking (“terrestrially cosmic,” “tranquil blaze,” “blanket of stardust and geological weight”) edges toward purple and risks saturation, but core meaning stays clear and momentum mostly holds. There are no major loops or scaffolding sentences dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (e.g., meteors as “scratches on a developed negative”). Figurative language is dense but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or syntactic clutter, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Sentences carry momentum through the scene rather than bogging down in ornament. It’s high-level line craft that could only be marginally pared for even tighter impact.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and often striking, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and motion) and a strong ear for cadence. However, figurative density is high—nearly every sentence in some stretches carries metaphor or elevated phrasing—which occasionally veers toward purple and risks numbing the impact (“beautiful parasite,” “ghostly resolve,” “terrifying lightness of freedom” all crowd the same emotional register). There is minor conceptual redundancy around the garden as simulation and archive that could be tightened. These are refinements rather than fundamental flaws, but they do slightly dull momentum and keep the line-level craft below top-tier minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, vivid, and information-dense: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and action (“stalactites drip their slow, mineral tears” also reinforces the clock). Figurative language is frequent but largely disciplined, with metaphors that cohere tonally and rarely feel mixed or redundant. There’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase-looping; progression is steady and each paragraph advances either the operation or its emotional stakes. The only minor drawback is that the consistent high lyricism can slightly blunt the sense of immediate danger, but it does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding (“reed-blown melancholy,” “whispering seashell half…humming faintly with captured wind”). Figurative language is mostly coherent and controlled; repetition (webs, echoes, secrecy) reads as motif rather than artifact. A few lines verge on abstraction or redundancy (“webs of intrigue were dense here”) and could be sharpened, but they don’t materially slow momentum or obscure causality. Line-level craft is above average and close to publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density and a strong ear for cadence; most sentences do more than one job. However, metaphor and elevated language are used very frequently, sometimes drifting toward purple (“luminescence that felt ancient and stolen,” “psychic architecture of minds”) and slightly blurring immediacy. There are minor redundancies in phrasing but no serious loops or structural clutter. Trimming or sharpening a few figurative clusters would likely lift this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong imagery (“bioluminescent sparks that drifted…like stray embers from a celestial fire”) and generally clean rhythm and syntax. Sentences often carry multiple functions—world, character, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The density of figurative language is high, occasionally tipping toward over-embellishment (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity”) where simpler choices might sharpen impact. Nonetheless, clarity is never in doubt and the closure image is crisp, so any ornamental excess only slightly suppresses the score.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little redundancy, and the narrative flows smoothly. Some metaphors verge on familiar or slightly purple (“screaming with the fury of a dying planet,” “sprouted like fungus in the shadow of the apocalypse”) but do not accumulate to the point of drag. There are no notable loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues, and technical language is used cleanly. A bit more restraint and surprise in imagery could elevate this into truly standout prose.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and largely efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, mood, character), and rhythm feels intentional, with strong images such as the portico “vibrating with a sympathetic resonance that felt like the laughter of the storm.” Figurative density is high but generally coherent and pattern-consistent rather than muddled. There are mild instances of conceptual redundancy and abstraction (“his life’s work revolved to the rhythm of the thunder,” “violent and beautiful blooming”), which a very demanding editor might trim. Even so, clarity remains intact, and the closure image is clean and unblurred by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally precise and economical: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Imagery is vivid and largely coherent (“a golden speck of sound that refused to fade”), and the rhythm flexes appropriately between dense description and leaner action. There is a mild tendency toward purple phrasing and stacked modifiers, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum. No significant artifacts or redundancies interfere with the closure beat, keeping the prose comfortably in a publishable band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences generally carry multiple functions (image, mood, and information) and maintain clarity even with dense description. Metaphors like “color of old bruises” and the “severed finger” key are vivid and coherent, though the accumulation skirts heaviness in places. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; most lines move the scene forward in pressure or texture. A slight trim of modifiers and abstract formulations (“core concept of sonic absolution”) would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied in rhythm, and generally dense with information, often doing double-duty for mood and worldbuilding. The imagery—“restrained wildness,” “sound of metal screaming as it lost its invisible moorings”—is vivid and mostly controlled, with few if any mixed metaphors or redundancies. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or obscure causality; the action of the lever and collapse remains easy to follow. There is very little scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) and avoid redundancy, and rhythm varies nicely between longer atmospheric lines and shorter, declarative beats near decisions. Some metaphors verge on purple (“weeping wound of concrete and steel,” “scream of the past echoing against the indifference of the present geometry”), but they remain internally coherent and do not obscure sense. Exposition about the phenomenon and corporate pressures is compact and does not stall momentum. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length, image-rich but generally precise, and most metaphors are coherent and apt. Phrases like “eyes like polished gears” and “vibrant hush” do double duty for atmosphere and theme. The prose occasionally edges toward lush (“illuminating the dust motes… by the way light breaks through storm clouds”), but it stops short of purple and doesn’t stall momentum. There are no noticeable repetition loops or structural artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, yet most metaphors are coherent and purposeful, doing dual work for setting and theme (e.g., pistons “hissed prayers,” lightning as “jubilant fireworks”). Sentence rhythm varies well, and there are no real scaffolding loops or structural artifacts that bog momentum. At elite-publication standards, the density of figurative language skirts purple in places, which may slightly blur impact, but it never fully obscures sense or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, concise, and generally high-density: images like “the distinct and pressure-filled feeling of a billion voices having just fallen quiet” do multiple jobs at once. Metaphor use is frequent but rarely overwrought, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences move character, mood, or plot. Rhythm varies well, and syntax remains clear even in more figurative passages. A few phrases edge toward familiar SF-poetic (“vast, stagnant ocean of a social network archive”), but they don’t materially drag momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense but mostly purposeful; images like “gnarled apple trees twisted defiantly against the salt spray” and “boxes of unsent letters” do multiple jobs (world, mood, theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There are mild tendencies toward purple abstraction (“metaphysical structure,” “restored truth”) that could be tightened for maximal impact, yet they don’t obscure causality or closure. Overall, line-level craft is strong, polished, and publication-ready with only light trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and nearly every line advances either character or atmosphere. Metaphors are generally coherent and purposeful, though there is a mild tendency toward purple density (“surreal pocket of spacetime,” “desolate theater”) that risks over-saturation. There are no real scaffolding loops or clarity issues; causality and action remain legible. A light paring of modifiers and metaphor frequency in a few spots would lift this to a fully elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images are concrete (“rough like bark,” “a cage of autumn light”) and most sentences carry multiple loads of setting, mood, and character. The rhythm varies effectively, especially around the opening and closing beats. There is some purple/abstract phrasing—“creature of grief,” “rediscover her own validity,” “motivation to nurture intersubjective understanding”—that slightly blurs immediacy and feels editorial rather than fully voiced. Still, there are no major loops or muddled metaphors, and momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is controlled, with high information density: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus pressure or emotion). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and scene-appropriate, e.g., “with the careful gait of a man treading on sleeping vipers.” There’s no noticeable scaffolding, synonym loops, or template cadences, and rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum. A few slightly ornate formulations flirt with purple but don’t obstruct clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful imagery; sentences often do multiple jobs at once, advancing atmosphere, world, and theme. Lines like “The timeframe of the ritual was not measured in minutes or hours, but unfolded as vines climb” show controlled metaphor rather than clutter. There is a mild tendency toward conceptual repetition and explicit labeling (“motivation was singular and profound,” “core concept”), but it does not significantly impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often striking: “weathered innocence,” “a suspended hush, a physical weight of silence,” and the acoustic qualities of the room all carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, character). Sentences generally avoid redundancy and maintain forward momentum despite a descriptive density that edges toward purple only occasionally. Figurative language is frequent but coherent; metaphors tend to align rather than clash, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm from becoming mechanical. A bit of conceptual restatement in the final third slightly softens the impact, but not enough to materially dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, grammar solid, and images like “the collective sigh of a million captured moments slowly turning into white noise” balance clarity and resonance. Most lines do double duty (atmosphere plus theme or character), and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is a high density of figurative language, but the metaphors generally cohere and do not become muddled or contradictory, though the uniform lushness risks slight over-saturation. The piece maintains momentum appropriate to its lyric, accumulative mode without obvious loops or template cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and emotion (“a note of pure, luminous ache,” “the sigh of gravity accepting a burden”). Density of figurative language is high but mostly controlled, and I see little scaffolding or repetition. At times the accumulation edges toward purple, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (scene-setting, mood, interiority) with little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, and images like “gray woolen blanket of the world’s weather” or “a metronome for the soul” feel tonally unified. There is a mild tendency toward density—nearly every line is “turned,” which occasionally edges toward purple but doesn’t obstruct sense or momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the final sentence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, image-rich, and purposeful, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors like “tides against sand” and “a massive mechanism slumbering beneath the mosaic tiles” are clear and not over-mixed, and the prose sustains a consistent, slightly baroque lyricism without collapsing into purple. A few phrases repeat (“quietly deliberate,” various formulations of closing loops) and there’s occasional conceptual echo that could be trimmed for maximum sharpness, but these do not significantly drag momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, supporting clarity through the technical beats of operating the machine.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with meaning; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and characterization (“turn mistakes into constellations” is a strong, memorable line). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned, especially the bone-setting and splint motifs. There is some near-redundancy (splint metaphors appear twice, a few philosophical phrases echo) and moments of purple lean, which slightly dampen momentum. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) with relatively little scaffolding or redundancy, and syntax is varied without slipping into mechanical patterns. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent and legible—e.g., “protective ribcage of an ancient leviathan” and “crystallized ocean” reinforce the sea/creature motif rather than clashing. There are minor moments of over-lush or abstract phrasing (“atmosphere that felt like a zephyr bloom”) that soften immediacy, but they don’t materially harm closure. Overall momentum is maintained despite the lyric texture, with clear action tracking throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and cadence, many doing double duty for atmosphere and character without obvious padding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and non-muddled; key images (“honeyed hush,” “frantic blinking eyes,” “crystal daggers”) are vivid and internally consistent. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and action order is always clear. A slight tendency toward lushness in non-peak beats could be tightened, but it doesn’t impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is sophisticated, with high information density and multi-tasking images that typically advance atmosphere, character, and concept at once. There is a strong ear for rhythm and variation; clauses are balanced and the prose rarely stalls or loops. Some metaphors are stacked (“ink bled into gray vapor,” “gelatinous flow of the narrative arc,” “printing press of his mind”) in ways that edge toward purple, which slightly risks saturation. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved and key beats—including the extraction and final shell image—land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening atmosphere, and clarifying stakes. Figurative language (“cathedral of filtered light,” “spins golden stories into the misty air”) is vivid and mostly economical rather than piled-on purple, and syntax varies pleasantly. There are no discernible loops, scaffolding phrases, or template cadences that sap momentum, and grammar and sequencing are clean. A slight tendency toward lushness in multiple consecutive lines approaches, but does not cross, overwriting in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do more than one job at a time. The figurative language is mostly coherent and evocative, and there are no significant loops, scaffolding, or clarity breaks. There is a mild tendency toward lushness—piled modifiers and high concept metaphors (“static of the universe,” “refusals of the earth”) that risk purple but don’t quite tip into muddle. Tightening a few of those would make the already-polished surface feel even sharper and more inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a high information density—most lines do more than one job, advancing both atmosphere and idea. Figurative language is abundant but generally coherent and apt; phrases like “a sound like an inhaling lung” concretize the surreal. There is mild purple-prose risk in metaphor stacking (“vacuum for nostalgia, a cage for the intangible”; “store wonder in the cellar of reason”), but it doesn’t obscure clarity or closure. No evident loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are largely precise, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (bone, metal, water motifs), avoiding outright muddle. There is some risk of purple prose and occasional over-layering of metaphors (“whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush,” “transparent cage”) that could be trimmed for tautness, but clarity and momentum survive. No significant scaffolding, loops, or syntax glitches interfere with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do double duty by building atmosphere while advancing interior stakes. Figurative language is present but generally purposeful and not so dense as to muddy clarity; images like “mosaic of gray, rain-beaded” and grief flowing into the “cellulose lattice” are striking yet legible. There are very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases, and momentum through the internal ritual largely holds. A touch of adjective and metaphor stacking in a couple of spots hints toward purple but never quite tips over.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character), and generally avoid redundancy. Figurative language is dense but controlled, with most metaphors reinforcing the central motifs of stasis, machinery, and static. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph adds new pressure or texture. A few phrases flirt with purple (“bruising twilight,” “fractured horizon”) but they remain coherent within the established aesthetic and do not obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences are generally well-shaped, with good information density—most lines pull double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language (building as dying patient, maze of intentions, flows as currents) is coherent and not overstacked. A few abstractions (“radical reconfiguration,” “equations for hope”) lean slightly toward essayistic, but they don’t stall clarity or momentum. Rhythm holds up through the climax and final image with no obvious loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely precise and musical, with strong syntactic variety and high information density; many lines do double duty for worldbuilding and interiority (“air was frozen into a solid block of time”). There are moments of overwriting and cumulative metaphor where multiple high-intensity descriptors cluster (“glacial hush,” “solid block of time,” “viscosity”) and risk purple-ness, and a few near-redundant emotional statements could be trimmed without loss. Nonetheless, clarity and forward motion remain intact, especially in the approach to and contact with the crystals, and the final paragraphs land cleanly. Some light pruning and selective simplification around peak beats would elevate this to truly elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, theme), and rhythm varies effectively. A few metaphors and abstractions (“specific weight,” “serene upheaval,” “architecture of lies”) repeat enough to flirt with over-writing but remain coherent and purposeful. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase-loop, and clarity is never in doubt; a bit more pruning of explicit thematic explanation would make the prose feel even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: precise word choice, varied syntax, and very few redundant sentences. Several metaphors (“philosophical seed collector,” “dormant kernels of destiny”) are rich and coherent with the conceit. The density of figurative language occasionally edges toward purple, but clarity and momentum remain intact. With a touch of pruning, this would sit comfortably in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and well-chosen (silence as atmospheric pressure, the house inhaling, memory as amber). A few abstractions and conceptual phrases slightly blunt the immediacy compared to the best elite-level work, but they do not obscure sense or momentum. Rhythm and paragraphing support a gentle build to the closing image without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences are varied, concrete images carry weight, and figurative language is mostly apt and economical for the mode. Expository passages about the ancestors’ utopia verge on abstraction but still pull their weight by clarifying stakes and theme. There are no evident repetition loops, register jolts, or mixed metaphors that muddy closure; the final image is clear and potent. The prose is strong and publishable, if not yet dazzling in every line.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, generally clean grammar, and high information density with most lines doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character). Some metaphors flirt with purple or density (“violent marriage of magma and ocean tide,” “fractured piece of the night sky”), but they remain internally coherent and don’t obscure sense. There’s no obvious synonym-churn, looped paraphrasing, or template cadence that drags momentum. The overall effect is lush yet readable, just shy of the razor-precise restraint that would push it higher for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and information-dense, often doing worldbuilding, characterization, and mood work simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., “clotting the spiritual arteries… like calcified plaque”). There are no noticeable scaffold loops or redundancies, and syntax remains clear even in the densest passages. A few metaphors (“timeframe,” “sidereal patience”) skate close to conceptual heaviness but do not obstruct clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, images are often striking (“glow with a soft, bioluminescent phosphorescence”), and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffold. Most figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned with machinery and botany, enhancing rather than muddying sense. The prose balances density with forward motion, especially once he reaches the axle and engages the gear. A few abstractions and slight purple-leaning phrases could be trimmed for maximum tautness, but they don’t materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“Monarchs coated the glass panes like breathing rust”) and generally efficient sentences that advance atmosphere and theme together. Line-level rhythm is controlled, and there is little to no scaffolding or redundancy; almost every sentence earns its place. A few metaphors (“thundering calm,” “chamber of suspended amber”) risk purple density when stacked, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or momentum. Overall, the language would read as publication-ready with only very light pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and metaphorical yet largely controlled; most images (obsidian ridge mirroring a fractured soul, tactile Braille of regrets) are precise and thematically apt. Sentences carry multiple jobs—advancing action, character, and atmosphere—without much padding or repetition. The risk of purple prose is present but mostly avoided; a few phrases (“burning intensity of his focus,” “searing reverie”) flirt with overstatement but do not obscure clarity or closure. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum through the climax and into the quiet denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; nearly every sentence contributes to atmosphere, worldbuilding, or the central action. Metaphors are generally fresh and coherent, with only a few bordering on purple without undermining clarity. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the sequence of actions—timer stopping, thread work, object drop, reading—remains easy to track. Slight density and figurative stacking in the early lines keep it shy of absolute top-tier, but line-level craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally precise, varied, and information-dense, with most imagery serving both atmosphere and concept. There are a few stacked or familiar metaphors and abstractions (e.g., “display of absolute indifference,” “starless void above”) that verge on over-ornamentation, but they don’t obscure meaning or momentum. Redundancy is minimal; paragraphs mostly add new nuance or tighten pressure rather than circling. The final sentence lands cleanly and connects object, action, and theme without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; nearly every line advances setting, character, or stakes. Figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent, building a strong atmospheric texture without major muddle. That said, the density of metaphor and adjectives is consistently high, especially in early paragraphs, edging toward purple in places and risking minor saturation. Momentum survives this lushness, but a touch more spareness around peak beats would further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and varied, with most doing double duty for mood and information. Figurative language (“looks exactly how grief feels,” dust like “microscopic stars”) is apt and legible, not so piled-on as to become purple. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the piece moves forward with good momentum for such a contemplative scene. A few abstractions (“permanent sanctuary for her memories,” “mirage of safety”) could be grounded more in concrete perception, but they don’t materially slow or blur the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is dense and often striking, with high information content per sentence and effective integration of metaphor into action (“the mud pushed back with the weight of the ocean, a physical manifestation of the competing narratives”). Line-level clarity is generally strong despite the ornamented style, and there are few if any redundant loops. That said, the figurative intensity is near-constant, flirting with purple in places and leaving little negative space, which can slightly blunt impact. Trimming a handful of abstracted or heavily modified phrases would likely sharpen an already strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush but largely precise, with many sentences doing double duty in atmosphere and theme (“the room grew heavy with a pressure that was not emptiness, but the vibrating potential for sound”). Figurative language is frequent yet mostly clean and internally consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the progression of images has momentum. At times the density approaches purple, but it rarely blurs sense or dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is vivid and generally economical, with images that carry multiple jobs (e.g., the scent “reminiscent of first kisses, old libraries, and sudden grief” simultaneously building world, mood, and theme). Sentence rhythm varies nicely, and there’s little in the way of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative density is high but largely coherent, staying within the established palette of food, memory, and decay. A touch of purple remains in places, yet it doesn’t materially slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: rich imagery, good rhythm, and high information density with almost no scaffolding or repetition. A few phrases edge toward purple (“bruised apricot,” “heavy nectar dusk”) but the pattern is consistent enough to feel like a deliberate aesthetic, not excess. Syntax varies, and sentences often carry dual loads of setting and character insight (e.g., the sensory insult of Kael’s desperation). Line-level control is publishable, though not yet so razor-clean that every metaphor surprises and clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and the figurative language (“hushed blaze,” “calcified knot of scent”) is largely coherent and voice-true. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; description, thought, and action are integrated smoothly, and momentum is maintained despite a reflective mode. The metaphor load is high but patterned and thematically unified around silence, fire, and decay, which prevents it from tipping fully into purple. A touch more spareness in a few lines—especially the explanatory insight at the end—could heighten impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied, images often carry multiple layers of meaning, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. Metaphors (“silence louder than the groaning tides,” “blinding noon”) are vivid and generally coherent, with only occasional bordering on lushness without tipping into muddle. Pacing and syntax support scene momentum, especially around the archway revelation sequence. Minor density in figurative language is the only thing keeping this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and information. Phrases like “kinetic despair” and “texture of a missed opportunity” are striking and mostly controlled, though the density of figurative language edges toward purple in places. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase-looping, and action order is clear all the way through the rupture. A touch more pruning of abstract phrasing would heighten impact and keep every metaphor earning its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and world simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or opaque images. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy; the narrative flows without noticeable loops or filler. The slight leaning toward lushness never quite tips into purple, maintaining clarity through the climax and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (“rosewater dread,” “towering, frozen barricade of blue-white ice”) is vivid and mostly controlled, without mixed metaphors or real purple excess. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and momentum never stalls despite lush description. A small trimming of modifiers in a few spots could sharpen impact, but the prose is already near publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, vivid, and multi-functional, often advancing plot and atmosphere simultaneously. There is some density of figurative language, but it remains coherent and rarely tips into muddle or redundancy; phrasing like “film reel spun in reverse” efficiently clarifies a complex effect. Syntax has good variety, and there are no obvious grammatical slips or structural loops. For an elite tier, a slight trimming of stacked modifiers in places could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, strong sensory verbs, and sentences that carry multiple layers of action and mood. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically apt, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases that could be cut without loss. Rhythm varies well between longer, lush sentences and sharper beats at moments of pressure (“This was the bait, and it was lethal.”). A handful of stacked abstractions (“visual fabric of reality had been irreparably torn”) flirt with overstatement, but they don’t muddy causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images often carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and theme), and syntax tracks action cleanly. Some metaphors are arresting (“bruised plums,” “ocean breathed with a heavy, rhythmic chest”), though there is a high density of figurative language that sometimes risks purple prose and mild repetition (“bruised” recurs). Momentum is maintained well across the storm sequence, with few redundant scaffolding lines. The closure beat is clear and undulled by ornament, even if trimming a few lush descriptors could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is tight, with high information density: most lines carry worldbuilding, mood, and character at once. Figurative language is frequent but largely disciplined and thematically coherent (sun, bone, shell, machinery), avoiding mixed metaphors or obvious loops. Sentence rhythm supports momentum, quickening around the whistle and fissure while lingering just enough on key images (the gears, the steam). There are a few near-ornate moments, but they don’t stall clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, varied sentence structure, and largely efficient lines that do multiple jobs (setting, mood, theme) at once. Figurative language—the ivy as “green, leafy rust,” the rose petal as armistice clock, the train of history—is vivid and coherent, not muddled, and it culminates in a clear final image. There is some density of metaphor and elevated phrasing, but it remains legible and rarely feels purple or redundant. Minor tightening could prune a few explanatory clauses, yet there are no significant loops, scaffolds, or line-level artifacts that impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: sentences have varied rhythm, strong verbs, and efficient descriptive density, and there’s little dead scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is generally coherent and tied to tangible images (voids, stone, tides) rather than piling mixed metaphors. There is some tendency toward elevated abstraction (“emotional emptiness,” “hushed blaze of satisfaction”), but it mostly complements rather than obscures the concrete scene. Momentum remains steady despite the lyricism, with virtually no loops or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, precise, and information-dense; most lines do double duty with scene-setting and psychological shading. Vivid metaphors (“mechanical heartbeat,” “darkness became not merely an absence of light but a physical weight”) generally clarify rather than clutter. There is some tendency toward purple adornment (“dappled resolve hardening in his chest”) but it stops short of obscuring sense or momentum. Syntax and paragraphing support a clear build toward the click of the stamp and the turbine’s return without noticeable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but mostly efficient: images often carry multiple loads (world-building, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Syntax is varied and generally propulsive, with very few filler sentences. There is some stacking of figurative language (“world screaming in luminous torment,” “clock of metaphysics,” “blood acted as a binding agent”) that edges toward richness overload but does not obscure cause and effect. Tightening a handful of the densest metaphors would bring this to a top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences multitask—advancing plot, building world, and deepening emotion simultaneously—and the cadence varies well across the scene. Metaphoric density is high but generally coherent and on-theme (“a man carved out of the negative space,” “phantom limb of destiny”), with minimal redundancy. A few phrasings verge on purple or slightly mixed (“intangibly tangible,” “pure, arrested possibility”) but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closing image. There’s little scaffolding or looped paraphrase; momentum remains taut through to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, evocative yet largely disciplined imagery, and high information density with almost no scaffolding or loops. Metaphors are generally apt and concrete, with only occasional brushes against purple-prose territory that don’t materially harm clarity. The prose carries momentum cleanly from approach to climax to closure. A bit more restraint in piling figurative language into already-charged sentences could sharpen impact further, but current line work is well above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly lean yet rich, with few redundancies and a consistent, readable rhythm. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt; images like “the granulated silence of the deep” sharpen rather than blur sense. There is minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping, and the final image (“he carried the truth now, and it was heavier than any lie”) is clean and resonant. The density of metaphor occasionally edges toward purple, which at an elite standard trims the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and sensuous, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, mood, and character (“slick with the memory of a thousand torrential rains” effectively compresses weather, history, and tone). Sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum through the shift from contemplative setup to mechanical crisis. While the density of figurative language is high, metaphors are generally consistent and legible, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The only restraint on an even higher score is a slight tendency toward over-rich description that could be pared back in a few spots without losing effect.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and purposeful figurative language (loose halyard, stitching wounds with copper wire, man-made constellation). Sentences mostly avoid scaffolding or synonym loops, and each paragraph advances atmosphere, character, or decision. There is some repetition of key phrases/concepts (“backlash of regrets,” “merrily melancholic,” “expectations collapse”) and a mild tilt toward lyric excess, but it does not obscure clarity or dull the closure. Overall rhythm and concision support momentum despite the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and mostly efficient, often doing double duty with image and concept (“darkness that felt heavier than the sins Elias was trying to outrun”). Sentence rhythm varies nicely and momentum is maintained through the scene, with no major loops or scaffolding. There is a mild tendency toward purple or concept-stacking (“delicately robust,” “impossible ecosystem,” overt “labyrinth of choices”) that occasionally tells what the images already imply. These flourishes don’t obscure causality or the closure image, but trimming a few abstractions would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient: most sentences do double duty for setting and emotion, and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are mostly coherent and not over-mixed, even in peak beats, so the high figurative load doesn’t blur sense. Rhythm varies between long, sinuous sentences and shorter impacts in a way that tracks escalation. A handful of moments verge on purple but do not materially stall momentum or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and the prose has a strong ear when read aloud. Figurative language is rich but occasionally dense enough to verge on overwrought (“choking beauty,” “crushing magnificence,” “breathtaking and suffocating splendor”), stacking metaphors where fewer might have more punch. There is little scaffolding or repetition; each paragraph advances pressure or reweights prior imagery. Mild overwriting in descriptive beats, rather than any true muddle or loop, is the main limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and information-dense—images like the magnetized needle slipping through “metaphysical space” or crystallized tear-trails are striking and clear. Sentences do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and action) without much scaffolding or repetition. The density of figurative language occasionally edges toward purple but stays controlled and legible. There are no notable loops, mixed metaphors, or mechanical errors that sap momentum or blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, varied in syntax, and information-dense; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or causal stakes. Metaphors are mostly coherent and imaginative, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is some risk of over-saturation in figurative language in a few stretches, but it does not obscure clarity or the closure image. A slight pruning of the most decorative comparisons would further sharpen propulsion for elite-journal standards.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and action) and rhythm varies well. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned, with few mixed metaphors or obvious scaffolds. Information density is high without major redundancy, and key beats are shown rather than summarized. The ornate style could be dialed back slightly in peak-pressure moments to sharpen urgency, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Imagery is vivid yet largely precise, and there are few to no paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. The density of metaphor is high, but the comparisons stay thematically aligned (friction, vectors, slide, dawn) and do not materially impede clarity, including at the closure beat. A slight trimming of modifiers in early paragraphs could sharpen momentum, but the line-level craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned (ink as suppression, scars as geography, storm as revelation), and there are no real clarity issues. That said, figurative language is very dense—often multiple metaphors per paragraph—flirting with purple and leaving little room to breathe. Trimming a few intensifiers and mythic comparisons (“fury of a rejected god”) would heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, vivid yet controlled imagery, and high information density with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and thematically aligned (e.g., parry as rebuttal, riposte as counter-argument), avoiding mixed metaphors. Action sequences remain legible despite lyricism, and there are no major loops or template cadences. A few phrases lean toward ornament (“scent of ozone and epiphany”), but they do not obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have rhythmic variation, dense imagery, and generally do multiple jobs at once (world, mood, character). Phrases like “luminous fracture” and “violet bruise of the atmosphere” are striking without often becoming muddled or mixed. A couple of moments skirt purple or redundancy (e.g., explicitly spelling out the rebellion’s “core concept”) but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure clarity. The final paragraph in particular is clean, compressed, and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry plot, setting, and tone simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, supporting rather than obscuring sense (“tides were vast currents of cumulonimbus”). There are no obvious loops, redundancies, or syntactic ruts, and grammar and sequencing are clean. A few phrases flirt with purple (“steely longing,” “victorious sorrow”), but they are well-placed and do not dull the clarity or cadence of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and typically do double duty advancing atmosphere and stakes. Figuration is often striking (“air was thick and bruised purple,” “crystallized wish”) and mostly coherent. However, metaphor density is consistently high, occasionally veering toward purple (“seductive trap of nostalgia for a lie that promised eternal comfort”), which risks blurring rather than sharpening a few beats. There is little scaffolding or looping, but a touch more restraint would increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: figurative language is rich but mostly coherent, and sentences often carry atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotion simultaneously. Phrases like “cerulean regret” and “frequency of his forgiveness” lean purple but fit the established lyricism and do not obscure clarity. There is little redundancy or scaffolding; the prose moves steadily toward the ritual’s culmination without padding. A hair more restraint in metaphor stacking at a couple of points could elevate this further into truly exceptional territory.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and dense, though a recurring "He [verb]" sentence structure in the final paragraphs creates a slightly repetitive cadence. The phrase "pointless beauty" leans toward cliché, but the surrounding imagery remains sharp and functionally drives the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Momentum is stalled by passive constructions ("She was currently existing in the fragile timeframe") and anticipatory scaffolding ("The method of her discovery would rely on") that tells rather than shows the process. These prose artifacts dilute the otherwise sharp sensory details and weaken the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is descriptive but suffers from high metaphor density ("tomb of ice," "cacophony of desperate colors," "open like a mouth"). The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("indelible muscle memory," "violent overturning") slows the rhythm and pushes the style toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally evocative but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("crushing impossibility," "crushing quiet," "impossible spaces," "impossible geometry") and adjectival density. The simile "like a whale dying in a cathedral" is striking but verges on purple. Line-level momentum is maintained, though the density of "as if" and "felt like" constructions drags slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but heavily reliant on stock metaphors and clichés ("silence... like a physical weight," "patience of water," "treacherous goat paths"). These familiar phrases flatten the texture, preventing the imagery from achieving the sharpness required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally competent but suffers from some mixed metaphors (calling tripod knobs "brass knuckles" creates confusing, violent imagery) and overwrought description ("forensic need," "solidified mercy"). The density is adequate, but the reliance on adjectives to carry the mood slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density ("supple, glowing tendrils," "jagged, luminescent object"), which slows the rhythm and creates a "scaffolded" feel. Key internal states are often told via exposition ("Elian was driven by...") rather than revealed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but relies on several clichés (e.g., "Dust motes danced," "fluid precision"). The phrase "completing the organic circuit" is a mixed metaphor that blurs the mechanical action of the lock, though the overall readability remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and evocative, with high information density in descriptions like the "Ashen Forge." However, the immediacy is dampened by filter verbs and interior reporting ("Elara knew that," "She saw," "She watched") during the climax, where direct sensory experience would have heightened the impact. A few phrasings lean toward the adjectival ("lush, desperate explosion"), but the rhythm is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally evocative and rich, but marred by noticeable unforced repetitions (e.g., "heavy leather satchel" and "heavy crystal vessel" in the same sentence; "metaphysical" used twice as a descriptor). These echoes distract from otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally evocative but suffers from occasional overwriting and pathetic fallacy ("weeping" landscape, "defiant orange beast"). Adverb-heavy dialogue tags ("proclaimed gravely") and label-like descriptions ("thoughtfully spirited") detract slightly from the otherwise strong line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought with dense adjectival phrasing ("transformative betrayal," "tetanus-laced walls"). The description of "ghostly indentations" and the decoding process is high-quality, precise observation that balances the heavier exposition earlier in the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is evocative and dense, successfully conveying the weight of the moment. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("shrieked," "screaming," "drowning ember") or mixed metaphorical imagery (silence having "veins of regret"), which muddies the clarity of the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor deductions for occasional adverbs ("softly," "remarkably") and slightly expository phrasing ("functioned remarkably like curiosity") that slows the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but heavily reliant on scaffold sentences that explicitly label significance ("This was his secret method," "This was his confession," "Tonight, his motivation was..."). These constructions stall momentum and tell the reader what to feel rather than showing the scene unfolding. While the rhythm is generally good, the density of these explanatory bridges weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("knuckles as gnarled as the dormant wisteria"). However, the climax suffers slightly from over-explanation ("confusing the sensors that looked for metaphysical luck rather than simple physics"), which dilutes the power of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "statues of frosted glass" and "Sunday that hadn't happened yet." The rhythm supports the tension of the experiment, and there is a commendable lack of scaffolding or repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors ("stillness was a lock... force the tumblers with kinetic energy"). Phrases like "chemical composition that dry air could never release" feel like pseudo-scientific filler that clashes with the magical tone. A layer of "telling" (explaining the ghost's will) weakens the "showing" of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("bruised green light," "jagged algorithm") that advances the tone without stalling momentum. The sentence structures vary purposefully to control pacing, particularly during the tactile climax of smudging the paper, though the opening paragraph is slightly heavy on adjectival modification.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose relies heavily on telling where showing is needed, particularly regarding character traits ("religiously skeptical") and motivation. Adjective-heavy descriptions ("heavy warmth," "crumbling industrial graves") occasionally clutter the sentence rhythm and slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract phrasing ("geometric vessel of transition," "regenerative silence") that tells rather than shows. Several prompt phrases appear to be pasted directly into the text ("Across the drift of untold seasons"), creating slight rhythmic stumbles where the authorial hand becomes visible.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional and rhythmic but marred by clichés ("spaces between the notes," "dull as river stones") and mixed metaphors ("rising tide of cautious exuberance"). The "old local journals" sentence creates a noticeable exposition lump that drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is descriptive but frequently stumbles into scaffolding and telling ("Being sensitively perceptive to the echoes of trauma, he felt..."). Phrases like "gait as uneven as the timeline" feel strained, and the repetition of "bronze quiet" acts as a static label rather than a developing motif. The reliance on participial openers to deliver character traits weakens the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from several "telling" artifacts and expository lumps that disrupt momentum. Phrases like "core concept of open secrets," "deep-seated motivation now was," and "realized with sudden clarity" are scaffold sentences that explain rather than show. The final paragraph tilts toward purple prose ("language of pure luminance") that distracts from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    Strong imagery ("clear syrup," "lattice of words") is intermittently undercut by explanatory telling (e.g., "Kellen knew he had to act," "motivation was to illuminate"). These abstract summaries distance the reader from the immediate physical action of the exorcism.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains striking imagery ("fossilized Nautilus shell," "paused breath"), but is marred by a clear grammatical break ("before exhaustion hits" inside a past-tense sequence) and some overwrought phrasing ("calcified echo of the golden ratio"). These artifacts drag on momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("blooming, stone flower"), but occasionally leans on scaffold phrases ("To the untrained eye") or slightly jarring register shifts ("algorithmic randomization" next to ancient runes). While the clash fits the concept, smoother integration of the technical terms into the protagonist's internal lexicon would elevate the flow. Rhythm and pacing during the climax are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is marred by frequent stock phrases ("silent sentinels," "abyss," "biting chill," "emotional dam") and adjectival stacking. These artifacts flatten the otherwise unique imagery and reduce the immediacy of the sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "echoing like wind chimes in a gale" that serves the tone well. Sentence variety supports the pacing, accelerating appropriately during the climb. There are no significant line-level artifacts or scaffolding issues, though some prompt phrases are inserted a bit stiffly.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is often striking ("tears gleaming like drops of mercury"), but a distraction arises from the "dust-coated coat" echo. Crucially, the register drift in the climax ("core concept... slammed into her") disrupts the immersion of the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose has strong moments of imagery but suffers from abstract telling and filter verbs ("He felt," "He realized," "He understood"). Phrases like "ethically playful demeanor" are clunky artifacts that reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is competent but weighed down by expository clunkiness ("specifically the time after...") and adjective-heavy descriptions. Telling significantly outweighs showing in key character beats, particularly regarding Elara’s perception and motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from a persistent tic of adjective pairing ("precise and practiced," "rich, honeyed," "heavy, chaotic," "sad, knowing," "glassy, serene") that creates a repetitive, lulling cadence. Filter verbs ("Silas felt," "Silas watched") distance the reader from the immediacy of the sensory experience. These artifacts dull the precision of an otherwise competent style.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("knuckles white," "melting into pure, unguarded relief," "radiant enough to rival the constellations"). These stock phrases reduce the impact of the imagery and give the writing a generic texture that obscures the unique situation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from specific artifacts, including the cliché "shadows pooled like spilled ink" and the telling label "boldly sympathetic." There is a tendency toward adjective-noun stacking ("profound silence," "unforgiving glass") that slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is functional and propulsive, handling density well, but suffers from several stock phrases ("purple shadows," "suspended... like diamonds," "frantic precision"). While clarity is high, the reliance on these familiar descriptors limits the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery ("grinding teeth," "silver sap"), though it occasionally slips into abstract phrasing ("gelatinous uncertainty"). The rhythm supports the ritual's pacing, delivering a polished surface texture.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally evocative and rhythmically controlled, though phrases like "entropy of rot and neglect" verge on redundant modification. The "sapphire hush" reprise frames the narrative effectively, tracking the restoration of order. A few filter-like constructions ("tried to bleed through") slightly distance the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric with strong imagery ("bruised olive"). The climax relies on filter verbs ("realized," "understood") to convey the internal shift, which slightly distances the reader at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is strong ("twisted rebar met calcified coral"), but the prose suffers from adjective stacking and direct telling ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe"). Filter verbs dilute the immediacy of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is overwritten, characterized by adjective-noun stuffing ("symphonic resonance," "grand linear tapestry," "geological memory") that creates abstraction. The climax relies on a list of generic images (dew, bread, holding hands) that lacks the specific, idiosyncratic texture required for the highest literary echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract telling ("landscape of navigated absences") that substitutes conceptual labels for concrete imagery. Several sentences function as scaffolding for the author's ideas rather than immersing the reader in the scene's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("drifting like breath in winter"). There are minor instances of clichéd phrasing ("panic that warred with her resolve") and slightly purple descriptors ("metaphysical locus"), but momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwritten ("gentle reverence," "chaotic instruments") and relies on adjective-noun pairings. The phrase "cognitive resonance was empirically undeniable" is clunky, diagnostic jargon that breaks the emotional immersion of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from adjective stacking ("relentless, grinding," "heavy, suppressed") and moments of telling ("sound that was not auditory but emotional") that distance the reader. Clichés like "terrible beauty" flatten the impact of the finale.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from purple patches ("paradoxical tone of deathly vitality," "frantic pulse") and adjective stacking. While functional, the reliance on abstract nouns ("silence," "candor," "balance") weakens the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective density and occasional overwriting ("chaotic interference," "incandescent restraint," "rigorously dictated"). While the imagery is strong, the reliance on modifier-heavy phrases sometimes slows the momentum and distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("peeled and curling like a dead leaf") that supports the tone. There is a tendency toward slight overwriting and adjective stacking ("cold, heavy intent"), which occasionally slows momentum without adding necessary information density.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is dense and often evocative ("friction of something incomplete"), but the reliance on summary for the climactic beats ("He spoke of his fear...") blunts the impact. The phrase "manic grin" is a stock gesture that reduces the specificity of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("loomed like a judgment," "orchestrating a massive urban ballet"). While generally strong, it occasionally leans into summary for internal states ("fierce need to navigate gentrification") rather than dramatizing the feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Imagery is often strong ("cerulean fluid," "gnawing teeth-ache"), but the prose suffers from a distinct usage error ("heavyset" used as a verb) and some stock phrasing ("sprawling testament"), which detracts from the polished feel.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but relies on several stock phrases ("stillness of a statue," "beating heart," "swirling gray chaos") that dull the imagery's impact. The technical description of the repair is the sharpest writing, while the emotional beats feel more conventional.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative ("geometry felt like a polite suggestion"), driving the narrative with strong rhythm. However, minor artifacts like the intensifier in "totally devoid of awe" and the slightly generic "silence of a falling stone" simile detract slightly from the otherwise high polish.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from heavy modification and purple phrasing ("transient percussion of their transit," "possessing a quality of wild hush"). Filter verbs ("Silas knew," "Silas felt") and telling ("Infinitely patient," "precision of a maestro") dilute the immediacy of the action, creating a layer of scaffolding between the reader and the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is descriptive but suffers from adjective/adverb density ("sucked greedily," "creep ominously") that occasionally slows momentum. The noted tense shifts ("touches," "runs") are mechanical flaws that mar the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten ("heavy, metallic stillness that felt like copperlight repose"). While the flow is good, some moments rely on abstract descriptions of the magic system rather than concrete sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but leans on telling and adjectival stacking ("terrifyingly beautiful," "heartbreaking joy"). Phrases like "pure light" and "cold as the grave" are generic, and the climax suffers from abstract summarization instead of concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is overwritten with a heavy reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("jagged rim," "somnambulant grace," "ghostly efficiency"), creating a dense, purple texture that drags on momentum. This stylistic artifact distances the reader from the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally strong and atmospheric ("slow, botanical embrace"), though it occasionally leans into cliché ("stitching a wound," "silent sentinels"). The rhythm is controlled, but the density of adjectives and interpretative phrasing slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and philosophical intrusions (e.g., "temporal purgatory," "ritualistic geometry") that stall momentum. While imagery is vivid, the density of adjectives and "telling" sentences creates a drag on the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("time is just a loop of thread"), but occasional melodramatic verb choices ("hissed," "booming") and slightly purple phrasing ("decaying scent of ending cycles") prevent a higher score. The rhythm and density are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but relies on several clichés ("heart hammering against his ribs," "tears tracking") and scaffold phrases like "As if on cue." The density of figurative language in the dialogue ("glue of a time," "debris of your pride") feels overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and abstraction. Metaphors are sometimes mixed or heavy-handed ("palimpsest," "jagged line that looked like a scar"). The reliance on abstract summaries of action ("unknot the tightness," "graft new meaning") reduces the line-level impact of the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose relies on telling over showing, notably in the mechanical application of the prompt ("applied the core concept of exposed film"). "Smiled inextricably" is a usage error (likely meant "inexplicably" or "wryly"). Sentence structures are functional but lack propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong phrasing like "chemical certainty" and "bloomed through reflected sound." A few standard images, such as the world cracking "like an eggshell," detract slightly from the otherwise fresh imagery. The pacing within the 600-800 word constraint is efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally competent with some strong imagery ("sharp, rhythmic throbbing"), but suffers from adjectival clutter ("biological chaotic noise," "unadulterated nonsense") that slows momentum. Some phrasing feels overly constructed for effect ("precisely as punctual," "candidly cryptic") rather than natural, creating a slight barrier to immersion during high-tension beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from modifier congestion and mixed metaphors that clash with the tone, such as introducing "toxic isotope" and "half-life" into a fantasy setting. Phrases like "shyly unstoppable" and "trembling reverence" rely on weak adjective-adverb pairings that dilute the imagery. The final image of "cool, blue waves of contentment" is a generic descriptor that lacks the specificity of the earlier shell imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from adjectival density ("gently systematic," "dull, gray pulse") that slows the read. The definition of "foxglove regret" in the text disrupts the scene's immediacy, reading more like an authorial note than a character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from high modifier density, with nearly every noun paired with an adjective ("volatile magical energy," "chaotic knot," "jagged strand," "cautious exuberance"). This creates a breathless, slightly repetitive rhythm that clutters the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    While functional, the prose suffers from overwriting and adverbial clutter (e.g., "slyly heartfelt precision," "dappled resolve," "violently," "obsessively"). These phrasings reduce impact and create a dense, slightly purple texture that drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally evocative, but the insertion of the required phrase "timeframe across learning to trust again" creates a significant syntactic stumble that disrupts the rhythm. The description occasionally leans toward the purple ("paradoxical perfume"), but the technical descriptions of the dust and bird balance the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense and generally effective, with strong imagery ("shards of refracted light"). However, some phrasing leans purple ("jagged shards of quiet," "screaming nerve"). The required phrase "featherly determined" reads as awkward and unidiomatic, disrupting the otherwise smooth rhythmic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but marred by mixed metaphors ("rough texture of failure") and awkward integration of prompt phrases ("movement that was softly ingenious"). These artifacts disrupt the otherwise smooth flow.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is often overwritten with adjective-heavy clusters ("perfect, cheerful gloom," "delightfully morbid curiosity"). Phrasing is occasionally clunky and passive, specifically: "The method of her next discovery arrived via the scattered seeds..."

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose flows well but relies on several clichés ("silence of a ghost," "bloom like a rare flower," "cut through the gloom") that dull the imagery. Some "explain-everything" narration during the chain reaction reduces the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but leans toward purple descriptions and expository shortcuts, such as the sentence "This phenomenon meant the verse was no longer a foreign addition..." which explains the magic mechanics directly to the reader. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("delicate glass stylus," "singular moonstone cabochon") slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished with high information density ("prism atrium... waiting to shatter"); however, the reliance on filter verbs at the climax ("He sought guidance," "The water told him") dampens the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is overly dense with figurative language ("kissed him too deeply," "breathed like a living dragon"), slowing momentum. The saturation of adjectives and metaphors triggers the density penalty, obscuring the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from density issues and "purple" descriptors ("serene upheaval," "paradox typical of this place"). The reliance on adjectives and abstract nouns to convey the magic system slows the momentum. The rhythm is somewhat monotonous, lacking the variation needed to heighten the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is functional but marred by redundancy ("sensitively perceptive" is a tautology) and adverbial crutches ("miraculously preserved"). These artifacts signal a lack of trust in the dramatization to convey the character's nature or the object's state.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but prone to "telling" abstract states (e.g., "perceptively calm," "singular, crushing failure") rather than showing them. Some phrasing ("delicate acoustic suspension") feels clinical against the fantasy backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is overwritten and heavy with adjectives and similes ("dragging their long shadows like wounded beasts," "grating like rusted gears"). The text relies on "purple" phrasing ("swallowing the moonlight," "slicing through the tension") that obscures clarity and reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm is strong and information density is high ("white scar," "jagged, tessellated cartography"). However, a reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("fractured grace," "phantom flock") occasionally pushes the prose into overwrought territory.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose features strong imagery ("spilled ink on a blank page," "breaking cello string"). Some word choices feel slightly clinical or clunky ("timeframe," "unadulterated"), and there is a tendency toward adverb-heavy descriptions ("fluid and deliberate," "slowly," "instantly") that softens the impact of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose features strong visual imagery, particularly the reversal described as "wet ink sucked back into the nib," but is weighed down by abstract telling ("shadowy, ambiguous understanding"). Occasional clichés ("wind taken out of his sails") and heavy phrasing ("meteor hush") detract from the otherwise precise descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the technical description of the knot is excellent, the prose is frequently overwritten with heavy-handed personification (clouds with "breath that refused to release," "embarrassed pink"). These poetic excesses clutter the line level and obscure the sharper, more grounded reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.5)
    Sentence structure is highly repetitive, with a pervasive "He [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" pattern that creates a monotonous rhythm (e.g., "He approached," "Elias worked," "He did not," "Elias shielded," "He moved," "He poured"). The prose suffers from "telling" emotions via adjective-heavy labels instead of showing them through physical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery, though occasional adjective stacking ("violent purple and heavy lead") and expository phrasing ("possessed a cognitive curse known as") slow the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("glowing vectors," "obsidian floor"). However, several moments of expository telling ("It was empirically ironic," "unnecessary emotion") disrupt the immediacy and reduce the emotional impact of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense with adjectival clutter ("dangerous contradictions," "complex deceptions," "microscopic tragedy") that tells rather than shows. Key moments are summarized in abstract terms ("initiated the transfer," "commune directly with his blood") rather than rendered through concrete, immediate sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("rippled like molten silica"). There are minor instances of "telling" abstract concepts ("core concept of his alchemy was erasing boundaries") that could have been shown through the action itself, but the line-level rhythm is generally excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the imagery is strong, the prose is hampered by the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("using forgotten bag contents," "endearingly feisty woman") which reads as scaffold. Additionally, there is some reliance on weak modifiers ("whirring softly," "utterly devoid") and slightly clichéd phrasings ("creaking frame").

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("ocean of ink"). A few phrasings border on self-conscious ("auditory punctuation," "radiance that felt suspiciously like radiation"), but the rhythm generally supports the tension. The "turning pages" image effectively bridges the physical and meta-fictional layers.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally high-density and atmospheric, with strong phrasings like "metabolized the ink." A few moments of adjectival stacking ("damp, sorrowful gloom") and the telling-not-showing of "carefully resourceful" slightly mar an otherwise polished and propulsive style.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the imagery is often striking, the prose suffers from persistent filtering ("acutely aware," "felt the timeframe") and telling ("bordering on madness") that flattens impact. The reliance on explanation over dramatization in key moments holds back the literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally polished but relies on abstract modifiers like "warmly methodical" and "clear complexity" instead of concrete showing. These descriptors flatten the action, though the overall rhythm and clarity remain competent.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is evocative with strong verbs ("scoured," "drowned") and specific imagery ("jagged lightning made of neon wire"). Rhythm is generally good, though occasional adjective triads ("heavy, final, and earned") slightly drag the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjective stacking and occasional clichés ("shaking the marrow," "lance of pure, white brilliance"). Some phrasing feels overwritten ("retrocognitively blessed, cursed"), choosing elaborate description over efficient, active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric ("cauterized the parchment"), but suffers from occasional expository density ("rare and chemically complex"). Phrases like "auditory hallucination was the raw material" tell rather than show, slightly stalling the otherwise strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with strong sensory imagery ("crushing the scent of wild thyme"). It occasionally leans into heavy metaphor ("sky above had forgotten how to hold them"), but the density generally supports the atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rich, with strong imagery like the "fractured eye" of the ceiling. It occasionally leans into purple territory ("final, sharp consonant... refusing to settle," "texture of time") and abstract metaphor strings that distance the reader slightly from the immediate physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from redundancy ("impossible miracle") and clunky modifier clusters ("disturbingly intangibly tangible") that impede flow. Over-reliance on adverbs and standard personification ("jealous grip") dilutes the otherwise vivid imagery; the line-level craft needs tightening to match the conceptual ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but occasionally dense with explanatory scaffolding ("It served to catalyze a phase shift..."). There is a reliance on "telling" at key moments ("Elian knew he had to act," "proving once again that"), which distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from heavy adjective stuffing ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "magnificent curtain," "oil-slick rainbows"), which clogs the rhythm. Modifiers are often stacked rather than selected for precision, reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is competent but leans toward "purple" description ("velvet sky," "gasping desperation," "spectral silver"). There is a reliance on adjective-heavy telling of emotions ("agony," "liberation") rather than conveying them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("thunderclap inside a glass jar"), driving the scene's intensity. However, reliance on some familiar pairings like "ozone and petrichor" and the slightly melodramatic personification of the force keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory density (&quot;bones grinding&quot;), though there is a tendency toward heavy adjective stacking (&quot;massive, horn-rimmed acoustic device&quot;). The phrase &quot;lactic fire&quot; creates a minor register clash with the story&#039;s otherwise archaic/steampunk tone.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally evocative ("breaking of a bone") but suffers from occasional heavy-handed modification ("patina of solitude"). The insertion of the prompt element "as reality shifts" creates a jarring tense break ("time was now as reality shifts") that disrupts the line-level flow.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and dense but suffers from adjective-noun stacking ("fluorescent hum," "relentless friction," "trembling hand") and some clichéd phrasing ("screamed of a father"). The "fluorescent hum" opener is a standard workshop trope that lacks the freshness of the subsequent dust imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from template cadence in the climactic paragraph ("She descended... She waded... She reached... She jammed... She turned..."). Occasional mixed or cliché metaphors ("suffocating blanket") detract from the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("jagged cathedral," "weeping steel"), but it occasionally leans into adjectival density. The primary weakness is the use of expository scaffolding ("Elias’s motivation was singular," "This was the threat") which tells rather than shows. These declaratives flatten the tension during the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clean and competent, with clear imagery ("sound like a breaking icicle"). However, reliance on weak emotional labeling ("mossy delight") and standard descriptors ("precious seed," "gentle prod") prevents the line-level craft from reaching higher bands of evocative density.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is functional but suffers from stock phrasing ("instinct that bypassed his intellect," "screaming silently") and the awkward adjectival pairing required by the prompt ("uncertainly certain"). These artifacts dull the immediacy of the high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and heavy modification ("luminous regret," "factually mystical," "specific ionic residue"). The density often comes from abstract explanation rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is often vivid ("debris than music"), but the prose occasionally leans into abstraction or purple phrasing ("gravity of self-imposed seriousness," "luminous ache"). Sentence structures are functional but repetitive, often relying on simple "Subject-Verb" openers that create a staccato rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is dense and effective ("varnish from a raw nerve"), driving the scene's intensity. There is a slight tendency toward adjective stacking ("sickly, vibrant hum"), but the prose maintains strong rhythm and momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is functional and clear, but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("emotional resonance," "metaphysical surgery") or standard description ("storm-tossed ocean") rather than fresh, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery like "bringing down the darkness from the attic." There is a slight tendency toward modifier-heavy phrasing ("claustrophobic confines," "faint, translucent figures") that could be tightened to increase propulsion, but the line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("snapshot of a gunshot," "kissed the glass"), but suffers from abstract telling ("terrifying solidity of consequence," "chaos was a masterpiece") and occasional stock phrasing ("swirling sea of clouds"). These artifacts dampen the immediacy of the action, keeping the reader observing the philosophy rather than experiencing the physical rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, largely avoiding technical flaws, though it leans heavily on adjectival stacking ("swirling, luminous chronology"). The framing use of "burnished sorrow" works as a structural device, though the phrasing itself is somewhat melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is competent but suffers from adjective/adverb stacking ("hesitant, terrified rhythm," "peculiar, judgmental attribute," "glowing violently"). There are moments of "purple" overwriting where metaphorical density obscures the physical action, reducing the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from abstract telling at pivotal moments, notably describing the reaction as "instantaneous and metaphysical," which flattens the climax into a label. Over-modification ("harsh dismissal," "specific geography") and a reliance on summary ("descent was treacherous") rob the scene of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés ("screamed with the fury of a banshee," "testament to survival") and abstract phrasing. The sentence declaring Elara's motivation reads like a prompt insertion artifact rather than organic narrative thought.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from filter verbs and telling ("realizing," "had to reckon," "seemed to"). The pacing drags slightly in the middle due to past-perfect summary ("had spent," "had salvaged"). The imagery is vivid, but the reliance on explanatory sentences dampens the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is serviceable but marred by tautologies ("hovered motionlessly," "physical stone") and some melodramatic phrasing ("tears evaporating instantly," "unintelligible shreds"). The rhythm is generally steady, but the reliance on adjective-noun pairings creates a dense, slightly heavy texture that slows momentum without adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose often achieves strong density and rhythm ("paradox of glass," "violent, swirling gold"), technical slips mar the execution. The abrupt shift to present tense in the character exposition ("inherently rejects") disrupts the timeline, and phrases like "successfully managed" create redundancy (pleonasm). Some early exposition relies on telling rather than immediate scene immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory grounding ("curled like a dead leaf"). The repetition of "velvet disquiet" at the end functions effectively as a framing device that recontextualizes the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagery anchors the scene ("forced the dust to remember"), but the prose tends to over-explain the mechanics of the magic ("not creating energy, but organizing it"). These expository layers drag on the momentum during the high-stakes action beat.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose has a steady rhythm, but line-level filters ("he realized with a sudden clarity") and clichés ("fluid motion," "not with a bang") dull the immediacy. The "sudden clarity" moment is a classic "tell" of internal state that would be stronger if shown through action or sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting, frequently relying on "adjective + noun" pairings ("cold luminescence," "brilliant violence") and clichés ("velvet void," "sleeping panther"). These artifacts create a dense, flowery texture that obscures the action and slows narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose features strong, dense imagery ("visual screaming," "petrified honeycomb"). However, a significant cliché at the climax ("let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding") and a reliance on filter verbs ("He noticed," "He understood") in the mid-section mar the otherwise polished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("twisted... like a tree root that had grown through concrete"). The score is held back by filter verbs in pivotal moments ("Elara realized," "She understood now") which distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    Reliance on adverbs ("usually," "carefully," "warmly," "unexpectedly") weakens the prose's muscularity. Direct telling ("imperfect and breathtaking") supplants showing at the climax, distancing the reader from the visual impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by heavy telling ("His specific motivation was...") and cliché transitions ("Weeks bled into months"). These artifacts flatten the narrative momentum and replace active scene work with explanatory summary.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong images like the "bruised purple sky" and "faint, pale rhythm of light." There is a slight tendency toward adjective-heavy descriptions ("heavy, metallic silence"), but the density generally supports the atmospheric weight. No major artifacts impede the flow, though the repetition of the phrase "bronze quiet" is noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival density and occasional over-modification that slows the rhythm ("opaque, oily water," "spectral and vibrant"). The phrase "narrow vastness" is used twice, creating a repetitive lexical loop that draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense and descriptive, with strong specific imagery ("amber gaze," "flickering diode"). However, some metaphorical stacking ("belly of this metallic beast," "spinning ghost") clutters the reading line. A few filter verbs ("He realized," "He knew") distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from filter verbs ("seemed to," "looked as though," "realized") that distance the reader. Some phrasing leans toward overwriting ("god had taken a wet brush," "ghosts of conversations"), reducing impact through ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from clunky integration of prompt elements, most notably the awkward phrasing "specifically a pocket sundial lid," which halts momentum to name the object. There is a tendency toward oxymoronic or vague descriptors ("cautious abandon," "blinding roar") and adjective-heavy constructions that clutter the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality phrasing like "texture of false catastrophe" and "distinguish between a script and a scar." The line-level craft supports the story’s solemnity without dragging. There are no visible artifacts or scaffold loops; the rhythm moves effectively from the repetitive walking to the sharp crack of the kings.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.2)
    Verbatim prompt insertion causes distinct mechanical errors: the repetition of "occupying" in the first paragraph ("occupying the... bookstore occupying") and a tense mismatch ("lay... and substitutes"). Additionally, phrases like "distinctly not paper" and "performed the action with... reverence" rely on filtering and adverbial telling.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is competent with moments of strong imagery, but suffers from inserted prompt phrases ("fidgets productively," "fierce repose") that disrupt the rhythm. The phrase "smelled of ozone and regret" is a mixed-metaphor artifact that weakens the sensory line.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains striking imagery but is marred by adjective stacking ("bleak, calcified," "complex, beautiful") and register drift. Phrases like "multiphasic truth" and "monochrome solemnity" feel abstract or technical, clashing with the fable-like tone. There is a tendency to use weak subjects ("the action began to refract") that dilutes sentence-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric but occasionally veers into overwriting ("marrow of her mind"). The insertion of the phrase "kintsugi intentions" feels clunky and prompt-driven rather than organic to the character's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is functional and rhythmic but suffers from occasional overwriting ("preternaturally still," "concave surface"). The phrasing sometimes prioritizes poetic sounding abstractions ("superstition made manifest") over concrete grounding. Line-level momentum is steady, but the "holographic" descriptor is a notable artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sensory imagery is vivid, but the prose leans toward melodrama ("agonizing care," "clawing solicitude") and repeats the phrase "screaming tenderness." The mechanics of the magic are delivered through heavy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is weighed down by stock metaphors ("mute testament," "weeping silence") and clashing imagery ("swollen like a bruised ocean"). While the sensory descriptions of the machine and censer are tactile, the tendency toward abstraction ("silence... heavier than steel beams") weakens the opening. The density of adjectives slows the pacing without always adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "fractured grace" and "lens of darkness." Rhythm is controlled and propels the narrative. Minor phrasing clichés ("relentless winds," "impending rain") prevent a higher score, but the final line ties the metaphor back to the character's identity beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose acts as a scaffold but suffers from adjective stacking ("triple-lens," "swirling," "iridescent") and abstract phrasing ("psychological debris of human sentiment"). Phrases like "burning motivation" read as cliché. The density of modifiers occasionally slows momentum without adding necessary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level momentum is strong, and information density is high. However, the prose occasionally relies on stock metaphors and clichés ("freezing vice," "panic began to claw," "fevered delirium") that diminish the impact of the otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally lush and evocative ("ribcage of blue ice"), but suffers from minor register slips like "simple biological light" (clinical) and clunky phrasing ("aging intricate-clockwork artificer"). These artifacts slightly disrupt the mythic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished but occasionally relies on abstract telling over concrete showing (e.g., "gravitational emotional weight," "frequency of departure"). While the imagery is often strong ("distinct grains of sand"), the reliance on "label-speak" for emotional states prevents higher immersion. The rhythm is good, maintaining momentum through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and metaphors, occasionally drifting into "purple" territory ("velvet texture of the mind," "pale and peeling like sunburned flesh"). The use of stock phrases like "ozone tang" and "liquid starlight" detracts from the literary quality. The reliance on filter verbs and internal summary slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rich and sensory ("polyphonic dripping," "copper tang"), but occasionally dense with explanations that slow momentum. There is a tendency to bridge beats with thematic summary rather than letting the action speak, particularly in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft suffers from clichés ("panic fluttered... like a trapped bird") and filter verbs ("She realized," "She understood") that distance the reader. Adjective stacking and expository sentence structures ("These mineral deposits were...") reduce narrative density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Imagery is often vivid ("lignin and neglect," "burn mark of frost"), but the density of similes ("rusty needle," "pistol crack," "blocked pipe") occasionally clogs the rhythm. A lighter touch on the figurative language would improve propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional and clear but suffers from adjective stacking and slightly purple phrasing ("stagnant death rattle," "violent temporal spasm"). Some descriptions, like "cutting... like a diamond scratching against glass," lean on clichés. The sentence rhythm is steady but lacks the variation needed to heighten tension during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose has strong rhythm and striking imagery ("rotted into an obsession," "strangled the wind"). However, the climax relies on a cluster of filter verbs and cognitive scaffolding ("He realized with horror," "He finally understood," "He thought desperately") that weakens the line-level impact of the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is competent and occasionally evocative ("soft exhalation that rattled the plastic sheeting"), but suffers from overwriting and abstract phrasing ("quintessential familiar strangers," "innate precision"). Several sentences function as telling summaries ("For decades, Elias had built walls") rather than active scene construction. The pacing is smooth, though the "technobabble" climax feels stylistically thinner than the descriptive buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract telling ("profound sense of peace," "undeniable truth") and some purple phrasing. These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level mechanics are functional, but the prose is marred by several clichés and purple abstractions ("impossible geometry," "pregnant with potential," "bleeding arteries") that reduce the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, though occasionally dense with adjectives and slightly "purple" phrasing ("violet sky bruised," "haunted euphoria"). The description of the ink and the tactile manipulation of the stone are standouts in clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is functional but suffers from adjective-noun pairing habits ("crushing silence," "desperately jocular," "weary hope"). The phrase "clattered indistinguishably among the earthly gravel" is rhythmically clunky and over-modified.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from adjectival clutter and stock phrasing ("tears she could not see," "cosmic clockwork"). The density of metaphorical descriptors ("frantic syntax," "acoustic labyrinth," "quiet blaze") sometimes slows momentum without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from a usage error ("callous" used as a noun instead of "callus") and a tendency toward abstraction ("nutrition of wisdom"). Similes are frequent ("like DNA," "like vellum," "like a purring cat"), creating a slight density issue that slows momentum without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    Repetitive subject-verb sentence openers ("He stood," "He began," "He panned") create a monotonous rhythm. Abstract phrasing ("notation of energy") and oxymoronic cliches ("joyful sorrow") dilute the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    The phrase "volcanic tenderness" repeats verbatim in the climax, creating a noticeable text loop that detracts from the emotional peak. Additionally, the phrase "analytically intuitive" is a clunky modifier stack that tells rather than shows, momentarily breaking the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of adjective-noun pairings ("delicate calibration," "fragile blueprint," "synthetic foliage"), creating a repetitive, dragging rhythm. While the imagery is inventive, the reliance on modifiers over strong verbs and the tendency toward purple phrasing ("velvet night," "shimmering atmosphere") weaken the impact of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and propulsive, with strong imagery that supports the tone. Action beats are clear, and the description of the technical/magical elements (the key, the map) is handled with good economy and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose struggles with overwriting and mixed metaphors ("vibrated with a stillwater tension"). Phrases like "internal abyss" and "crushing weight of her guilt" are melodramatic clichés that flatten the emotional impact. The integration of required phrases feels clumsy, disrupting the rhythm with awkward adverbs ("spiralingly calm").

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the imagery is colorful, the prose suffers from scaffolding artifacts ("proceeded to cradle") and clichés ("trembling hand"). Hyperbole like "infinite complexity" and heavy adjectival stacking reduce line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose relies on adverbs and stock phrases ("impotent fury," "inexorable rising," "swirling aggressively") which dampen the impact. Some moments veer into "telling" ("peculiar magic that unlocks guarded hearts") rather than evocative description.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic ("scythed across the roof," "drift to the floor like a shed skin"), creating a vivid sensory experience. A few moments of dense adjectival stacking and the aforementioned tendency toward explanatory abstraction ("survivalist erasure of love") slightly reduce the immediacy of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the imagery is imaginative, the prose suffers from heavy modification (Adjective-Adjective-Noun strings like "dimming, slate-grey veil," "overwhelming, jagged truth") and adverbial clustering ("entirely, and selfishly, specifically," "merely," "solely"). Filter verbs ("Then it hit her," "She knew") distance the reader from the climax, summarizing the epiphany rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally evocative with high density ("vitrified soil," "sound like falling icicles"). The score is held back by the tell-y phrasing of the "innocently cunning strategy" line, which feels like a scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but heavily reliant on stock phrasing ("groaned open," "weighing heavily," "hollow ache," "crumpling into disappointment"). These clichés reduce the texture of the writing, making the emotional beats feel standard rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory density in the workshop descriptions. Occasional phrases like "ocean of grief" and "specific heartache" lean into cliché, and the phrasing "embodying the role" tells rather than shows, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The phrase "steadily curious" is repeated verbatim, creating a distracting prose artifact. Some sensory descriptions ("acrid, metallic tang," "pulse hammer") rely on stock phrasing that dulls the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by adjective stacking ("glittering, suspension-held atoms," "pure, unadulterated sentimentality") and stock phrasing ("laughed and sobbed simultaneously"). The description of the dance is the strongest writing, while the emotional beats lean on abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("tumbler," "obsidian-like geode"), but suffers from "telling" emotional resonance ("emotional resonance vibrated... deep chord of finality") and consistent filtering. These artifacts blunt the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("bedrock of trust," "shattered by a charming smile," "infinite care") and abstract phrasing ("wreckage of his deception"). While the flow is smooth, the lack of fresh linguistic choices dampens the impact. The "shedding" metaphor is repeated to the point of redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose features strong conceptual imagery ("ghost of time," "payload of Genesis-level vitality"), but suffers from occasional clunky phrasing like "explicitly fusing." Some descriptions feel slightly overwritten ("screaming protest"), reducing the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and evocative with high information density. Minor overwriting appears in modifier stacks ("unnaturally spatially imaginative"), but the rhythm generally supports the rising atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from modifier stacking ("singular and terrified," "frantic, desperate") and cliché ("Time was a flat circle"). Reliance on filter verbs ("He felt," "realizing that") and abstract nouns distances the reader from the physical action, reducing immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.3)
    The opening line ("silence was not empty... holding its breath") relies on a worn cliché. While there are strong images, the prose suffers from abstract telling ("simulate the miracle," "volatile, sleeping histories") and some overwrought adjective-noun pairings ("violent, gasping shudder").

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.3)
    While there are moments of strong imagery ("polished bronze," "bioluminescent bulbs"), the prose often leans into abstraction and overwriting ("tone of probable miracles," "frequency of his own epiphany"). These artifacts dilute the scene's immediacy and weaken the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose has moments of beauty but suffers from adverb reliance ("violently," "softly," "bitterly," "gently") that dulls the action. Some imagery leans toward the pathetic fallacy ("accusatory in the distance") or purple abstraction ("cadence... like a shoreline lullaby") rather than precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with standout imagery like "fingertips... dipped repeatedly into molten glass." The rhythm supports the ascent. Minor "telling" phrases ("paradoxical sensation," "terrifying significance") occasionally dilute the otherwise strong showing, but the line-level craft is generally excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally evocative but occasionally stumbles into strained metaphors and clichés, such as "dark as a bruised ego" or "scent of bureaucracy." These abstractions detract from the otherwise concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés in pivotal beats. "Fingers flew across the terminal" reduces the climax's labor to a stock gesture, and "the force of a rogue wave" is a tired metaphor that dulls the impact of the revelation. These artifacts in high-pressure moments undercut the otherwise competent density.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is readable but marred by stock phrasing ("ragtag," "suffocating lull," "jagged slice"). Adjectival stacking ("colossal hangar doors," "stagnant," "silent and deliberate") slows momentum without adding fresh specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but repetitive in structure, relying heavily on "It was..." definitions to explain story elements ("It was the vessel," "It was the tail," "It was a method"). This expository scaffolding drags on the pacing and reduces the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rhythmic and sensory ("fragile lung of greenery"), but marred by occasional "telling" artifacts and clinical register ("somatic markers," "quietly talented," "tactile ruin"). These abstractions create a layer of distance in what should be immediate, visceral moments. The "quietly talented" sentence acts as a resume summary rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    While evocative, the prose suffers from significant "purple" overwriting and abstract genitive metaphors ("palette of grief," "texture of failure," "neon sorrow"). These constructions blur the physical sense of the scene, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over concrete immediacy, which is a barrier to the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and dense. A few phrasings drift into stock territory ("howled like a dying god," "blur of threat") or slightly heavy modification ("pale, pigment-free skin"). Rhythm and clarity are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival density ("dizzying quiet," "trembling gloved hand," "omnipresent algorithmic censors"). The integration of the required phrase "bravely conflicted" results in a "tell" that momentarily flattens the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is weighed down by noun stacks ("ragged piece of airship ballast sandbag scrap") and overwrought phrasing ("microscopic tremble," "chaotic vibrations"). Adjectives and adverbs often clutter sentences rather than sharpening the image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from adjective stacking (e.g., "resinous heavy frequencies," "predatory, drowsy hum") which occasionally slows momentum. Despite this, the imagery is vivid and the sentence-level logic remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("voice like tearing paper"), though a few phrases lean slightly purple ("dangerously malleable"). The line-level craft effectively supports the elevated tone, maintaining density and momentum without significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative and flows well, though it occasionally relies on adverbs ("solely," "specifically," "fiercely") and slightly heavy modifiers. Some descriptions, like "physics of the moment collapsed," lack the freshness of the specific imagery found elsewhere, such as the ink-stained fingers on the console.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Momentum is generally good, but the prose suffers from clichés ("suffocating quilt") and register drift ("feedback loop," "acoustic nexus"). The heavy use of adjectives slows the reading without always adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Imagery is generally vivid and dense ("rime of a nuclear winter," "violet and black"), establishing a strong atmosphere. The score is held back by a few instances of adjectival clutter and abstract metaphors ("mocked the darkness," "cradle empathy") that distance the reader slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and grammatically clean but suffers from frequent overwriting and heavy metaphor density ("silence usually tasted like cold, bitter ash," "acrid smoke of despair"). The reliance on filter verbs ("Barnaby saw," "he felt") and adjectival stacking slows the narrative momentum in service of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is evocative ("digital glass," "ribbons of luminance"), though occasionally dense with modifiers. The phrase "visceral, physical feedback" is a minor tautology that drags the rhythm slightly in an otherwise tight sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("air tasted of salt and ionized iron"), though occasionally overwritten ("swirling aurora of grief"). The pacing is controlled. No major technical flaws, though the exposition of the fossil's psychological purpose slows momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose contains moments of ingenuity (the button metaphor) but is weighed down by clichés ("dancer's grace," "tangled knot of fears") and abstract summaries ("Possibility flooded the warehouse"). The reliance on "telling" in key emotional beats dampens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from a repetitive "adjective, adjective noun" cadence (suffocating endless mist, profound silver hush, precise aching moment). Reliance on adverbs (wetly, violently) and the clunky phrasing of "prudently daring" reduce the immediacy and precision of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.1)
    Verbatim repetition of unique phrases ("spindrift serenity," "rain gutters stop ticking") in the opening and closing paragraphs creates a mechanical, looped effect. The prose tends toward adjectival density ("heavy, confused obscurement") that slows momentum without adding sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("skeletal remains," "accumulated misery") and mixed metaphors ("phototropic to kindness") that obscure clarity for the sake of sounding profound. The simile "as chimney smoke flattens" halts momentum and feels syntactically awkward within the sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic. Score limited by explicit "telling" of required elements (e.g., describing an expression as "wistfully pragmatic" and the atmosphere as a "quivering hush") instead of showing these qualities.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by register drift; mixing "damp scrolls" with "quantum perfection" breaks the established tone. Phrasing occasionally leans into melodrama ("lungs seizing," "vertigo of her own history") where concrete detail would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and readable, but suffers from adjective stacking ("small, intricate object," "perfect, calcified helix") and abstract phrasing ("physical weight of peace"). The line-level craft is competent but often prioritizes ornamentation over narrative momentum or concrete causality.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose has moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("He [verb]" patterns dominate the action beats) that create a mechanical rhythm. There is a tendency toward overwriting and adjective piling ("frantic, rhythmic precision," "confused, heavy lethargy") and self-congratulatory telling ("perfect distillation of ethereal grit") that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is functional and clear with some strong images ("suspended in amber"). However, the score is limited by reliance on stock phrasing and clichés ("heart hammered against her ribs," "marrow of her bones," "washed over her") during peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the imagery is often vivid, modifier bloat ("very methodical precision," "effectively sculpting") and overwrought abstraction ("mimicking the reflection of a soul") dull the prose. The writing occasionally tells rather than shows, reducing the immediacy of the physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Heavy reliance on adverbs and adjective stacking ("fervently believed," "carefully retrieved," "shuddered violently") weakens the prose. These artifacts pad the sentences and blunt the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from explanatory scaffolding ("Here was the method," "This was the specific timeframe," "Because of this..."). These sentences bridge gaps in showing, slowing momentum and distancing the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("asphalt veins," "ghosts of the circus"), maintaining a strong rhythm throughout the descriptive passages. Momentum stalls slightly during the summarized sections, and a few phrases ("manic energy," "predatory acquisition") lean on stock descriptions, but the line-level craft remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.9)
    Imagery is often strong ("light expanding... like a breathing lung"), but the prose suffers from scaffold sentences ("Her motivation was consuming and specific") and RPG-like descriptors ("she possessed a specific attribute") that break immersion. These artifacts clutter the narrative flow and reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose alternates between strong, dense imagery ("vines, red as arterial blood") and clunky, scaffolded exposition ("This catastrophe was the violent aftermath..."). Phrases like "churning maw of impossibility" lean into cliché, and the expository bridges disrupt the rhythmic momentum of the action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is functional but marred by a visible spelling error ("dessicated") and wordy constructions ("expression defined by a gaze that was purposefully curious"). Clichéd phrasing ("threatened to make his knees buckle") and abstract noun clusters reduce the impact of the stronger imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    While generally strong, the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction or slightly heavy metaphor ("surgical theater for the metaphysical," "tenderness of a mother"). These moments slightly blunt the immediacy of the otherwise visceral action.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally dense and propulsive, with high-quality technical description ("Bleached warp, unbleached weft"). A few metaphors in peak beats ("gaping, hungry thing," "tourniquet for his anxiety") border on overwriting, slightly distracting from the scene's physical immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("cradle of spun glass," "throat clearing to speak"). The sentence rhythm supports the contemplative yet urgent tone. A few phrases feel slightly expository in the opening, but the line-level craft is otherwise polished and supports the "high-concept" atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is atmospheric with strong imagery ("copper tang of regret"), but relies on filter verbs ("Elian knew," "He felt") and summary during the climax. These line-level choices dilute the immediacy of the smelting process, turning action into observation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with adjective-noun clichés ("chemical tang," "frigid air," "latent radiance") and scaffolded transitions ("The decisive shift occurred during..."). The reliance on abstract summaries of emotion dulls the impact of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has strong rhythmic moments ("crinkling like an old lung"), but is marred by a typo ("unclapsed") at a pivotal moment. Additionally, relies on stock phrasing ("crushing embrace," "indifferent sea") and melodrama ("singing his necessary apology") that dilutes the scene's raw power.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies on clichés ("precipice of the unknown," "heart hammered") and abstract telling ("felt a rush of triumph") that dilute impact. Adverbs weaken the action ("furiously," "instantly"), and the prose often explains the concepts ("It was a method of cheating time") rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, utilizing strong imagery like the "moth-eaten" timeline to visualize abstract concepts. The phrase "caffeine-rich sludge" clashes slightly with the established atmospheric tone, but the overall rhythm is propulsive and free of scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished and readable but suffers from adjectival density and occasional clinical jars like "necrose" that clash with the poetic register. Strong sensory details like the "smell of old paper" are undermined by some filter verbs ("She was not looking... but listening," "she detected") that dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but adorned with frequent adjective-noun pairings ("committed caretaker," "luminous, pulsing essences") that slow momentum. The phrase "kindly decisive" reads as a clumsy prompt insertion that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with good momentum and imagery ("embers... surrendered"). Some descriptors lean toward the melodramatic ("chaotic orchestra," "monolith of conviction"), but the line-level craft is competent.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("clumsiness of a falling branch"). Minor issues include filter verbs ("He realized," "Elara saw") and some abstract phrasing ("vast and labyrinthine") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from adjectival clutter and clichéd constructions ("weathered resolve was etched into the deep, leathered lines," "testament to a lifetime"). While the rhythm generally supports the action, these stock phrases dampen the immediacy and freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally competent with good rhythm and density. However, there are minor artifacts of overwriting, such as the oxymoron "visual silence that screamed," which feels strained. The transition "Logic dictated... However..." is a functional scaffolding that disrupts the immersive flow of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from adjective stacking ("desperate, heart-wrenching reality") and abstract metaphors ("burning with orange hope") that muddy clarity. Phrasing like "wandering purposefully" reads as oxymoronic and slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery ("money of ghosts," "jagged rhythm"), but suffers from a reliance on "It was..." constructions to define concepts and emotions. This tendency to summarize significance ("It was a beautiful, tragic archive") tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the feeling through the description itself.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans heavily on abstract nouns to explain the magic ("Using the ambient grief... he began to crystallize"). This "telling" of the mechanics robs the climax of visceral immediacy; the writing is smooth but occasionally lacks concrete density.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.1)
    Imagery is evocative ("sound like a plucked violin string"), but the prose suffers from modifier density ("undeniably," "decidedly," "earnestly") in the opening that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and readable but relies on some stock imagery ("skeletons of roofs," "ghosts of joy") and mixed metaphors ("festered into a stain"). The sentence rhythm is steady but lacks the propulsive variation needed to heighten the low-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is technically competent but suffers from significant overwriting and adjective-heavy scaffold ("jagged teardrop," "humid warmth," "stoic rationalism"). The density of modification slows the momentum and feels decorative rather than urgent, particularly in the description of the magical process.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose rhythm is generally solid, but the text relies on several stock constructions ("panic threatened to strangle," "mask of professional detachment," "scream... to his fingertips") that dull the impact. The insertion of the prompt phrase "attentively inventive" feels awkward and adverb-heavy, disrupting the otherwise concrete description of the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is functional but relies on abstraction to convey action, blurring the line between metaphor and physical reality ("vibrating the tectonic plates of their floating arena"). Phrases like "narrative weight... evaporated" tell the reader how to interpret the moment rather than showing the event itself.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on several worn clichés ("liquid clarity," "tumbler falling into place," "not with a bang") which dilute the freshness of the imagery. Sentence rhythm is controlled but lacks variation in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but occasionally overwritten ("nadir of existence," "recursive geometry"). The insertion of the prompt phrase "master the core concept of tending to the unspoken" is syntactically clunky and disrupts the rhythm. "Macerate" is effectively used but appears twice in close proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is rich and dense ("solidified silence," "tasted like ozone"), creating a strong immersive experience with high information density. While the phrase "interiorizing exteriors" is a bit jargon-heavy and clunky, the rest of the line-level craft is polished. Imagery is prioritized over exposition, keeping the narrative momentum steady.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from adjective stacking ("tremulous, gloved hands," "heavy, ornate instrument") and abstract telling ("profound tragedy," "stifling destiny"). These artifacts reduce information density and slow momentum, creating a melodramatic rather than visceral effect.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("skeleton of abandoned radio towers"). There is a tendency toward modifier stacking ("jagged, heavy," "vibrant and pregnant") which occasionally drags on the rhythm, but the imagery of the "shard of hush" is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on adverbs ("resiliently," "violently," "accusingly," "steadily") and abstract nominalizations. The explanation of the climax ("synthesized from the sound waves") reads like pseudoscientific jargon rather than narrative description.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong sensory details like the "wetness that never quite dried." The imagery of the "violent unfolding of space" is handled with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally evocative ("steady, indifferent fire"), but marred by occasional clunky phrasing like "balancedly curious" and "dense, encrypted library." The exposition regarding the Visitors is efficient but disrupts the scene's immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from filter verbs ("She could feel," "realizing") and cliché phrasing ("weight of a thousand unsaid goodbyes"). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is dense and propulsive, with strong information density in the descriptions of the facility. There is a reliance on some phrasing clichés ("panic clawed at his throat," "silence rushed back"), but the rhythm generally supports the tension well. The action sequences are clear and visually distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is readable and rhythmic but marred by a high density of clichés ("bitter pill of wisdom," "path of least resistance," "fool's errand," "purgatory of unanswered questions"). These stock idioms reduce the literary freshness and impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmic ("grinding, resonant hum") but suffers from some overwriting and reliance on abstract intensifiers ("physically slice," "sheer density"). The use of "Suddenly" to transition to the birds' arrival is a minor structural weakness that disrupts the otherwise smooth flow.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Imagery is often vivid ("antenna bent like a broken finger," "butterflies made of light"). However, the prose suffers from occasional filter verbs ("Elias felt") and abstract phrasing ("tenuous threads of reality") that distance the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally functional with some striking imagery, but it is marred by clunky, expository phrasing (e.g., "specifically those of rebellion or riot," "core concept of breaking free"). These artifacts read like prompt-checking rather than immersive fiction, stalling momentum at critical junctures.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. A few abstract phrases ("cognitive paradox") and heavy adjectival clusters ("violent, beautiful gray") clutter the line level, but the imagery generally lands with precision and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    While evocative, the prose leans heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("serpentine ruin," "specific luminosity," "sordid magic") which slows momentum. The sentence structures in the opening (repeated "He was," "He did") create a slight scaffold effect that dampens the rhythm before the action accelerates.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and imaginative ("specific gravity of heartbreak," "ozone tang of the void"). The metaphor density is high but fits the genre and POV perfectly. Line-level propulsion is strong, with no visible scaffolding or repetitive sentence structures to drag the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally strong with evocative phrasing, though marred by occasional filter verbs and telling ("She did not intend to keep"). Some descriptions lean toward purple ("hush of improbable beginnings"), but the technical description of the light-painting process is handled with clarity and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is technically polished but heavy with abstractions ("raw entropy," "nebulous color," "cosmic possibility") that obscure concrete imagery. Several mixed metaphors and "purple" descriptors (e.g., "unassumingly bold") reduce the impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and visually rich, though it suffers from some "telling" artifacts ("possessed a chronically curious mind") that distance the reader. Imagery is strong ("crown of thorns"), but the density of adjectives sometimes slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is sharp and dense, with strong phrasing like "geometry of conflict" and "caught in glass." The pacing is well-managed, accelerating appropriately at the climax. A few phrases lean toward the abstract or purple ("glittering explosion of reversible destiny"), but the line-level craft generally supports the story's tension well.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and adjective stacking ("perpetual, radiant hush," "tiny kernel," "pulsating object"). Clichés ("calloused palm," "drab place," "budding hope") and mixed metaphors ("genetic code of magic") weaken the imagery, making the style feel decorative rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lush and textured, though it occasionally tilts into adjective-heavy modification ("fractured porcelain," "cold needles," "psychic shriek"). The use of "gordian knot" to describe a knot he successfully unties (rather than cuts) is a precise lexical error regarding the allusion, which dings the craft score.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is competent and clear, with strong specific imagery ("ragged edge," "erased by the relentless Scottish drizzle"). Momentum is occasionally slowed by adjective stacking ("grainy, grayscale," "dark, dry") and expository bridging, but line-level craft is generally solid.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose flows well but occasionally veers into hyperbolic or mixed metaphor ("silence was heavy enough to break bone," "spiderwebs made of lead") that strains credibility. These artifacts distract from the otherwise strong imagery, though the technical descriptions of the "psychic" work are generally handled with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line-level quality is uneven; strong images clash with redundant phrasing ("encode his message through messages encoded") and passive constructions ("keeping him in a state of being driftingly alert"). The climax relies on abstract telling ("raw data of their shared history") rather than concrete sensory action, weakening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but marred by reliance on adjective-adverb pairings ("warmly inquisitive," "gentle precision") and stock phrasing ("gibberish to the naked eye," "rhythm or reason"). High-register abstractions ("kaleidoscope of refracted luminance") occasionally clutter the imagery without adding narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("undulating like oil on water"), though it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("detonation of pure white light"). The rhythm supports the contemplative mood, maintaining momentum despite the lack of physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong rhythm and imagery ("pendulum of pure geometry"). There is a slight tendency toward modifier density and abstract phrasing ("heightened stillness," "divine mathematics") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Some phrases lean toward purple ("violet bruise," "profound sense"), and the description of the "core concept... revealed itself" is slightly heavy-handed telling. Overall, the line-level craft supports the ethereal tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative and image-rich, with strong control over rhythm and description. There is a tendency toward adjectival density ("profound driftwood nostalgia," "delicate pick," "sharp scent") that occasionally slows momentum, but the line-level craft is generally high quality and free of distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically competent, but suffers from occasional overwriting and metaphor clutter. The pacing is steady, though the heavy use of summary in the opening ("Years had passed...") delays the scene's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose contains evocative moments but suffers from prompt-echo artifacts, most notably repeating the phrase "beautifully flawed" verbatim in the final sentence. Some phrasing leans toward purple ("precipice of the end of days") or cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the opening image is strong, the prose suffers from telling ("terrified figures," "graceless beauty") and some clunky filtering ("He knew he had to act"). Adverb-heavy phrasings ("offhandedly exact," "snapped cleanly," "banked sharply") weaken the verb choices in key action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and descriptive, though occasionally modifier-heavy ("endless, liquid tapestry," "sudden, euphoric rush"). Some phrasing leans into abstraction ("tone of loosened grief") where concrete imagery would be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is competent but heavy on modifiers and standard metaphors ("viscous as mercury," "throbbed with the weight"). Phrases like "creating an aesthetic of integrated fragmentation" drift into expository telling rather than embodied description.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose contains striking imagery but is marred by "telling" artifacts (e.g., "Her motivation was to...") and occasionally clunky adjective pairings ("sturdy brittle"). These moments disrupt the narrative flow and distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally evocative but marred by awkward phrasing where prompt elements are inserted (e.g., "vigorous tender performance" missing punctuation). These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and feel artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("spiderweb of fissures"), but suffers from occasional clichés ("kaleidoscope of foreign imagery") and oxymoronic artifacts ("chaotically precise"). The density is high, but the reliance on expository telling to set the scene drags the momentum in the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose has momentum and density, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought imagery like "metaphysical tumblers" or "forest fire trapped inside a seed." The phrase "clandestinely luminous" is integrated into a mechanic but remains texturally awkward. Sentence rhythm is varied, but the reliance on adjective-noun pairings slows the pace during action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is propulsive and dense with imagery; "scream lines" and "cello bowing the air" are standout descriptors. The sentence "he was symphonically minded" reads as a slight scaffold/prompt-insert artifact, but the overall line-level craft is polished and rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by clunky, passive phrasing to accommodate prompt elements (e.g., "indicate the timeframe was tightening before the next phase of the planetary cycle initiated"). Noun strings like "polished basalt worry stone dent" also stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from density issues in the climax, leaning into purple phrasing ("symphony of attempts," "robe of crimson glory"). While functionally clear, the reliance on metaphorical labels for sound ("Exhale of Forgiven Regret") creates a filter that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose relies on abstractions ("impending reality," "biological grandeur," "organic truth") instead of concrete imagery. The verb "journalize" clashes with the naturalistic tone, reading as bureaucratic.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally serviceable but breaks immersion at the climax with jarring scientific jargon ("accelerates plant growth by stimulating cellular division"). This expository telling flattens the mystical tone of the peak beat and explains the magic rather than dramatizing its effect.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong sensory density ("saline gloom," "oxide") is marred by repetitive sentence structures ("She [verb]") and filter verbs ("she spotted," "she understood") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is mechanically competent but dense with modifier stacks ("resin-preserved sunlight," "prism-song bell ringer") and abstract phrasing. The reliance on label-speak ("synesthetically blessed") and forced prompt phrases ("oscillating repose") disrupts the line-level rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the acoustic descriptions are strong ("avalanchingly quiet"), the prose is weighed down by somatic clichés ("blood pound," "tears streamed") and adjective-heavy phrasing ("meticulous process," "organic pointers"). These artifacts dull the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is atmospheric but leans heavily on adjectival density and abstract "telling" ("atmosphere of lucid turbulence"). Several moments rely on exposition to convey internal states rather than dramatizing them through action. The rhythm is functional but slowed by the explanatory scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from a repetitive "adjective, adjective noun" artifact (e.g., "restless, jittery," "silent, majestic," "solid, cool," "chaotic, beautiful"). This pattern creates a rhythmic monotony and reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is descriptive but leans on purple phrasing ("surreal cathedral," "vacuum," "fractals") and abstract noun constructions. Several beats rely on telling ("method was specific and strange") where concrete action would have been more effective.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from several abstract constructions and clichés that dull impact ("curved like a question mark," "white noise of nothingness," "cold wind of cancellation"). The "taste of latent sacrifice" is an example of abstract synesthesia that explains the mood rather than evoking it through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with some strong phrasing ("coax resilience from rubble"). However, the text relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("terrifying silence," "ancient mechanics," "colossal engine"), which slows the momentum and feels decorative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rhythmic and functional but relies on several clichés in the opening ("echoing silence," "skeletal remains," "dust motes danced"). While the "sensory map" metaphors are inventive, the reliance on stock atmospheric phrases lowers the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally obscures clarity ("human erosion," "deceit of words," "silence like a heavy coat"). The reliance on abstract descriptors for emotional states ("luminescent ache") lessens the visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has density and momentum but relies on several clichés ("watched like cold, unblinking eyes," "sword of green fire") that diminish the literary quality. Additionally, the paragraph explaining "total internal reflection" reads as expository slowing rather than active description woven into the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative ("staining silks with the blood of beetles"). However, a few phrases land awkwardly or feel overwrought, such as "hush of valley-mist wonder" and "syncopated rhythm of triumph." These abstract descriptors slightly dilute the otherwise concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjectival density and abstraction ("metaphysical grease"); the "literal silver pin" moment reads as twee and overly convenient, breaking the immersion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose relies on several clichés ("copper and ozone," "abyssal void," "drowning woman") and abstract telling ("psychic resonance") that blunt impact. Adjective stacking occasionally clogs the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is readable but marred by stock phrases ("burning a hole in his coat pocket," "hidden in plain sight," "heart hammering," "shimmered only when he was not looking directly at it"). These clichés reduce the immediacy and texture of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is functional but marred by "telling" constructions ("He was a chronicler," "movements with a specific purpose") and adjective stacking ("overgrown sprawling mess"). The phrase "heuristically gentle" creates a significant register artifact that feels algorithmic or forced. "Chaotic tapestry" is a cliché that weakens the image. The rhythm is generally smooth, but the line-level craft lacks the precision required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, but the integration of mandatory phrases creates awkward syntax, specifically the tense clash in "worked within the specific timeframe while illusions fade to memory." Modifier density is occasionally high ("gentle meticulous," "delicate needle"), slowing the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is frequently overwritten and heavy on adverbs ("tucked poorly," "echoed softly," "capped... instantly") and clunky similes ("dragged like anchors," "wool blanket"). The density of modifiers slows the momentum of what should be a tense exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in lines like "low-tech dowser for a high-tech mystery." There is a slight reliance on adjective strings ("wild, primitive roots," "sudden, sharp spike"), but the rhythm generally propels the narrative forward effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from heavy adjective stacking ("heavy, beautiful melancholy," "deep, bruising blues") and a reliance on "telling" the significance of objects rather than showing their impact. The writing is grammatically polished but stylistically dense with interpretive filters that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    High density and evocative imagery anchor the atmosphere, but a few instances of scaffold phrasing ("painstakingly working by piecing") and a likely typo ("overgrave") mar the polish. The expository explanation of the somatic trait interrupts the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic ("muted vigor," "stagnant peace"). Some phrasing leans toward the abstract or slightly purple ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder"), which distances the reader from the raw physical immediacy of the sound. Otherwise, the line-level craft is strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is efficient and propulsive, though it occasionally leans on standard phrasing ("screaming void," "white-hot," "clenched his mechanical fists"). While structurally sound, the line-level craft lacks the unique rhythmic texture found in the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from mixed metaphors ("debris of panic to find the golden threads") and clichéd phrasing ("surgical care," "sounded like a gunshot"). High-concept descriptions often obscure immediate action, and the density of adjectives slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but heavily reliant on abstract telling ("sensation of mysterious familiarity," "paradoxical logic") and smooth clichés ("tasted like salt and iron," "dissipate like ink in water"). These filter the experience through generic labels rather than grounding it in specific, textured observation. The line-level writing prioritizes flow over high-density information or fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly atmospheric, with standout phrases like "high-frequency hum of salt growing over lost time." While the imagery is generally exceptional, minor stock similes ("blue as a bruise," "spikes... like teeth") slightly hold back an otherwise flawless technical execution.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is dense with abstract noun phrases ("infinitesimal fissures," "absolute stillness") and adjectival clutter ("fragile artifact," "malevolent probability"). The required phrase "terrestrially cosmic" creates a jarring semantic clash that disrupts the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is high-density and evocative, with strong imagery like "scratches on a developed negative." There are minor moments of adjectival stacking ("patiently nimble," "distinct and jarring") that could be pruned for sharper impact, but the rhythm generally supports the tension well.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory imagery is vivid and purposeful ("thick enough to stroke," "air screamed"), establishing a strong texture. However, the prose suffers from telling rather than showing in key emotional beats ("proving to herself," "motivation was...").

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is rhythmic and precise, with strong tactile imagery ("fibrous heart," "matte texture"). "Master calligraphy forger" is a slightly clunky noun stack, but the line-level execution effectively maintains the scene's hushed tension.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is functional and occasionally evocative ("spiraled interior smooth as old bone"), but often relies on adjective-heavy telling ("richly perceptive," "cold intensity"). The text contains several "purple" artifacts and abstract phrasings that obscure rather than reveal the action.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but static, often relying on adjective-heavy description ("delicate, haunting quality," "permanent, impossible swirl") that slows momentum. There is a tendency to "tell" emotional shifts and character traits ("Elara weaves truth carefully," "Her motivation was singular") rather than showing them through action, creating a detached, essayistic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from occasional density issues with adjective-adverb clusters like &quot;scintillatingly somber.&quot; The metaphor density is high (&quot;audible friction of the world turning&quot;), which works for the voice but slightly slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is functional and occasionally evocative, but it leans on heavy modifiers and clichés ("screaming with the fury," "sprouted like fungus"). The use of telling phrases like "Being sharply observant" disrupts the line-level immersion, and the summary of the letter reassembly flattens the textual density during the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought, slipping into "purple" description ("cathedral of gritty whimsy" is a direct, label-heavy insertion of the prompt). There is a reliance on state-of-being verbs and "began to" constructions that slow momentum, though the imagery of the "clockwork birds" and "static-laden voices" is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.6)
    While there is some beautiful imagery ("golden speck of sound"), the prose suffers from adjective stacking and telling. The phrase "an emotion that was positively wistful" is a jarring, label-heavy insertion that disrupts the climax with diagnostic telling. The writing often summarizes emotional states ("desperate motivation") instead of showing them through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from visible template cadence runs in key action paragraphs ("He removed... He placed... Elias opened... He felt..."), creating a monotonous rhythm during the climax. Several phrases feel awkwardly inserted to satisfy constraints ("fleshly ethereal," "logically emotional"), resulting in clunky, adjective-heavy constructions that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("coiled spring," "burning desire") and expository shortcuts ("motivation was complex"). While information density is adequate, the reliance on telling over showing in key character beats reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    While functional, the prose relies on several clichés ("clung to his suit like a second skin") and occasionally drifts into overwrought abstraction ("scream of the past echoing against the indifference of the present geometry"). These stylistic artifacts slightly dull the immediacy of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose has strong atmospheric density ("suspended energy"), but is marred by stock phrasing ("burning in his chest," "precision of a surgeon") and filter verbs. These artifacts reduce the line-level freshness despite the strong overall imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmic, successfully supporting the story's "holy mischief" tone. There is a slight tendency toward modifier density (e.g., "chaotic cathedral," "corrosive waves," "swaying sanctuary"), but the imagery is generally sharp and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Imagery like "profiles drifted like shipwrecks" is evocative and precise, and the description of the audio merge is mechanically clear. The score is held back only by the reliance on the "knuckles turned white" cliché in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from adverbial telling ("calmly intuitive") and well-worn phrases ("private eternity," "weighted breath"). While competent, the density of figurative language ("tectonic complaints") occasionally obscures the physical action and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is generally strong ("fractured hull," "fossilized bone"), but the prose suffers from some filter verbs ("perceiving," "realized") and minor repetitive echoes ("clinical... clinic," "solace... solace"). Adjective-noun stacking ("visceral terror," "hollow, resonant curiosity") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("passionate subtlety," "intersubjective understanding") that clash violently with the literary tone. Heavy use of abstract noun-phrasing ("creature of grief," "perspective she could not grasp") distances the reader from the immediate action. The rhythm is often static, relying on "telling" adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, though it suffers from occasional passive explanation ("The device was designed to") and weak transitions ("Instantly"). The imagery of the "sleeping vipers" and "heavy water" adds nice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally polished with some strong imagery ("dove gray map case"), but slips into abstraction and sentimentality. Phrases like "tangible ripple of earnest whimsy" are clunky, tell-don't-show descriptors that disrupt immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by adjective stacking ("pale grey light," "heavy, teardrop-shaped," "gentle, weathered innocence") and clunky modifier strings like "strangely sonically reflective." These artifacts reduce narrative momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong and rhythmic, but marred by a few mixed metaphors (the physics of the "retreating ocean" pull are murky) and clichés ("felt in the marrow"). These artifacts slightly dilute the otherwise high density of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lucid and rhythmic, with strong sensory anchoring. A few phrases lean toward the decorative ("whirred in a blur," "yearning for the sky"), but the line-level momentum and density sustain the story's high-pressure atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective-heavy abstraction ("pulsing stillness," "thick quietude") and "telling" metaphors ("hymning the mundane"). SVO sentence structures become repetitive in the middle section ("He turned," "He moved," "He sang," "He placed").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.1)
    Line-level craft is marred by the repetitive artifact of the phrase "quietly deliberate," which appears three times and disrupts the rhythm. Additionally, phrases like "ink and stardust" and "silence so profound it felt like a physical weight" lean on clichés that dilute the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative but occasionally dense with "noun-of-noun" abstractions ("fissure where his clinical diagnosis crumbled," "splint for the family's sanity") that distance the reader from the action. The insertion of prompt-specific phrases like "nostalgic innovation" disrupts the otherwise smooth register.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is competent but overwritten in places, with adjective-heavy phrasing ("jagged, frosted fragments," "rhythmic, humming process") slowing momentum. The phrase "atmosphere that felt like a zephyr bloom" is a mixed metaphor that disrupts the otherwise grounded tactile imagery of the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is technically competent but suffers from overwriting and high adjective density ("crystal daggers," "sticky quiet"). The reliance on abstract summaries of emotion ("perfect capsule of protected vulnerability") distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is weighed down by excessive adverbs and adjective-noun pairings ("lucidly watchful," "suffocating silence," "painfully awake"). These artifacts filter the experience and slow momentum, preventing the imagery from feeling sharp or immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from frequent clichés ("gathering hush," "cathedral of light") and distancing phrasing ("the unexpected happened"). Adjective-noun pairings are predictable, and the "whimsical tinkerer" label acts as a shortcut that reduces immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose has strong sensory density ("blind, soundless flare") and good rhythm. Some phrasing leans slightly into adjective stacking ("heavy, rectangular object") or purple abstractions ("skeletal geometry"), but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the imagery is vivid, the prose relies too heavily on adverbs and modifiers to do the work of description ("meticulously observing," "maddeningly delicate," "violently," "suddenly," "definitively"). Strengthening the verbs and reducing filter words ("He noted," "He knew") would sharpen the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive adjective-noun stacking ("ancient, greening alloy," "swirling, smoky regret," "small, porous chalk stones"), which creates a plodding rhythm. While evocative, the density of modification slows momentum and feels overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but marred by scientific or abstract phrasing ("cellulose lattice," "solid, manageable geometry") that breaks immersion. These "writerly" intrusions distance the reader from the visceral act of carving.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally evocative but suffers from occasional stock phrasing ("Regret flooded his chest," "force of a falling sky") and adjective density ("shimmered violently," "roiling expanse"). These moments of melodramatic shorthand slightly undercut the story's otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("hissing through the walls like a waking beast") and good rhythm. The technobabble solution ("kinetic energy from storm drainage... into pneumatic lines") borders on word salad but maintains enough narrative momentum to pass.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of adjective-noun pairings ("endless, mute passage," "thick, wet perfume," "specific, treasonous motivation") that creates a stilted, monochromatic rhythm. Phrases like "profound petrichor nostalgia" rely on abstract labels rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is hampered by repetitive crutch words (three uses of "specific" + noun) and abstract noun stacks ("geometry of a deception," "hindsight clarity"). These artifacts reduce information density and create a scaffolded feel.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("jagged, hollow tube"). The score is held back by the use of "Suddenly" to shortcut the climax and some slightly overwrought phrasing ("kernels of destiny") that borders on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from noticeable artifacting and overwriting, such as the redundant &quot;gleaming wetly&quot; and the clunky &quot;disproportionately loud.&quot; Word echoes (repetition of &quot;singular&quot; and &quot;lonesome splendor&quot;) and a reliance on adverbs (&quot;softly,&quot; &quot;vividly&quot;) detract from the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("wept mineral tears," "kaleidoscope of fossilized blues"), establishing a strong atmosphere. Momentum is generally good, though the ending relies on abstract summaries of emotion ("profound sorrow") rather than concrete sensory details of the character's reaction. A few filter verbs ("Valerius watched," "The prince felt") distance the reader slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from wordy, passive constructions ("began the delicate action to graft," "driven by a motivation to prove") that drag on momentum. Additionally, the register drifts inconsistently between mythic imagery ("ancient coin," "kingdom crumbled") and clinical/technical phrasing ("sonic signature," "organic chemistry," "synthetic adhesives").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is competent and maintains momentum, though it occasionally leans on stock imagery ("bruised purple," "cracking knuckle") that dampens freshness. The rhythm is solid, but the reliance on adjective-noun pairings slightly reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has a strong rhythm, but suffers from occasional overwriting and redundancy, such as "bioluminescent phosphorescence" (a tautological and scientifically clashing construct). Line-level momentum is generally good despite these slips.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density. However, the density of metaphor ("breathing rust," "loom of heavy ivy," "suspended amber") borders on overwriting in places. While beautiful, the constant poetic elevation risks drawing attention to the author's hand rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "tactile Braille of his regrets." However, the opening metaphor ("coastline was a mirror of his fractured soul") is a cliché tell, and some phrasing leans toward the melodramatic ("searing reverie," "garden of failures").

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but dense with adjectival stacking ("thick and soft," "pervasive," "velveteen") that slows momentum. While the imagery is lush, the reliance on "felt like" similes and explicit signal phrases ("signaled that it was") creates unnecessary scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is polished, the reliance on summary and telling ("The core concept... was deceptively simple") disrupts the scene's immediacy. Phrases like "shattered mirror," "starless void," and "trembling of his heart" lean toward cliché, reducing the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose contains evocative imagery ("teach dust to tell stories") but suffers from weak transitions ("Suddenly, the radio crackled") and a reliance on abstract phrasing ("narrative reclaiming its right"). The shift to conditional future tense at the climax interrupts the scene's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally polished, but marred by a few "telling" shortcuts like "looks exactly how grief feels," which bypasses descriptive opportunity. The insertion of the prompt phrase "somber marvel" as a noun phrase feels clumsy and forced. Some descriptions tilt toward the purple ("microscopic stars," "fortress of memory").

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.3)
    While descriptive, the prose suffers from stock metaphors ("metal mating with metal," "variable he could not calculate") and adjective-heavy phrasing ("hollowed, weeping shell") that drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is fluid but leans heavily on abstract, intellectualized phrasing ("physics of empathy," "internal monologues of apathy," "timeframe across unlearning hatred"). These "tell" constructions distance the reader from the sensory reality of the moment. The density of abstract nouns slows the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract sensory lists ("scent... reminiscent of... sudden grief"). Phrases like "vibrate in Elias's teeth" feel strained, though the line-level momentum remains functional.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong sensory details ("ozone and sour milk"), though some phrasing leans toward the overwrought. The dialogue mechanics are clean, but the explicit articulation of internal states ("driven by a desperate need") occasionally violates the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally evocative with high information density ("calcified knot of scent"). However, there are moments of narrative over-explanation, particularly where the narrator explicitly labels the fisherman's comment as "inadvertently profound" instead of letting the reader infer it.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The opening sentence contains a redundancy loop ("pressure... pressed"). Phrasing is occasionally abstract or clunky ("incisively kind precision," "surreal tableau"), telling the reader how to feel rather than showing the image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally evocative ("chalk dust... like dry snow"), but suffers from occasional awkward phrasing like "balancedly daring" (a forced insertion) and "concept of a timeframe was irrelevant" (telling/scaffold). "Friction-less" should be unhyphenated.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentence structure suffers from monotony, with frequent "He [verb]" openers. The prose relies on stock phrasing and clichés ("blanket of gray," "grace of a ghost," "silent scream") and tells rather than shows via adjective-heavy descriptions ("methodically hopeful").

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lush and evocative ("emerald-tinted," "weeping limestone"), supporting the atmosphere well. A brief lapse into expository telling during the explanation of the "seasonal thaw" slightly drags the momentum, but the closure imagery is precise.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten with adjectival clusters ("wet, malicious promise," "cold electric thrill," "neatly inventive grace"). Some imagery leans on clichés ("pricked at his skin"), though the description of the machinery and light is vivid and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("gaped with a rot"), but the specific prompt phrase "lingering luminance" is repeated three times in a relatively short space, creating a noticeable lexical loop. The "unbosom" usage, while prompt-mandated, feels slightly stiff in context.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.0)
    A clear tense error ("interprets" in a past-tense narrative) disrupts the reading flow early on. Repetitive word choice ("bruised plums" and "bruised streaks" in close proximity) and some "tell-heavy" phrasing ("It seemed too small a device") detract from the otherwise polished imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("flayed," "calcified ridges"), with strong sensory details like the "vibration felt in the teeth." Minor scaffolding ("The action was sudden and violent") slightly blunts the immediacy of the climax, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally competent with some strong imagery, but suffers from abstract telling ("logic... pierced his defenses") and a reliance on clunky metaphorical summaries ("train of history," "gangrene") that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Imagery is often strong, but the prose suffers from occasional redundancy and overwriting (e.g., "physically wrest," "physically fusing," "stoically sensitive soul"). These modifiers clutter the otherwise precise action of the repair scene.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is functional but relies on standard genre phrasing (&quot;physical weight,&quot; &quot;sputtered into nothingness,&quot; &quot;cold logic of survival&quot;). Adjective stacking (&quot;incessant, vibrating mechanical heartbeat&quot;) and slightly mixed metaphors (&quot;dappled resolve hardening&quot;) reduce line-level impact and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong verbs drive the action, but syntax occasionally stumbles, particularly the misuse of a colon to separate a subject from its verb ("His motivation: to fold... was"). Additionally, the climax relies on a flat "tell" ("The blood acted as a binding agent") rather than showing the alchemical reaction dynamically.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is high-density and evocative, with standout lines like "carved out of the negative space" and "mathematical waste product." The flow is only hindered slightly by the mechanics of integrating the prompt's specific adjectives, which occasionally feel less organic than the surrounding text.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("fingers danced," "bones of history," "threading needles") and purple phrasing ("bruising purple," "vibrate with latent energy"). Several sentences act as scaffolding rather than advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose has moments of high density ("gardener of bloodlines"), but suffers from register slips ("auditory phenomenon") and over-explanation of metaphors. Emotional beats are often summarized ("lacking the hysteria... possessing the density") rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by specific diction errors and strained metaphors. "Cost distinct lives" is a confusing usage (likely meant "many" or "specific"), and "furrowed hush" is a mixed metaphor that distracts. These slip-ups disrupt the otherwise smooth rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story suffers from noticeable grammatical friction caused by forcing prompt phrases ("when expectations collapse") into a past-tense narrative without adjusting verbs, creating a jarring tense clash. Additionally, subject-verb agreement slips ("backlash of regrets snap") and adverb clusters ("perfectly merrily melancholic") detract from the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong verb choices ("ignited," "shuddered") and evocative imagery that maintains momentum. The integration of the required phrase "delicately robust" is slightly expository ("The object was delicately robust..."), but the surrounding context justifies the definition. Line-level clarity is high, with no distracting artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    Imagery is often striking, but the prose suffers from adjective stacking and filtering ("distinct and undeniable," "profound and terrifying"). Some phrasing is wordy ("sensory hook, cast into the sky"), slowing the momentum during the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is overwrought, relying on stacked modifiers ("cold, crystalline," "simple, devastating," "breathtaking and suffocating") that stall momentum. Stock phrases like "viscous fluid" and "shimmered with forgotten whispers" detract from the otherwise strong imagery. The density of adjectives creates a "purple" texture that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by occasional clichés ("solidified moonlight," "cobbled together") and vague descriptors ("impossible colors") that undercut the imagery. The climax relies heavily on abstract nouns ("ecstatic, blinding happiness") rather than sensory specifics, violating the show-don't-tell principle at the most critical moment. Rhythm is generally controlled but lacks propulsion during the "agonizing" integration.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally competent with some evocative imagery, but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("vibrant hush" appears twice). There is a tendency to over-explain significance ("saturation of holding") rather than letting the action speak.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and readable but relies on several clichés ("liquid grace of a dancer," "crushed spirits," "uninitiated"). The mechanical descriptions are sharp, but the emotional texture feels standardized.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and dense, though occasionally reliant on repetitive sentence structures ("He closed...", "He reached...", "He arranged...") that slightly drag the momentum. Some phrasing leans toward the adjectival ("glistening, terrifying slide," "heavy familiarity"), but the clarity and imagery generally hold strong.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from adverbial clutter and "telling" constructions ("violently bruised," "dangerously resonance," "furiously tranquil"). While the imagery is often striking, the reliance on adjective-noun stacking and abstract modifiers reduces line-level immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from overwriting in peak beats, specifically the "scent of ozone and epiphany," which is a figurative muddle. Phrases like "style that could only be described as" add unnecessary filtering that slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on pleonasms ("trembling vibrato"), mixed metaphors ("skin of despair was flaking"), and purple descriptors ("violet bruise"). The density of adjectives and abstract nouns ("invincible certainty," "luminous fracture") obstructs the clarity of the action and creates an artificial distance. The writing strives for a "literary" aesthetic but lands on flowery excess.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flow is frequently interrupted by scaffold sentences used to bridge prompt elements ("His motivation was singular...", "To achieve this, he had to be..."). Additionally, reliance on adjective-noun clichés ("steely longing," "precise, trembling fingers") dilutes the impact of the stronger imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is vivid ("dark as dried blood," "shimmered with the text"), but the prose occasionally leans into adjectival stacking ("violent, fragrant riot"). The pacing is good, though the "mathematical equations of light" description feels slightly abstract for a sensory moment. The writing is dense and propulsive, though a few clichéd phrases (ice water, blank slate) mar the otherwise distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "adjective-heavy" description and synesthetic abstractions that border on purple (e.g., "saturated with a tone of cerulean regret," "heavy blueness that seemed to weep"). While technically functional, the density of modifiers slows momentum without always adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty (description + metaphysics) with near-zero scaffold; variety in length supports breathing. Metaphors stay consistent (cosmic ↔ wing) and physically coherent. Only micro-loop: “dust…dust…dust” recurrence in final third borders on insistence but serves emphasis, not padding. No artifact touches the closure beat; clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but breathable; figurative layering (“white lace,” “bruised plums”) is selective and purposeful. One scaffold pair (“she waited… she had to wait”) is minor; no loops or register drift in peak beats, keeping closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like a conductor’s baton; sentence openings vary from participial to noun-clause without drift. Information density high—single sentences do triple duty (e.g., “He waved the rod like a baton, guiding the heat…”). One scaffold spotted: “the capsize had taught him…” repeats the lesson twice; minor, but keeps it under 9. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—description folded into motive, e.g., “rotting shelves” triangulates setting, decay, and Silas’s vocation. Only one paraphrase loop (“heavy…weight pressing”) and one mixed metaphor (“storm within…geometry”) slightly dull the edge. No filler verbs; nouns stay concrete. Closure sentence (“stole a moment of the peace he had manufactured”) lands clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and tied to stakes—wind “howled… like a song” closes the arc without purple drift.

One paraphrase loop (“silent silhouettes… practiced stealth”) is minor enough to keep the 9-band in reach.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or causality; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught (inversion, light) and pays off; only micro-drift is “spiritual clarity” cliché, but it is instantly grounded by the physical drop/void contrast. Closure line is crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is organic; no template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative density peaks at the curl of photographs—“edges curling as if subjected to intense heat”—yet the vehicle stays visually coherent. Information is multiplex: “bleach-spotted memory” compresses chemistry, emotion, and visual in three words. One near-loop (“the bridge…a trembling…more like the shivering”) is minor and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the beat shifts. Figurative language is selective: “petrified candy,” “lacquer-peeled upright,” never stacked.

    Prose high-density: “texture-rich presence” collapses abstraction into tactile. No loops; “ticket” repetitions are purposeful reprises. Metaphor chain (rain-mirror, singing pillars, scratched ghosts) stays coherent under lens optic. Minor elevated diction “ambiguously clear” is earned concept-phrase, not register drift. Final line cadence resolves with tonic hush.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the atmosphere…blooming withering” fuses scent and paradox in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each pebble placement advances tension. Metaphors (“desperate hand,” “hungry light”) stay coherent to botanic and glass logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges the cracked-marble motif. Micro-hedge: “blooming withering” reused verbatim; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—longer clauses in stillness, staccato bursts at lever clank. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. One mixed metaphor bruise → indigo → violet is allowed under accumulative texture rule. Information density high; no scaffold sentences. Final line re-uses “warmth” and “cold” with recharged meaning, satisfying the read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, mimicking orchestral crescendo/decrescendo; no template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the weight of a swallowed truth… sat like lead in his gut” marries physical sensation to information payload. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—aurora as mourning curtain, models as arrogant—paid off at closure. No scaffold loops; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates through smudge beat then exhales into final lament. Minor elevated register (“conceptual cues,” “jagged algorithm”) is character-true and does not obscure causality; artifacts do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences multi-task: “condensation… caught the beam… like glistening jewels” shows surface beauty while foreshadowing moral mirage. Varied cadence prevents drumbeat; short clause clusters mimic exhausted alertness. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—each static crack, gravel crunch, and droplet advances guilt map. Closure image untouched by overwriting; final line breathes with release.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty: “The vines had long ago decided that the books were merely trelliswork” plants decay and agency in one stroke. No synonym loops, no mixed metaphors; “white inverted into total darkness” is clean polarity flip. Figurative language is spare, each image exact: paper edges “softened to the texture of fabric.” One hairline scaffold—“the noise of history ceased”—is a touch abstract, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is clean: no mixed metaphors, loops, or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; verbs are strong (“tuning,” “locked,” “slide”). Density flags only in two adjacent near-repeats about “softness” and “weight.” The final chord ringing “until it was swallowed by the wind” is an earned, read-aloud cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: “spiraling gantries of rust and preserved knowledge” varies cadence without purple overload. Metaphors stay physically coherent—iron lung, struck bell—anchored in setting. One scaffold loop: “bronze quiet” appears twice within 30 words; forgivable because it functions as motif-refrain. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks; closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences braid information with image: “velvet-lined case” + “marvel of optical engineering” = character, world, tool in one breath. Rhythm accelerates into the physical sabotage, then lengthens for the cosmic final image, mirroring emotional lift. Zero scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. A lone template cadence (“He…, then he…”) is forgiven under duress of manual labor.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally—long ozone-laden opener vs. clipped pedal commands. Metaphors stay physically coherent (silence as “structural beam”). Only micro-loop: “silence the silence” is intentional motif, not artifact. Information density high; no synonym churn or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and artifact-free: no loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors are single-strand and physically coherent (“lake stretched out like a paused breath”). Information density is high—each sentence layers temperature, sound, memory, and emotional valence. Final clause (“the fortune he had written for himself had come true”) delivers closure echo without expositional puff. Only hairline slip: two successive em-dashed descriptors in paragraph three; not repeated elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—advance motion, deepen world rule, anchor body. No filler, no scaffold loops; mixed-metaphor vigilance passed (stone flower bloom is single, coherent). Filter verbs minimal and voice-driven. Opening line anchors voice + stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges droplet motif. One hairline slip: “darkening brightness” is repeated descriptor rather than evolved, but it fuses conceptually at landing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: one sentence often layers geology, emotion, and tool function. No scaffold loops; metaphors (silver filament) remain consistent with physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; high information density—one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and symbolic freight: “glass dome…fragile lung preserving last breath.” Varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat; participles only when actions truly overlap (“feeling the vibrations…she raised”). Figurative language sparse, precise: metaphor of dome-cello is extended, not piled. Final line’s metaphor of silence-as-canvas is fresh yet inevitable, recharges “chronic hush” without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “counterfeit emotion dealer” unpacks through action, not exposition. Metaphors are coherent—honeyed gloom, jagged reality—never piled.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is taut, high-density; most sentences do two jobs (e.g., “The ocean wind plucked at the pages… but Elias was focused…”). Metaphors are sparse, clean, and physical—no mixed vehicles. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Opening and closing lines anchor and release the emotional arc with image, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is taut, lyrical, and propulsive; each sentence adds sensory or causal value. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—light as violence, silence as epoch—so the risk pays off in closure image. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence detected; clause variety mirrors thermal updrafts of tension. Only micro-slip: “razor-dust” is physically contradictory (dust can’t cut), but the image is brief and doesn’t dull the final gleam.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs— world, body, stake. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: “city’s blood,” “giant’s nap,” “diamonds” of frozen water.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors tide: long accumulative clauses that crash into fragment shards. No loops; “rain trails” returns only when image reweights. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“metal teeth of the ruins” bites coral without contradiction. Final line cadence—“slow, magnificent end of things”—earns its abstraction through prior concrete losses.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “bioluminescent pulse,” “geological memory,” and “shadow bridge” each carry causal load. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (“swirling vortex of impossible depth” matches pearl imagery).

Final line lands on monosyllabic certainty—“She had finally arrived”—after polysyllabic swirl, sharpening closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long, tidal sentences and fracture-fragments that mirror the dimensional splintering. Figurative language is dense yet coherent: “layers of wet silk” sustains the textile motif without mixed-metaphor spill. No synonym churn or template cadence; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor scaffolding: “the suppression of sound grew heavier” repeats the hushed-thunder idea twice in three sentences—−0.2, not fatal to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Density is high—each line advances stake or tone. Figurative language is spare, ozone/liquify metaphor kept coherent. One mixed metaphor “breach of social protocol” is minor. No scaffold or synonym loops; pronoun reference clean. Final line “truth…most potent magic” borders on maxim, but cadence earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; imagery is dense yet targeted. A single mixed metaphor (“bleeding sky” beside “gold leaf shimmered, absorbing…sonic vibration”) momentarily fuses visual and acoustic but remains legible. No paraphrase loops, scaffolding, or algorithmic repetition; prop tracking (notepad, prism, lamp) is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; every sentence layers new sensory job: “faded to a gentle gray” carries both visual and moral diminishment.

Final image is crystalline: “the hum of the cello merged with the silence of the void”—no padding, no filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm flexes with task tempo—staccato spray-can clauses under midnight calliope blare—then widens for the final constellation image. No synonym loops or scaffold; only minor simultaneity slips (“She shook the can… began to spray…”) which barely dent clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; information density is high—each clause adds sensory or conceptual layer (“wire frames biting… familiarity that bordered on contempt”). Metaphors are coherent: predator silence, geometry as etiquette. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed vehicles. Minor register peek—“metaphysical source of flow” is abstract for this voice but brief; no clarity damage at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or beat. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (“the masonry was failing… because the town had lost its shared balance”) is abstract but earned by prior sensory setup. Clause variety and paragraph breath control support accumulative crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “black ocean pressed… quartz dome… coral polyps and fibrous kelp” layers world, stakes, and obstacle in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (ocean as tomb, beam as resurrection). Rhythm accelerates across paragraph breaks to match O2 curve. One near-muddle: “velvet curtain” hush risks soft cliché but is saved by immediate sensory pivot to intake chamber. Closure beat remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm modulates: opening sentences lengthen to mimic heavy stillness, then compress into participle shards (“Hovering inches…”).

Final image is clean, uncluttered, ozone-tanged.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often sets, senses, and advances (“He navigated the narrow paths careful of strange flora…”). Figurative layer is restrained; only two metaphors across 770 words, both organic (“smoke” for veil, “universe” for gaze). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Final line cadence—“buttoned his coat, and prepared to face the cold world”—gives a quiet, exhale-close.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies from tidal cadences to hammered imperatives; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—“bruising shadows,” “tapestry of silver and stone”—each image advances setting or stakes.

Minor elevated diction (“somnambulant”) fits trance register and does not obscure causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Syntactic variety supports momentum—participial openers kept to 2 per paragraph, no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and non-contradictory (“botanical embrace” is physically accurate). One buried lead: “travel sack petrified in mud” could open its paragraph for punch. Otherwise every sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Copy-clean except one missing comma after “fig root.”

    Prose is dense yet limpid: “the granite knitting itself back into a whole, unbroken mouth” compresses transformation + metaphor in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; sentences propel. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) stays within Julian’s literate guilt-register. Filter verbs minimal; sensory anchors strong. Final line cadence slows to match exit into night, earning its breath.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose breathes with scene needs: long aqueous clauses mirror mist, then tighten to single-stroke verbs for the pen rewrite. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay tactile (cast = palimpsest, coral = seed). One paraphrase loop spotted (“the boy’s… the boy’s”) but not in closure third. Read-aloud rhythm natural; paragraph cuts purposeful. High density—every line advances image or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: each sentence advances image or stakes; no synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors remain physically coherent—welding torch, silver halides—until “electric energy,” a minor register drift. Opening and closing lines bookend with tactile stone and ghost smile, creating satisfying frame. One paraphrase risk—“beautiful futility” abstracts a beat already shown—keeps it beneath 9.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and musical: “biological chaotic noise” as sensor scrambler, “red searchlights sweep back and forth” beats like a metronome. One metaphor clutter—“warp the air itself, bending the light and twisting the gravity”—risks overstacking, but it crests with the closure beat and thus feels earned, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence openings rotate; paragraphs taper to mirror orchid flicker. Figurative density is high but taught early and justified by glass-garden cathedral aesthetics—no muddle in climax. One paraphrase loop: “fragile lattice... fragile miracle” conceptually rhymes without advancing pressure, −0.2. No scaffold, no synonym churn elsewhere. Information density strong; opening and final lines carry double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned—light as syntax, sound as resonance—so the density rule is waived. One mixed metaphor (“ribbons of light…tangled into a chaotic knot of dissonance and screeching feedback”) is forgiven because the spell’s physics is itself hybrid. Information density high; every sentence advances spell, relationship, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—exposition embedded in action, no paraphrase loops. Variation in length and cadence mirrors thermal inhale/exhale. Only minor hedge ("precise time of night described") could trim, yet it serves archival tone. Metaphors ("building breathes") remain coherent and physically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence can launch bird, reveal meteorite origin, and tilt trust. No loops; no synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent—dust = pollen, attic = nest, bird = stylus. Scaffolding excised; no filler gestures. Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence openings, paragraph breaths match emotional fall/rise. Proofing clean. Final line reprises opening scent, achieving circular cadence without redundancy. One hairline mixed metaphor—“jagged fragment…colder than room” is physically impossible yet poetically licensed; does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative language is disciplined—wood “map of time before it shattered” is the only extended metaphor, paid off by literal fissure. Information density is high: one sentence slips between atmospheric cracks, names father’s motive, and foreshadows closure. No filter-verb clusters; verbs are strong (“stripped,” “bled,” “wedged”). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety strong; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language peaks at “living galaxy” and “vertical abyss,” but density stays controlled—never more than one image per high-pressure sentence. Opening line anchors voice and cosmic/abyss tension in twelve words. Final clause “ashes of her past behind” risks minor cliché; trimmed 0.1. Otherwise, information-dense, propulsive, clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do double duty: “salt spray and hot circuitry” marries world and theme in five words. Varied rhythm accelerates during the cascade beat, then lands on spare final image. Metaphors are precise—“diamond cutter,” “rare flower”—never mixed; overwriting vigilance satisfied. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase detected; each clause advances cause, atmosphere, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty—world, body, metaphor—without clog. “Ink…began to fledge” is fresh yet clear; no mixed metaphor. Micro-loop check clean: no paraphrase pairs or template cadence runs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor density alert: three adjective clusters in one sentence mid-ritual, but they serve the feathering image and do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: long, wave-like sentences during ripple-reading; clipped fragments at sun-breach. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“crystallized cloud”), and paid off. Zero scaffold loops; no synonym churn. Information density is high—each sentence layers glass, tide, or light data without padding. Final line resolves by image, not exposition, meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences braid scar, terrain, cosmology. Figurative language is patterned (kiln/fire siblings) and paid off, avoiding purple clutter. One scaffold trace: “hard softness” repeated conceptually but accepted as thematic aperture. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; closure image remains luminous and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent tension—varied sentence openings, purposeful paragraph cuts. Figurative language is dense yet coherent; vehicles rarely clash. Minor scaffold: two “He...then he...” stems and a near-paraphrase about “pattern locked into universal lattice” could trim. Closure beat is crystal-clear with no mixed metaphors dulling the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, sensory data, and emotional charge (“The echo told him the passage was narrow but stable, though the return signal carried a heaviness that made his chest tighten”). Virtually zero scaffold—no “he thought to himself” padding, no synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught: the building’s “dark throat” reappears in the scream motif, paying off at closure. Rhythm modulates with scene tempo; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Opening and closing lines are crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, accelerating into the spell then fracturing at bell strike. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor (droplets as lenses, lullaby as code) serves dual purpose—image + mechanic. Zero loops, no scaffold; “rain,” “droplet,” “light” recur only when physical state changes. Final clause “possibilities had been shown, and the seed…planted” is concise closure image without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lines are dense yet breathable; metaphors (“dragging shadows like wounded beasts”) serve dual sensory + character work. Zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Final sentence delivers a conceptual re-pricing in eight rhythmic beats. Copy-clean.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule: “concrete dams had driven into total extinction three years ago.” Figurative language is controlled, no mixed metaphors. One scaffold: “manufactured drought was his masterpiece” slightly over-explains a fact already shown. Final line earns its resonance without cadence cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and staccato shocks (“The thread snapped…”). Information density high: each sentence advances setting, stakes, or sensory charge. One metaphor mix risk—“landscape of alarming serenity” (violence + serenity) but the oxymoron is thematic, not accidental. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; “sharp, unbreakable thing” is the only near-abstract phrase but it is immediately embodied in the spell-picking action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is high-density: “meteor hush” compresses cosmic and acoustic scales in two syllables. No synonym loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the ink/parchment palette. The single filter-verb cluster (“began to reverse”) is grammatically justified by the continuous aspect of undoing. Final paragraph slows with paragraph-length sentences that breathe toward stillness, earning the cadence shift. Only hairline slip: “painted eyes of the wooden actors” is minor reuse within one sentence, but it echoes the puppet trope acceptably.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences do double duty (“He gathered slender stalks… and wove them together” advances action, ritual, and metaphor). Figurative vehicles stay physically coherent—no mixed metaphors. Opening and final lines are image-anchored, not abstract. One clause of elevated register (“the specific and dwindling hour during the migration”) is brief and motivated by Elias’s precision mindset; it does not blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty: “The bronze rushed into every tiny perforation, solidifying the ephemeral notes into something that could survive the coming ice age” advances plot, theme, and stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is singular and exact—“violent transition of matter,” “womb for the metal.” Figurative language plateaus at climax without muddling causality. Final line is taut, percussive, echoing the bell tone.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft excels: every sentence does two jobs—image + pressure (“concrete ribs… vibrated with a low, magnetic hum”). No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent (earth’s pulse → chain vibration). Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat: three stacked modifiers on storm sky (“bruises of violent purple and heavy lead”) but the rhythm justifies the surge. Closure line—”She pulled the lever, finally merging with the storm”—is clean, propulsive, sonic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose carries dense information without scaffold: “extinguishing every second torch he passed to conserve the sacred oil” does setting, motive, and world-rule in one sweep. Rhythm modulates—compressed clauses during chalk-work, open cadences for cosmic aperture—never monotonous. Metaphors are spare and physical: “reality…peeled back like a layer of old parchment” fits the parchment-era frame. Zero loops, zero synonym churn, zero overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences multi-task. One template cadence run (“He... then he...”) in cylinder-return beats −0.3. No mixed metaphors; mercury-to-glass shift is coherent. Information density high until “cellular memory” label, which glints as scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density, few filter verbs; sentences perform double duty: “twilight frost turned moisture into jagged diamonds” advances both image and stake. Figurative language is patterned—glass, crystal, mirror—so density reads intentional. One mixed metaphor (“cold fire”) touches closure beat; −0.3 artifact. Elsewhere rhythm modulates with breath, no template cadence. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no loops.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and varied: concrete nouns (“creaking frame,” “jagged wound”), strong verbs (“hoisted,” “spat the needle back”), rhythmic paragraphing. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (orchard as spiritual limb) stay coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers resonant send-off. A single mixed metaphor (“breathing again” for magic) is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “luminous anxiety that made his teeth ache” does three jobs—sensorial, emotional, causal. Figurative control: radiation → orchard → library metaphor chain is coherent, paid off when trees “point” toward habitat. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or image. One near-miss: “simply complicated” is abstract; a concrete bodily paradox would have hit 9.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are dense yet lucid, often doing three jobs (image, world-rule, character filter) in one sweep: “paper-thin blossoms sprouting from the cracks in the history section.” No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Opening and closing lines are acoustically matched (“unheard symphony” ↔ “quiet, satisfied hum”), giving lyric closure. Only micro-slip: “resourceful as she conserved” is filler-ish; delete “as she conserved” and beat holds.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and action. One scaffold stem—“the ship… unable to sail yet refusing to sink”—is repeated with variation; tolerated under pattern-teach rule. No mixed metaphors; “velvet curtains in the portholes” is precise. Final-line cadence—“silent, permanent passenger”—lands cleanly, recharging earlier voyage imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only one adjacent paraphrase pair (“He did not force… he coaxed”) recycles micro-gesture, but it is purposeful, showing patience. Metaphors are consistent—rope as timeline, wax as template—and do not violate physical logic. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density is high (one line can stage, sense, and symbolize). The final line’s monosyllables give a clean auditory close. One tiny register lift—“conceptual repricing” territory—keeps it from perfect 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances sonic logic. Figurative language is spare and physical—“neon wire,” “iron blanket”—never mixed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Micro-flaw: “gently luminous” appears twice in close proximity; a variance would sharpen contrast before the white flare.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from lyric cadence to staccato crank-by-crank without algorithmic pattern. No paraphrase loops; each image advances pressure or atmosphere. Metaphors (“lance of pure, white brilliance”) are spare, never stacked. Final line “the coincidence was a lock, and she had found the key” lands clean, no overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors—and climactic beat stays uncluttered. Minor scaffold: “the smell of ozone and the specific angle of the light” could trim “specific,” but the redundancy doesn’t touch closure. Rhythm modulates from long atmospheric clauses to the stark final sentence, earning high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with spin-rate: long sentence for pendulum arc, fragment for mortar thud. Figurative density spikes only at bloom moment, pattern-taught by earlier “garden of living light.” Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances image or chemistry. Final line restores silence without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long accumulative sentences build pool imagery, then single-line permission releases. No synonym loops; “tide brings new things…” is first plain sentence after rich texture, making it land. One mixed metaphor—“fractured eye to reveal…constellations”—barely grazes closure. Information density high: one sentence often does description, metaphor, and interior shift.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; clauses carry triple duty (image, motion, emotion). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“ghost physically holding her hand”—is forgiven by its paradoxical intent. Peak beat clarity is high: the visual whip-crack of tendrils retracting is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentences multitask: “the silence here was wild and feral” fuses metaphor and stakes in five words. Rhythm breathes with altitude—paragraphs swell and contract like lungs adjusting to thin air. No figurative muddle; every image pays rent to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “kaleidoscopic waterfall of recycled hydro-coolant” packs world, tech, mood into seven words. Sentence length varies strategically; long sensory lines settle, then clipped fragments during quake/klaxon. Metaphors sustained—wall skin, waterfall curtain—without mixed vehicle clash. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Opening line anchors voice/stakes; final line crystallizes new command, recharging throne motif.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“burnt cathedral,” “tender shadow keeper”—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one line can anchor setting, reveal psyche, foreshadow cost. Final thud is monosyllabic, sonic closure that mirrors thematic silence—rhythm serves beat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure: longer sentences in calm fungal rows, staccato bursts during compression. High information density—each sentence advances setting, character, or physics rule. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge the indigo heartbeat motif.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate between prepositional, participial, and direct clauses. Metaphors (“ancient bones grinding inside a metal ribcage”) are specific, non-contradictory, and brief—no purple accretion. Information density high: one sentence often conveys gear sound, bodily cost, and emotional import. One scaffold trace: “He did not immediately turn it, however” could lose “however” without tremor, but the loop is isolated and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density; each sentence layers task, metaphor, and physics (“latent regret in the soil”). One template cadence run—three sentences in a row open “He …” in the unstrap beat—dulls flow slightly but does not obscure causality or closure. Metaphors stay internally consistent (glass to dust to light). Proofing clean; no loops in final third. Publish-ready with microscopic polish.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Information-dense lines perform triple duty: “grey sediment settled in precise layers” simultaneously sets atmosphere, pronounces theme, and seeds the causal clue. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Metaphors are internally coherent—dust as archeology, button as promissory token—never competing vehicles. Rhythm modulates from cataloguing drone to hush of revelation without syntactic drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is loop-free, scaffold-free, high-density: “the thick liquid swirling around her ankles and staining her coat” does triple duty—sensation, consequence, foreshadowing. Metaphors are sparse yet exact: “suffocating blanket” of apathy, “gilded shroud” of lagoon—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates across the submerged causeway, then slows for the key-turn beat, aligning breath to stakes. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends: “pulsed with the latest iteration of the past” vs. “weapon against oblivion.”

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: information dual-loads—light pulses → data streams; silence → cage. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates from long fugue sentences to the staccato of dying clicks. A single over-ripe phrase—“cathedral of fractured glass”—is the only ornamental drag, not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: single sentences deliver tactile fact, world rule, and emotional tilt (“ash continued to fall, but… looked less like destruction”). No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Figurative vehicles stay consistent—ash = snow, seed = crown, moonstone = glint of history—without mixed-metaphor clutter. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates across the final beat (icicle crack → spiral upward) then exhales into closing snow image, matching sapling pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates from meditative cataloguing to staccato leap—“ran… launched… screamed silently”—without template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence can anchor time, stake, and sensory cue. Copy clean; only minor scaffold—“the object he sought”—does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “relentless rain…sheets of slate gray” packs two sensory cues in five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay internally coherent—gold as lightning, regret as captured sun—without mixed vehicles. A single register drift (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by Elara’s scholarly interiority and occurs outside the closure beat, so the 9+ gate is not breached.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the read-aloud rhythm. Metaphors stay acoustically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Only minor scaffold: “the heavy chains…shattered” leans cliché, but it occupies a single line and doesn’t touch the closure image. High density—each sentence layers atmosphere, tool action, or emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information-dense yet musical: “the flora did not photosynthesize sunlight but absorbed the silent, screaming radiation” packs world-rule + horror in one stroke. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances map, body, or concept. Metaphors stay physically coherent within UV logic. Final paragraph modulates cadence—single long sentence of symmetrical pain distribution, then clipped stillness. Minor over-crank in opening (“jagged clarity that came only after…” is the only near-cliché).

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image, stakes, or body. Sentence rhythm modulates from long inhalation of description to clipped surgical beats (“With a sharp inhalation, he pulled…”). Metaphors stay physically coherent: lens-beam as scalpel, pigment as knot. No scaffolding, no mixed metaphors, no register drift; the elevated diction is earned by the metaphysical task. Closure sentence—“Elian closed the book, satisfied that one more ghost had been given a home”—lands with echoing cadence that recharges “home” as archive.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary rhythm; high-information lines (“He noticed that the grey powder was distributed evenly…”) compress diagnosis without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop (“groaned…groaned” in successive sentences) but it mirrors mechanical echo, tolerable. Figurative control: “weightless burden” is clean, single vehicle; others are sparse, avoiding purple. Final image (“descending truth”) is earned, not tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths swell and contract with press strokes. Metaphors are clean (frost as fingerprints) and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop—“the rustling awakenings grew into a roar”—is purposeful escalation, not artifact. Information density is high; every clause advances image or causality. Minor filter-verb cluster mid-fall keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering serves the lyric mode without clogging causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; each sentence advances image or stakes. One near-purple phrase—“terrible, heavy beauty”—is earned by prior sorrow-polishing and does not dull the final refraction image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “rasp of rust,” “kaleidoscope of ruby shadows,” each sentence layers sense and stakes. Rhythm accelerates with the spinning gear, breathes during polishing beats. One mixed metaphor (“city’s last lung” alongside “music box”) is earned by world logic. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no scaffold. Closure line is clean, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and tied to olfaction, avoiding mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“black and still as a mirror made of obsidian”—could compress, but it does not stall momentum. High information density: each sentence advances setting, motive, or causality. No scaffold, loops, or register drift in peak beat (drop → hinge).

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentence (“She wedged…airfield”) embeds four tool-actions. No scaffold; each paragraph advances situation or emotional charge. Metaphors are coherent—generator as heart, sculpture as leviathan—never mixed. One near-loop (“the alliance across time had held”) is purposeful echo, not churn. Read-aloud rhythm mimics turbine cadence, slowing into closing hum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops; metaphor chain (sunlight/void/lighthouse) is coherent and purposeful. One mixed vehicle—“spectral autumn light” beside “UV veins”—skims the edge of incoherence but is saved by the sci-flower premise; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths breathe with the descent/extraction arc. Only one scaffold loop: “the lagoon boiled...liquid heat...searing reverie” compresses three heat metaphors in two sentences, but the triple stress feels purposeful rather than redundant. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Information density high—each sentence advances goal or atmosphere. Closure beat is clean, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density: one sentence often performs ambience, stakes, and bodily cost. Metaphors are clean—“mind…flayed”—and sustained without mixed vehicles. A few contiguous “she”-openings create minor cadence echo but pattern taught early and climaxes with purposeful repetition. Small paraphrase loop: “amber bottle…amber shifting” in adjacent clauses costs −0.2. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative density is high but purposeful: “velvet disquiet” returns as charged poise, not ornament. Information density strong—one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, sensory, metaphor). Minor loop: “wax shaving…wax threatened…wax slipped…” thrice in 60 words; the repetition is thematic but still audible. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure line remains lucid.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene—long clause for spiral, staccato for pea. No scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent (vacuum of organized space) and payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; high density—“bruising purple shadows,” “acoustic shockwave,” “crystalline shifting of ice” each do double duty for sense and stakes. Rhythm accelerates with pre-zero-hour countdown, then breathes into long sentences mirroring the vacuum. No mixed metaphors; the dying capacitor whine is the only simile needed. Line-level clarity sharpens the final silence instead of diluting it.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is high: information-dense sentences (“she considered herself a custodian of mysteries” does triple duty—job, identity, metaphysics). Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses build to the flare, then short sentences for disintegration. Only minor scaffold: “the light faded, leaving the darkness to rush back in” is a near-paraphrase of the prior sentence; one −0.2 loop does not touch closure. Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles); no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles stay physical (glass soldered from bullet lead, silence heavy as honey). No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One paraphrase loop—“fresh, recurring wonder” echoes earlier “fresh, recurring” but the repetition is thematic, not artifact. Closing line “kingdom of quiet” is earned cadence, not template.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences deliver capsule failure, metal morphology, and cognitive leap. No loops or synonym churn; metaphor tree-root / concrete is precise. Rhythm accelerates at breach, breathes at stillness. Minor overpacking in “illogical storms that defined the era…” but does not obscure causality or dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do double duty: “The water… had deepened to a rich, heavy cobalt… reflecting the bruised purple” marries color, weight, and sky in one sweep. Metaphors stay coherent—sky as raw scrubbed skin, horizon as frayed fabric—without mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops; each detail advances image or action. Minor density flourish in “metallic glow” but it pays off in the final mirror image, so artifact cap not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “He coiled the metal with mathematical precision” marries tactile action to cerebral method in one stroke. No scaffold loops, no synonym churn; each sentence advances either tool-handling or bodily decay. Figurative language is spare and accurate—“the architecture groaned with sentient weight” personifies without purple excess. The final line’s consonantal hush—“the long winter”—provides cadence closure that echoes the opening shrug, proving rhythmic control serves the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “grav-lifts” vs. “dusty footprints” compress social divide in seven words. No synonym loops; metaphors coherent (“bronze quiet” extends to copper air and stone sound). One filter-verb cluster (“she noticed… she realized…”) mid-climb mildly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality or touch closure beat; stays within 9+ tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence can deliver coat brushing rail, smell of old rain, and satchel weight. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“tapestry of living emerald” is anchored to actual kelp threads. Zero paraphrase loops; no filler filters. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (roots consuming battlefield). One near-purple phrase “narrow vastness” is earned by structural repetition and pays off in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence music is deliberate but never purple; metaphor is lean and grounded (“predator’s quiet breath” fits the bloodhound trope). No synonym loops or scaffold; each line advances either decryption or memory. The single risk—stacked adjectives in the opening wind description—stays within POV compass and pays off in atmosphere. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence lengths, no template cadence, final paragraph lands with three escalating clauses that snap into a quiet monosyllable: “years.”

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong information density: single sentences often layer sensory data, backstory cue, and emotional charge (“heavy naval jacket she wore, her fingers brushing…gilded compass rose applique stitched over the heart”). Metaphors are kept to one per beat; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Minor scaffold: “the chaotic swirls were not errors…they were a language” could compress, but clarity remains intact and closure image is unmarred.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is densely imagistic but disciplined: each metaphor serves stakes (“chessboard of monumental proportions” = frozen reality). No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“mechanism of the world’s stasis”) is earned by fairy-tale register. Opening and closing lines perform textbook bookends—wind howl to horizon erasure—while middle sentences advance without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (“architecture in a strange, violet dimness”) stay physically coherent. Sentence variety mirrors sonic buildup—long, echoing clauses broken by the single hammer-clack. Opening and final lines act as acoustic brackets: first the dome inhales, last the text exhales into light.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    High-density lines (“petrified folios that rose miles into thinning air”) carry world-building, stakes, and image in one stroke. No filler, loops, or synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally consistent (geologic/bookish) and don’t collide. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long anaphoric shelf descriptions vs staccato seed beat. Clean grammar, zero typos. Final line lands on concrete noun “boots,” giving stability lexical click.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors. High information density—each thread-pull simultaneously advances plot, sensory texture, and metaphor—while rhythm accelerates with the rippling shockwave. Clean mechanics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is exuberantly figurative yet information-dense: each metaphor (silence as “forged hush,” spire as “phantom finger”) advances concept or stakes. One mixed-metaphor risk—“symphony of nuanced echoes” beside “prism of his art”—barely slips through because the acoustic motif sustains both. No scaffold loops, no template cadence, opening and closing lines ear-tested. At climax, density peaks but never muddies causality.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose pulses with breathless rhythm; sentence variety avoids drumbeat. Figurative layer is dense but patterned (kintsugi, amber, gold) and never muddles causality. Information density high: one line can do setting, sensory sting, and ritual step (“Green vapor curled around her ankles, signaling the final, fatal breach…”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; acid and gold lexicon stays in POV reach.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary naturally; no template cadence. High density: “preternaturally still, a sharp contrast to the roaring ocean” packs external/internal tension in one line. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in 800 words—and each pays off (mirror fracture → life fracture; beam → spotlight of judgment; widening smile → release). No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image (“the image in his mind was finally whole”) that recharges the broken-mirror motif.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or causation. Metaphor density peaks only during scent-projection, justified by the beat’s surrealism. No mixed vehicles: scent = carrier wave is sustained. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: storm sentences crack with hard consonants, jasmine line flows on long vowels, mirroring swell/relief.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose breathes with scene needs: long consonantal clusters mimic rusted gears, then clipped fragments at circuit completion. Figurative control: “swollen eye” moon is singular, not stacked. No filter-verb clusters; “she felt” appears once, justified as bone resonance. Minor scaffold: “the silence… was heavier” could tighten to “silence pressed heavier,” but momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentence can layer storm, ozone, and empathic roar while advancing plot. Metaphors stay physical—empathy as lead shield, silence as truffle—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. One microscopic scaffold: “rough bark of a root system” could slim to “rough root bark,” but the surplus does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density poetry without clutter: “solidified iridescent light” does triple visual/tactile/acoustic duty. No loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned—light=memory, gear=time—so density is earned, not purple. Final paragraph’s cadence of prepositional fragments (“toward the arched entrance… near the main gear… below”) creates gear-tick closure without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence can deliver cold, bioluminescence, quartz seam. Rhythm alternates between breathy clauses (panic) and hammered monosyllables (“He pressed. It fit.”). No mixed metaphors or loops; only micro-redundancy: “freezing vice” + “cold water” adjacent could compress. Final line—“sealing the map of his grief forever”—lands with clean sonic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: “freezing limestone,” “jagged face,” “cavernous mouth of blue crystal” in three brisk lines. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances position or stakes. Figurative language consistent—celestial wounds, lace void—without mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“viscous,” “caustic”) justified by royal POV and scientific Valerius lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—measured opening, clipped fragments during reaction flare, then quiet cadence at close. No scaffold loops; information density high (“palette of resolve” distills world-rule in three words). One near-mixed metaphor “gravitational emotional weight” is forgiven because closure clarity is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density—every sentence advances stakes, texture, or image; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent; only minor overpacking (“velvet texture of the mind”) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “humid air clinging like a second, heavier coat” does three jobs (touch, mood, body). No scaffold loops; figurative language is sparse and patterned. One mixed metaphor (“ghost of itself”) is minor; does not touch closure. Sentence variety sustains read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but never purple: each metaphor (storm as bruise on god’s skin) advances atmosphere or stakes. Rhythm accelerates with crystal spread, then fractures into staccato flakes. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends—twilight hush vs. rain toast—recharging motif without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Varied sentence cadence; no template churn. High-density lines—“the cork popped with a pistol crack”—do double duty (sound + danger). One moment of mild scaffold: “He took his fee from the table, feeling the usual hollow ache…” could compress, but it is four words past tight and does not touch closure. Metaphors (“rusty needle,” “broken mirror”) are controlled, never stacked; no mixed-vehicle accidents. Punctuation and tense flawless. The final image—“leaving the music and the ghosts behind in the dust”—is lean, resonant, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: each sentence layers image, world-rule, and emotional pressure—“impossible geometry,” “universe’s hiccup,” “comfortable nothingness.” Figurative language is patterned early (geometry, flowers) and paid off, avoiding overgrowth. One scaffold spotted: “wanderingly exact” is reused identically; paraphrase-loop avoided but the phrase’s reprise feels self-echo rather than evolution. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—water/mercy, gears/teeth—and culminate in closure. Strong verbs (“thrust,” “clatter,” “sawing”) replace modifiers. Opening and final lines bracket the arc with sonic echo (“groaning” → “next incision”).

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops, zero filter-verb stacks; each sentence advances either spatial mapping or emotional heat. Metaphors are spare and controlled—“living pulse,” “velvet-heavy hours”—never crowd the technician’s lexicon. High information density: one sentence slips in the three-year graveyard orbit, the mesh defiance, and the whisper ceiling, all without stall. Final line lands with perfect cadence drop, matching the released breath of the facility, proving rhythm is purposeful, not algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high-pressure beats use enjambed clauses to mimic train screech. Information density strong: “stent now lived in the hollow of her chest” fuses organ, emotion, location in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise; mixed-metaphor risk avoided. Final line “gentle impossibility that she accepted without question” lands clean, no modifier bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density—most sentences carry tactile detail plus plot function. Occasional lyric pile-up (“vibrating with the distant rumble… and the closer, sharper resonance”) slightly dilutes the urgent beat; no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors, but one filter-verb cluster near the spike keeps it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet effortless: “the wooden planks…smelled of salt and heavy pollen” does world, body, and mood in one inhale. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence adds new chemical or emotional state. Metaphors obey physical logic—ink mirrors sky, petals act as reagent beds. Final line lands with crystalline snap, recharging “laughter” from noun to climate.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary length and pressure; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined, never crowding the climax—“the logic of the heart” lands clean without abstraction overload.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    High-density figurative lines (“dense, tactile novel of ancient vibrations”) yet each image advances setting or emotional score. No paraphrase loops; every bark-slap offers new language. Minor register drift: “cosmic clockwork” edges grandiloquent, but fits mythic timeframe. Closure line (“memory of the silence within her”) is clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but purposeful—each metaphor (DNA shelves, moth-wing bullet) serves causality. One mixed image—“dry nib scratching empty air like vellum”—barely clears logic. Information density strong; every line advances premise or image. No artifacts touch closure, sustaining high band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motion, or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“moonlight turning into a visual rhythm section” extends the music conceit without mixing vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence can locate us, show bodily reaction, and advance gesture-score. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph breaks mirror camera pans. Only minor tic: two adjacent “his fingers” opens could be trimmed, but the beat is not peak-pressure; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.3)
    Every sentence does at least two jobs: “The air in the substructure tasted of ancient paper and geo-thermal heat” anchors place, tone, and bodily sense in twelve words. No scaffold or synonym loops; “soot-stained,” “volcanic tenderness,” and “geological layers” return only to accrue new meaning. Rhythm modulates—long, furnace-breath sentences in the Rotunda, then the staccato drop of “She dropped the charcoal.” Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physics-loyal. Closure beat is unmarred by any artifact, meeting the 9+ zero-loop standard.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, metaphors selective (“corrugated steel canyons”). No loops or scaffold; information layered (“folded corner to the top” teaches pattern). Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual spontaneity”) slightly drifts from worker lexicon but serves ironic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is spare, patterned, payoff-earned: “teach darkness the value of stars” recurs only in the final paragraph where it crystallizes meaning. Syntax breathes with the shutter rhythm—long refracting clauses, then abrupt cuts. No mixed metaphor, no filter-verb fog; prop tracking (mirror, lantern, louvers) is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes: long clause sets atmosphere, then staccato “*Now.*” propels climax. Metaphors stay consistent (fog = bruise, static = surveillance) without crowding high-pressure beat. One paraphrase loop: “the mental clamor was different…tainted with the electric thrill…” could compress, but does not dull closure. Clean grammar; no filter-verb stacks; information density high.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong kinetic verbs (“wrestled,” “spiraling”) and sensory specificity; one mixed metaphor “roaring silence” is forgivable. Filter-verb clusters absent; no loops. Copy-clean except a single tense slip “had ended overnight” that could trim to “ended overnight” for immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; every sentence either advances carving, removes feeling, or textures the hush. Metaphors stay mechanically coherent—gladiatorial imagery maps to wood grain without stretch. High density: one sentence can embody sound, memory, and legal risk. “The remade hush settled over him” is a textbook closure clause—no scaffolding, pure payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: cadence swells then fractures to mirror quartz lock-in. Metaphors are internally coherent—sky as spilled ink, atrium as vessel—and never mixed. One minor scaffold: “she began to paraphrase / She took the overwhelming…” is a two-sentence paraphrase loop; −0.2. Otherwise density is high; every sentence layers sensation, stakes, or world rule. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are clean: “serrated knife” for sound is apt to both reed edge and emotional cut. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “imperfection.” No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs—“crunched,” “shattered,” “gasping”—propel without modifier clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. “Heavy oak doors groaned” gives sound-tactile hinge. Mixed metaphors absent. High density: one sentence jobs—light converts, lens focuses, ribs receive. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no purple patches.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with the rain—long damp sentences, then metallic clicks. No scaffold or synonym loops; “ink,” “tape,” “measure” recur with gained meaning each time. Metaphors stay physical (ink “blooms,” tape “snap,” skyline “distorting”) and never mix. Final line is a distilled warning that echoes the opening skylight without restatement. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “atoms of nostalgia” and “heartbeat of the dead” compress world-rule and stakes in four words. One paraphrase loop (“her mind was no longer erratic; it was cold, sharp, and resolved”) is forgiven because it marks the cadence shift that ends her dance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is loop-free, high-density: “darkened, turning into a dense, obsidian-like geode” packs color, material change, and metaphorical resonance in one clause. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in the climax—each paying off the fusion of shadow and stone. Register remains within Elian’s arcane yet geological lexicon; no mixed metaphors or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines (“Instead of a smoking crater…”) do triple duty: world-build, sensory charge, theme. No scaffold, no synonym loops; every sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (meteor hush, Genesis-level vitality) and align with POV’s scientific bent. Only two adjacent “he began” stems, not enough to dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is loop-free, high-density: one sentence often performs sensory, metaphorical, and causal work. No mixed metaphors; “amber nebula” extends the projector-light motif cleanly. Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentences for incubation, staccato for release. Minor scaffolding in the opening clause (“The vintage movie palace…”) is forgivable scene-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry dual duty (info + atmosphere). Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. One minor purple patch (“swirling canvas”) but does not obscure causality. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Final line has propulsive snap.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift. Figurative language is disciplined: one metaphor per beat, each paid off (“silica petals dimmed”). Sentence variety accelerates into dispersion, fragments into gasp, settles into heartbeat rhythm—ear-perfect. Information density extreme: “oxidized monolith that seemed to reject the shifting sands” fuses world-rule, tactile detail, and foreshadowing in one line. Closure line “so long as the clock never strikes one” is uncluttered resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, sound, or causality. Metaphors are mechanically coherent—“cello-like thrum” fits iron oaks, “copper taste” anchors metal-world. Rhythm accelerates with the turning blades, then decelerates to mirrored heartbeat. Information density high: one sentence slips gear, slot, and psychological resonance simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and propulsive; no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (cloud-cobblestones, severed root, oceanic embrace) stay physically coherent. Opening line anchors taste and altitude; final line resolves into silence, recharging lullaby. One paraphrase risk—“the freedom often does” restates hurt—but the beat is saved by the visceral salt/mist pairing, so only −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences propel: every clause advances either trunk weight, nerve fire, or stair geometry. No synonym loops or paraphrase stall; “cobalt” recurs with purpose, branding the fortress. Metaphors (noose, drinking warmth) stay coherent and brief, never overwriting the cold. Final line cadence—“cold, blue dark”—is earned, not tag-on; closure beat remains lucid.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Compression is ruthless: “dust-choked aisles” delivers three senses in two words. Rhythm modulates—caesuras mimic drifting constellations; a single spondee (“He did not budge”) nails the immovable object. Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence either advances collapse or anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with noun, prepositional phrase, verb to avoid drumbeat. Figurative language is spare, selective—“rogue wave” of realization—never cluttering the high-pressure beat. Zero scaffold/loop; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Information density high: “torn atlas page bisecting a coastline that no longer existed physically” performs exposition, stakes, and nostalgia in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence can set smell, stake, and place. Metaphors are spare—“jagged slice of horizon”—and don’t clutter the physics. Rhythm breathes: longer clause chains build vibration, then a four-word sentence—“The lull was over.”—delivers payoff. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks; “She adjusted the focus” is the only minor filter, justified by tool use.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; every sentence layers job—heat gnaws, moss screams, fabric teaches. Metaphors stay geothermal: steam=curling shackle, amber=milky gold, never mixed. High density with read-aloud rhythm that mirrors decoding tension.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies intelligently; storm sentences billow, splice sentences cut. No loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances weather, body, or tool-state. Metaphors stay physically coherent (glass lung, teeth-chattering frames). High info-density: “inhaling salt spray, defying gray desolation” layers threat, setting, theme in one breath. Clean copy, zero pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the ocean… stuttered, repeating the same white-capped wave” does triple sensory, temporal, and ontological work. No mixed metaphors; bruising-purple light → bones throb → beautiful ache is coherent sensory chain. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knot, box, or wall. Final line closes with imagist snap: “began to paint” lands without clarifying medium, trusting reader.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse but sharp—“star in the void,” “dying god”—never muddies causality. Information density high: one sentence can embed UV sensitivity, internal clock drag, and emotional state. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. “Tame bird” final reprise of drone is a crisp closure sting.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure—long sentences to compress cold weight, then a sharp paragraph cut at the switch. Only two mild loops: “silence…silence” is purposeful reprise; “pregnant with the noise” risks mixed metaphor but sells the concept. No filter-verb clusters. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke. Clean enough for 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “sand that once weighed down war vessels” compresses history, guilt, and chemistry into eight words. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphors are coherent—dome as “fragile membrane,” quiet as “engraved,” blaze as “tranquil”—and converge on the final re-pricing. Read-aloud rhythm breathes: long loam-scented clauses yield to staccato alarm, then settle into the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances world-rule, character tactic, or sensory stakes. Figurative layering is purposeful—black tulips, velvet teeth—paid off in the diamond prism image. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Minor elevation near ceiling: one “resinous heavy frequencies” could lose “heavy,” but artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence economy is excellent; almost every line both paints and advances. Only micro-loop: “the silence here was usually absolute, a sanctuary for thought, but today it had been shattered…” restates the same binary. Indigo-ink-as-sky reflection is fresh; no mixed metaphor. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold. Final line “sending the regret spinning away into the dark” is crisp, propulsive, earns its lyric leap.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops, near-perfect information density: every clause either advances image, stakes, or tech rule. Rhythm flexes with pressure—long breathless sentences during warp, then clipped cadence at chime. Figurative language disciplined; “digital scream” stays within POV lexicon. Only hairline slip: “heavy, breathless quality of a meteor hush” stacks adjectives, but the cadence supports the held-breath moment.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do double duty: “the chalk he usually favored was useless on the slick, weeping stone” simultaneously tags tool, obstacle, and stakes. No loops; metaphors stay coherent (mist as quilt, then as sugar). Information density high; no scaffold. Peak beat—“a path of negative space”—is clean, uncluttered. Minor filter verb in “He realized” but forgiven because next clause is an embodied mandala act.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do triple duty: “He shifted his bulk to block the biting wind, creating a pocket of stillness” moves body, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. No scaffold: each clause adds new sensor-data or cost. Rhythm flexes with pressure—long Latinate clauses for retrospection, staccato fragments when drones pass overhead. Only nit: “architecture of his soul” is the single reach toward abstraction; it survives because every other phrase is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences multi-task: “The echo bounced off the dense hedge walls, growing louder and more solid with each reverberation” advances plot, textures sound, and keeps spatial logic. Zero loops; no synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent: violet streaks = time-bleed, roasted-peanut scent = 1924 lobby, all sustained without mixed vehicle. Peak beat—“silent thunder of his success”—compresses oxymoron into velvet-spiced triumph without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; high density—“velvet darkness” anchors tone and place in three syllables. Metaphors stay physical: lattice, cathedral, glass—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Opening and closing lines bookend with light imagery, satisfying cadence. No scaffold sentences; muscovite, aperture, diaphragm used with technical accuracy.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence-level propulsion is high: “The cave was reacting to the proximity of the sleepers buried miles below, amplifying their collective dreams through the conductive rock” compresses world-rule, stakes, and image in one breath. No scaffold or synonym loops; each metaphor extends the synesthetic logic rather than decorating it. Final line “wind…like breath filling a lung” offers textural specificity that recharges earlier salt-iron taste.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Information density high: “discarded punctuation marks of the valley’s people” compresses history and metaphor. Metaphors stay physically coherent—echo as “tangled knot,” sand “swirling, chaotic patterns.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “unearthed silence.” No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; no template cadence runs. Figurative density is high at opening but taught early and paid off in erasure image. One paraphrase loop: “fixing what’s broken” twice in 50 words (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; “jagged wound in the sky” is singular and sustained. Closure image is crisp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers stakes, texture, or sensory cue without scaffolding. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—yarn needle as stylus of fate, gutters as metronome—no mixed metaphors. Only micro-loop: “heavy…heavy” in adjacent clauses when describing the trunk; a 0.1 ding. Final line white-void image is crisp, uncluttered, earns its transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, every sentence dual-tasking: “It was only after the final petal drops…” simultaneously clocks time and signals resignation. Metaphors are spare and coherent—oars, bloom, conduit—no mixed vehicles. No scaffold or synonym loops; paragraph cuts test clean. Rhythm breathes with the mechanical coaxing, accelerating into the sharp click, then settling into the “quivering hush” beat. Final line lands with resonant cadence that re-illuminates the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is scaffold-free, high-density: “silk sheets pooling” does setting + tactile grounding + emotional vulnerability in five words. Metaphors are coherent—clouds as ocean, silence as unread book. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“lapping,” “rattled”) propel. Final sentence cadence mirrors inhalation of new air, satisfying ear-test.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from long breathy accumulations to fragment bursts (“A single thrush landed”). No synonym loops; “prismatic quiet” recurs with accruing resonance, not repetition fatigue. Metaphors are kept within physical logic—mirrors tilt like a flower, not like a dream. Final line “temple floated serenely on the surface of the deep” supplies cadence closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the air smelled of stale coffee and ozone, a perfect distillation of ethereal grit” marries atmosphere to theme. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors under peak pressure. One minor paraphrase loop: “the signal was not just noise; it was the engine...” restates in consecutive lines, −0.2. Opening and closing images (red light → smoke in ducts) create tidy envelope without scaffolding. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes: long layered sentences for pastels, staccato for the lance. No synonym loops or template cadence; “charcoal,” “slate-grey,” “fixative” are precise, not purple. Information density high—“the tiny tear…mimicking the reflection of a soul realizing its end” does triple duty: image, metaphor, cost. Only micro-slip: “dampening sound until the world was reduced to a furrowed hush” leans toward poetic filler, but it is isolated and early, never touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm controlled: paragraph lengths breathe from dense expository blocks to clipped ritual beats. Metaphors are selective—“clouds like bruised swollen flesh”—and paid off when they bleed away. One mixed-metaphor risk: “spongey dread” is vivid but “absorbed the beam of her headlamp into its porous gloom” layers sponge + porosity + absorption; still, the image coheres under accumulative lens. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varied, sentences pull weight (every line adds image, sound, or causality). Minor metaphor density in opening paragraph but pattern taught early and paid off, waived from artifact cap. Only loop: “the plastic did not flap randomly; it pulsed…” followed by explanation of same pulse—counts as one paraphrase, −0.2. Closing image avoids scaffold clutter and lands clean. Tense, grammar, pronoun reference all solid.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose shows rhythmic control and high information density: “young coders drank cold brew where elephants once slept” does world, tone, and irony in one line. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Filter verbs used only when voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve through concrete image. Minor over-adjectival moment in “dusky harmony of rotting velvet and blue monitor light” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are controlled—star as lung, eclipse as absolution—without mixed vehicles. No loops or synonym churn; “variable stars” repeats only when rhythmically necessary. One minor scaffold: “rhythmic ticking of the sidereal clock” could trim “rhythmic,” but it occurs early and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or emotional charge. Figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (concentric circles = seed attack = druidic ethos). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. No mixed metaphors; “drowning giants” stays within established orchard logic. High information density without purple drift: “ozone, crushed fruit, and panic” layers three senses in five words.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long, bruised clauses to staccato gasps—“He gasped. He saw.”—mirroring the shift from descriptive awe to psychic sprint. Figurative layers are selective, never crowding a single sentence; mixed metaphors are avoided. One scaffold spotted: “the path is locked inside the dead wood / I cannot read it alone” could compress to one line, but it occurs pre-vision and does not touch closure. Opening and closing images (“bruised thumb” sky / “burned into his mind” path) frame the text with echoing texture, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances causality or sensory charge. Metaphors are coherent—marrow as currency, sap as fate—without mixed-vehicle collisions. Information density is high: “sigils of restoration and memory” compress ritual, motive, and metaphysics in four words. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong—“slumped,” “surged,” “rattled.” Closure beat is uncluttered, letting golden light carry the reweighting, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: single sentences fold metaphor and data—rot-wood “screamed” gives sound to silence while supplying materials science. No mixed metaphors; quarry = void metaphor sustained without contradiction. Variation in sentence length breathes with escalation. Micro-loop only once (“the wood screamed and splintered”) but reads purposeful, not algorithmic; no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines perform bookend acoustic imagery with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentence delivers silence, timeframe, spiritual tradition, and station altitude. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either orbit danger or grief texture. Metaphors stay internally coherent—magnetic grammar, verb agreement—never mixed. Final third is free of purple or scaffold. Minor −0.3: “weeping iron-willows” and “recycled atmosphere” lean ornamental; still, they support tone without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is dense yet limpid: “viscosity of the fluid fluctuates with moon phases” packs world-rule, sensory cue, and stake in one clause. No synonym churn or scaffold; metaphor vehicles (brine as identity medium, crucible as memory forge) stay internally consistent. Minor cadence echo (“the... the...”) in opening sentence does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are spare and coherent—light as water, silence as pressure—without mixed vehicles. Every line advances either setting, interiority, or stake; paragraph cut test passes. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge the motif of hush becoming choir.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “structural iron surrendered to the slow, crushing embrace of ivy” fuses decay with tactile violence. No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and patterned—only three metaphors, each reweighted at closure. Opening and final lines anchor voice and image cleanly. One hairline slip: “the silence that followed felt different” uses a filter verb, but it is immediately compensated by sensory specificity (“cold and purifying”), so artifact level stays below penalty threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    High-density lines carry triple duty—world, emotion, motion—without metaphor overload. A single paraphrase loop (“the silence is not empty / it is a vessel”) is purposeful echo, not scaffold. Rhythm accelerates into exit beat, no artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops, no scaffold. Sentence rhythm accelerates across the eruption beat: hissing / cracking / slush—propulsion mirrors melt. Metaphors are controlled (mulberry = color + taste + bruise) and don’t collide. High information density: one sentence can layer sensory cue, interior ache, and political stake. Final line lands on image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rhythm breathes with task: long sentences while sifting static, single-word command at crescendo. No scaffold, no loops, no mixed metaphor. Information density high: one sentence places the grotto, the corpse, the aurora, the obsidian table, the kit. Figurative language sparse and precise—“lattice of light spun in perfect suspension”—never overloads. Final line is taut: “She had cheated the void once again, using paint, patience, and stone.” Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent—velvet hush, unspun wool, scalloped rind—and vanish after job is done. High information density: “hands stained with sap of memories not her own” does world, job, and poetry in one blow. Final line arrests without flourish: “quiet continuity of her work” closes on monosyllabic calm.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; every sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “embers… surrendered,” “roof collapses and buries you,” avoiding purple density. Strong verbs—“purred,” “sneered,” “crumpled”—replace modifier stacks. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, no scaffolding. Micro-teleport of pouch is the only line-level blemish, too minor to dull the resonant final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but breathable; sentences vary in length and openers. Metaphors are coherent—stone/ripple logic never breaks physical law. No scaffold, loops, or synonym churn detected. One near-purple cluster (“silver fire,” “magnetic grotto”) but it lands in the trance beat where heightened diction is motivated, so penalty is minor. Closure image is crystalline: “presence it had created” ends on monosyllabic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet transparent: “calcified ribs,” “vicious hum,” “melancholy frequency” all do double duty—evoke body, motion, and tone in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either map-making or memory. Rhythm mirrors skipping stone: short percussive clauses for impacts, longer legato lines for echo-ride. No mixed metaphors; volcanic glass logic stays consistent from knap to shatter.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise—navigating by sound-skipped stones in a bone canyon to find one’s own decades-old scream—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky compression (entire life in 740 words) pays off because the closure image reprises every motif without strain. Specificity of “harmonic stone skimmer” as profession feels discovered, not invented for prompt. Tropes (lost old man, canyon as labyrinth) are re-forged through acoustic physics rather than metaphoric fiat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet athletic: “brilliant dimness” compresses paradox into two words; “lingering luminance” reappears only when it can reweight the ending. No scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances cold, cost, or concept. Metaphors (wind “bit,” stone “sighed”) are spare, mixed only once (“visual silence that screamed”) but justified by the folly’s rule-set. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during mist-walk transitions, then settles into the final white flare. Zero filter-verb stacks; no artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent; paragraph lengths visually echo surfacing. Figurative control is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters. One scaffold trace: “he told himself he was simply retrieving lost property” is paraphrased twice, but each recurrence gains ironic weight, so loop is purposeful. Density is high; single sentences fuse action, tool, and atmosphere—“He adjusted the brass weights on his belt and stepped off the edge, plunging into the cold embrace of the harbor.”

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between staccato action beats and flowing prophecy lines, creating natural breath. Figurative language is sparse and coherent: “money of ghosts” and “physics strangled itself” are brief, precise, paid off. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, pressure, or knowledge. Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes; final sentence lands with imagistic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences often twin job – “He focused on the leviathan… the manifestation of drowning” simultaneously specifies object and abstract. Metaphors are spare and physical: “the trench has teeth.” No scaffold loops; only one paraphrase pair (“no longer a scream… but a structure”). Rhythm breathes with scene, accelerating as sun dwindles. Minor over-adjectiving “glittering sculptures” is buffered by final stark “quiet dark.”</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusing grief-counseling reaper with astronomical fear-alchemy feels fresh; trope of “naming fears” is flipped into literal gem-cutting. Sacrifice echo as renewable energy source for magic is non-obvious and internally coherent. Specificity – brass gears, prism array, wax cylinders – prevents conceptual slide into allegory. Risky choice to end in ornament rather than action pays off: the sculptures’ mute sparkle is the earned novelty.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary cadence to match drip anticipation; figurative language is spare, purposeful, never muddled; only minor scaffold appears (“the weight of the missing ocean pressing against his temples”). Information density is high; read-aloud rhythm propels without loops; closure image remains crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with descent: long sentences climb the ridge, staccato clauses punch stakes into mud. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“stain on the community’s history like a fungus”—never crowding the tactile. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines act as hinged mirrors, the silent chime and the silent valley, giving the piece a cadence that feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless line economy: every sentence advances gear, body, or atmosphere. No loops, no filler filters, no mixed metaphors. “Silence so profound it felt heavy” risks cliché but is earned by subsequent physicalization. Only minor scaffold: “a flaw that would shear…” is slightly explanatory; keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful: “blade of pure silence” literalizes the weapon’s function. No scaffold; opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line cadence echoes first—granite silence vs. pulse—creating lyrical closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythmic control is high: sentence lengths vary from 4-word bursts at rupture to 28-word flow states, accelerating without drumbeat monotony. Figurative language is spare and precise—“phallic spike” is the only overt metaphor, justified by the corpse-flower botany and charged by context. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. One scaffold-like “he knew” clause is forgiven because it collapses into immediate action within the same line.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: “static purgatory where physics had bowed to the weight of memory” delivers world-rule and mood in one clause. Figurative layering is relentless but patterned (engines = choir, exhaust = fog, silence = calcified) and pays off when laughter cuts through. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds. Minor loop: two “trembling” instances; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence length contracts in predatory moments, expands in lyrical passages. Information density high: one line can world-build (“solidified silence that had drifted down from the canopy”) and advance plot (breach signaled). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Minor register elevation (“conceptual core of my exile”) is voice-motivated and patterned, not artifactual.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long cooling sentences early, staccato hammer beats mid, finally a single spiral sentence that shoots skyward—propulsion mirrors thermal curve. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical state or cost. Metaphors stay inside alchemical physics (lattice, crucible, solvent) – no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “the holy metal weep and buckle under the intense, unnatural heat” does world-rule, emotional guilt, and plot beat in one line. No scaffold, no over-modifier purple; clarity never wavers even at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative layer is restrained—only two metaphors in climax beat, both paid off. High information density: one line does locator, tool, and emotional filter. A few adjectives (“swollen,” “jagged”) trend generic; keeps it from 8.5. No loops, no scaffold, strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with escalation: long sentences drift in stasis, shorten into propulsive clauses at re-entry. Metaphors are spare but precise—“sand synthesized from the sheer force of her hopeful will”—no mixed vehicles. High density lines (“constellations reflected…matched the static hiss”) fuse image, tech, and theme without padding. Minor template cadence in triple participial openers mid-story (−0.2), but artifacts never obscure the final image; closure beat is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often anchors setting, stakes, and sensory data (“He threaded the sinew through the impossible loop…”). Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; paragraph breaks coincide with micro-caesuras of breath or heat. Figurative language is selective—metaphors of lung, bone, glue—each re-used only when it can mutate (“a lung filling with air” becomes the white erasure). Minor scaffold: two adjacent “the sinew… the sinew” repeats cost −0.2, keeping under 9.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “flickered with the rhythmic breathing of the benthic city” fuses personification and tech in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are consistent—ocean as folded plane, anchor as prayer—without mixed vehicles. Final paragraph breathes with paragraph-cut variation: single sentence sitting in dark clinches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines carry double duty: “mist-clad atrium at twilight” fuses setting and tone; “jagged rhythm radiated” compresses concept and sensation. Metaphors stay coherent (ozone, hummingbird flutter) and peak-beat clarity remains intact. Minor scaffold—three sentences open with “She…” in close succession—barely audible. Read-aloud cadence escalates then hushes to match reeling hush payoff; zero mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences dual-load atmosphere + motion. Mixed-metaphor risk (“crashing hush”) is brief and paid off by context. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary naturally. One paraphrase loop detected: “pressure differential popped in his ears” shortly after “pressure…vibrated his teeth”—minor redundancy, −0.2. Technical phrases (entropy spikes, photonic data) are accurate and motivated. Final line lands with image cadence; no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: long sentences during static wait, staccato count during final sever. Every image pulls double duty (ink = conduit + grief stain). Zero filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Opening and closing lines book-end with mirrored bodily anchor (throat hollow → inked fingers) that recharges motif.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences perform double duty—image + causality—without scaffold: “He vocalized the friction he saw in the glass.” Metaphors are consistent (sound = sandpaper = bone), never mixed. No loops, no filler; paragraph cuts are surgical. High information density yet mouth-friendly rhythm; final line lands with imagistic punch, no explanatory tag.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—"broken finger" antenna, "cloud of butterflies made of light and sound." High information density; every line advances stakes or image. Clean copy, zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines are dense but propulsive: “The vibration wasn’t attacking their auditory circuits; it was resonating with the sap trapped beneath the concrete” does double duty (exposition + image). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical or causal information. Mixed-metaphor vigilance: “atmosphere curdled into tarnished wonder” risks abstraction but is saved by immediate sensory follow-up. Final line lands clean, recharging “bleeding” with both violence and vitality.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and tied to POV—“thunderstorm in a bottle,” “needle made of nothingness”—no mixed-metaphor muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. High information density: one line often carries sensory, emotional, and tactical data. Copy-clean; no typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear is excellent: sentence length modulates from 4-beat declaratives to 14-word lyrical coils without algorithmic pattern. Information density high; every sentence carries sensorium or clock pressure. Two mixed metaphors—“serene, golden twilight” after “sphere of that single, long-decaying note”—but they converge on light-as-sound, so coherence survives. No synonym churn, no scaffold; only one near-loop (“misting hush” twice in 50 words) forgiven because it is the pressure vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose carries high info density: each sentence layers metaphor with material action (“curves that flared outward like saddle shapes” advances fold AND geometry). Rhythm modulates—long cadences for library hush, staccato for snap release—without template loops. One mixed metaphor risk: “forgotten thought” + “vibrating weight” but resolved within two lines. No line artifacts touch closure beat; final sentence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with task: long clauses while dawn is harvested, staccato fragments as construct frays. Metaphors stay physically coherent—light as viscous pools, city as gold-violet architecture—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can anchor tripod, signal sunrise, imply archipelago sentience. Minor overworld “luminous absence” repeated three times, but each reprise reweights meaning, so penalty waived. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; closing line is crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances the warp of gravity or peels the ribbon. Metaphors are bold yet internally coherent—“velvet” fold yields to centrifugal hum without physics clash. Information density is high: the star is introduced, taught as keyhole, and paid off inside 90 words. Final line resolves by image (“her melody leading the way into a new life of volume and light”) that recharges the earlier silence motif. A single 0.1 reservation for “enveloped secrets” echoing twice in close succession, but the second instance is re-inflected by the sonic release, so the recurrence earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level propulsion is fierce: every clause either advances rotation of wrecks, tightens light pattern, or escalates bodily tension. Metaphors are disciplined—“crown of thorns,” “silent movie” memory—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; no filler stems. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line lands on sonic image (“her laugh, clear and bell-like”) that recharges orchard silence. One microscopic scaffold: “crisp nostalgia” is used twice; still, the second use modulates into sensory hallucination, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from curt sneers to longer crystalline clauses without falling into template cadence. Information density is high: tea-leaf read doubles as tactical instruction and emotional barometer. Zero paraphrase loops; “glass” recurs only when its state changes. One strained metaphor—“sound like a cracking glacier”—slips toward cliché amid otherwise fresh imagery, keeping the score just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (description + causality). Only minor scaffold: “the process was exhausting” could be shown via body. Metaphors are coherent within arboreal lexicon. No loops, no mixed vehicles. Density is high; one paraphrase loop near midpoint (−0.2). Closure image is clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or causality. Syntax alternates between sinuous preparatory clauses and hammer-blow fragments (“The mask was whole again.”). Mixed metaphors avoided—silence as syrup, weight as lead—stay coherent. Only hairline slip: “restless spirits” skirts cliché but is immediately re-tethered to material action.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances causality (“rain… erased the painted saints” hides the lever). Metaphors are spare and grounded: “vault’s broken archway” anchors spatially; no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Opening line anchors stakes and weather; final line resolves with image that recharges the tear motif. Proofing clean; no tense drift or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent (panic as lead spiderweb, vortex as kinetic memory) and do not obscure causality. Information density high: each sentence advances scene or concept. Minor scaffold: “the water here was…” repeats “water” but serves as topic pivot; not penalized. Closing line has crisp propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often delivers sensorial detail, backstory shard, and causal cue. Varied rhythm accelerates during lightning beat; no template cadence detected. Metaphors stay physical—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the mist curled… the mist into a glowing veil” repeats ‘mist’ without new pressure; −0.2 already reflected. Closure line clean.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.4)
    Rhythm is crenellated like gear teeth—long sentence hoists, short clicks at floor landings—creating sonic propulsion. Figurative language is spare except one taught cluster: shafts “turning the elevator shaft into a kaleidoscope,” immediately paid off by goggles’ spectral trick; metaphor stays physically coherent. Zero loops, filter-verb clusters, or scaffold; pronoun reference flawless; opening and closing lines perfectly book-end with image of ascent and sky.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify without algorithmic pattern. Information density is high: each sentence layers metaphor, sensory detail, and conceptual stakes. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled—mixed metaphor risk avoided by consistent atmospheric idiom. Minor scaffold: “the way the light curved around the memory” could trim two words, but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “fractally precise, repeating in ever-smaller iterations that defied the naked eye but sang to his tactile sense” does three jobs—image, metaphor, plot key. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with chalk strokes, then halts on “He dropped his hand.” Only hairline slip: “manufactured heaven” risks cliché, but context recharges it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “the violet bruise of twilight” does triple duty (color, injury, time). No synonym loops, no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (star = stowaway). Sentence variety propels momentum; paragraph cuts are clean. Tense and pronoun reference flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: sentences vary in length and opening, zero paraphrase loops, high density—“solvent distilled from the essence of twilight” does two jobs (world detail + stakes heightening). Mixed metaphors are avoided; obsidian peaks, bleached ribcage, metallic tree stump all cohere inside the same fossilized-leviathan lexicon. One microscopic tic: “sterile, blinding whiteness” is a touch familiar, but it is immediately recharged by the physical effect of “pinning the gears.” Closure sentence is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Syntax modulates from long aerial vistas to hammer-short clauses at pump ignition; no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Opening–closing resonance (“brambled hope” → “sturdy and real”) provides cadence payoff without redundancy. High information density per sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breath units and shard-like fragments that mimic clock ticks dissolving into hum. Information density is extreme—every sentence layers metaphor, sensory data, and conceptual stakes without paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent under physics-of-emotion logic (pane absorbs sound → emits color) and never contradict. Zero scaffolding, zero filter-verb stacks; even abstract nouns like “causality” are tethered to concrete cracks. The only restraint from 9+ is a single triple adjective cluster (“deep, violet light”) that could have been one precise color noun, but the cadence demands the pause.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for sea-swell cadence, staccato for vent-clatter. Information density is high—every sentence pulls double duty (world-rule + character state). No paraphrase loops; “mechanical birds” is repeated only when they crash, giving cadence payoff. Minor metaphors stay coherent (oil-weeping bark, copper leaves); one near-miss: “clockwork hearts ticking loud enough to be heard over waves” stretches physics, but the hyperbole is brief and character-colored.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but aerated: each sentence advances image, science, or emotion; no filler loops. Figurative layering (“liquid tapestry,” “song that refused to end”) is purposeful and paid off by the foam-to-silence arc. One mixed vehicle—“geological scar” beside “liquid tapestry”—barely grazes clarity. High-band ear; minor metaphor overlap keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence performs dual labor (advancing ritual while exposing obsession). Figurative language is patterned and paid off: frost-snapped violin string returns as bell-shatter. Information density high—e.g., “He calculated the weight of the missing joy the narrative had displaced” compresses historiography, commerce, and metaphysics in nineteen words. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges motif of refraction. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—each sentence layers geology, gastronomy, and emotion (“wet sand heavy and resisting her spade”). Figurative language is selective: two metaphors (shipwreck fortress, blizzard of screams) both payoff in closure image. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift; slight over-adjectival (“calcified reefs”) forgiven under lyric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She reached into her canvas satchel and withdrew a dense, cast-iron object…” simultaneously reveals tool, texture, and impending tactic. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (pinecone as “primitive anchor”). One mixed image: “linguistic weave” is near-cliché, slightly dulling the peak beat. Otherwise propulsive and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence fuses silica ridge, moonlight, epochal shift, and biological nostalgia. Metaphors are physically coherent—cracks “trap ghostly residue,” never mixed. Only minor scaffold: “trembling nights” → “trembling in her hands” is paraphrase-loop lite; it occurs at closure but does not obscure the image, so −0.3 rather than −0.8. Strong verbs dominate; nominalizations appear only when POV-plausible (“synaptic plasticity”).

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive: single sentences fuse sensory, spatial, and conceptual data (“the fog here was not merely water vapor; it was the breath of the mountain”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the physics of the world without contradiction. Occasional elevated diction (“clandestinely luminous”) is earned by the speculative register. Final image is crystalline: “the fire of protection burned silently overhead, unseen but ever-present.”

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; no scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are disciplined: “scream lines” is exact, “water pressed against eardrums” is sensory, not purple. Rhythm modulates—paragraph 1’s heavy caesuras mirror silence, final paragraph’s forward rush mirrors vibration. One clause (“silent suicide”) risks overkill, but the context is literal wood-fiber death, so it holds. Closure line is clean, image-driven, ear-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean yet textured; sentences perform double duty (e.g., “static charge…stinging vision” = sensory + stakes). One paraphrase loop spotted (“silence was not empty space; it was structured code”) but it is purposeful emphasis, not artifact. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines bracket narrative with sonic echo (horizon shimmer → stars lock). Minor scaffold: “he realized with sudden clarity” could compress, but beat is brief and does not dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyric: “the ghost of sounds, a symphony of attempts” compresses atmosphere and action in one breath. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; each figurative vehicle is acoustically consistent. Rhythm modulates from staccato forks to the long vowels of “warm, rhythmic thrumming,” accelerating into the single-sentence firework release. One minor scaffolding—“he realized”—slips in mid-epiphany, but it does not touch the closure beat, holding the 8.6 plateau.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines are dense and rhythmic; occasional lyric stacked metaphors border on excess but are pattern-taught early and never obscure causality or the closure beat, so the penalty stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; imagery ("shattered emerald," "whirling silence") is vivid yet never clots the action. No scaffold loops; every sentence advances skiff, body, or world rule. A single mixed metaphor—"unspooling upward in shimmering, cohesive ribbons"—barely grazes clarity. Closure beat is clean, propulsive, and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and double-tasking; only two adjacent near-repeats (“shifting mist…shifting wind tunnel”) slip into template cadence. Metaphors stay aerodynamic and consistent; no mixed vehicles. The final sensor “song” is earned, not grafted. Minor loop keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is patterned (light-as-sound, hush-as-weight) and paid off in closure. No synonym loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and stress. Single mixed metaphor (“ink into water” for aurora) is minor. Final line cadence slows to mimic re-crystallizing silence—line-level craft serving resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong verbs and varied sentence length carry the climb and descent; only minor scaffold (“the weight of it feeling different now”) slips into paraphrase. Mixed metaphors avoided; figurative language clusters only in the low-action wrap-up, not during the peak sonic beat, so clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes: long feverish clauses contract to staccato “equation remains unsolved.” Metaphors are consistent—halo as heart, stars as countdown—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected (“borrowed personalities” twice in adjacent lines) but does not touch closure. Information density high; every sentence advances atmosphere or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    High info density: single sentence layers task, terrain, sensory risk (“Tonight… exposed to the open sky”). Figurative choices stay internally coherent—jagged stone spine, syrup-thick time—without register drift or mixed metaphors at climax. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence starts vary; paragraph cuts clean. Proofing immaculate, no simultaneity errors. Closure image crystalline and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “His boots sank slightly into the wet loam, connecting him to the earth even as his mind sought to bridge the gap between the tangible and the ethereal” delivers setting, metaphor, and character paradox in one sweep. No filter-verb clusters; metaphors stay consistent (frost “weeping” extends the liquid motif without mixing domains). Clean temporal sequence avoids participle simultaneity errors. Final line “the burden it carried had been acknowledged, lightened, and finally released” offers a triad that cadences like ritual, earning its parallelism. Micro-slips like “surreal cathedral” are near-cliché but isolated, keeping this within hairline of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath of orchard description, then staccato “Recommence.” No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“ocean of non-existence”—but it is taught early and pays off when the cardboard raft actually floats. Sentences do double duty: “Her body dissolved into light and motion” advances both plot and image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: staccato for shaft descent, legato for core flare. Sentences perform double duty—e.g., “tying the broken pieces with the stuff of stage magic” simultaneously advances plot and reweights the silk. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; “azure defiance” is single, coherent metaphor carried to final line. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and paid off (“pressure of a deep ocean” mirrors the trance undertow). High information density: each sentence advances trance mechanics or emotional charge. Grammar clean; no scaffold. Final line lands on image, not explanation. Meets 9+ quick test with zero artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence music rises and falls with ascent/strike/bloom; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“glass-walled chamber that felt less like a shelter and more like a trap” is exact, not purple. Information density high: single clause often conveys motion, tool, and emotional valence. Minor scaffold: “the vibration of the sea floor humming through the tower’s bones” could lose “the vibration of,” but it does not blur causality or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet readable; sentences layer sensory, conceptual, and physics detail without paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“contained supernova,” “sword of green fire”) stay coherent within the mythic register. One mixed vehicle—“the storm…like a well-trained beast returning to its cage”—is minor. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp, recharging the light/shadow motif. No scaffolding or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary; no scaffold loops. “Quietly explosive” is oxymoron that earns its keep. Information density high—each line adds sensory or causal data. Metaphors stay inside optical physics logic; no mixed vehicles. Final line crystallizes without overwriting. Minor: “valley-mist wonder” borders lyric cliché but is saved by earned context.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density—figurative language is selective, never floods a beat. Metaphors (“vegetative nervous system,” “liquid mercury”) cohere without contradiction. One paraphrase loop (“heavy exhalations… heavy emotion”) but it does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm purposeful; no template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long anaphoric clauses mimic shuttle-motion, then a staccato thrust line—“she thrust the burning package.” No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; vehicles stay optical/textile. Minor scaffold in “glowing filaments...glowing core” but the repetition is purposeful thermal echo. Closure line—“some things, once woven, could never be undone”—lands clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Density is high: one line does setting + emotion + metaphor (“plastic fern became a lush, silver tree bearing fruit that glowed”). Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught, paid off. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening line anchors stakes; final line resolves by image. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “heuristically gentle” compresses years of trial into two words; sensory verbs (“cracked,” “overwhelmed”) drive sentences. Only two micro-loops detected (“the city would continue…” repeated intent), not at closure, −0.2. Metaphors stay physical and consistent (earth=brittle, bread=ghost). Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “shivered, hunting for a signal” gives motion, stakes, and tactile cold. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensorial or causal data. Metaphors stay consistent—light as quantifiable force, cold as entropy agent. The final paragraph’s triple plosives—“snapped,” “crack,” “pluming”—create audible after-echo without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong verb choices (“snatched,” “capped”), economical metaphors, and sentence variety propel without loops; only minor filter verbs (“felt like”) intrude. No scaffold or mixed metaphors in peak beats; closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or paraphrase; each sentence adds sensory or causal data. Metaphors (“atmospheric luggage,” “data-stream dowser”) stay internally consistent with travel and tech imagery. Rhythm escalates: staccato noun phrases during forest penetration yield to sweeping cadences on the bluff, mirroring breathing under thinning air. Minor 0.1 deduction: “aggressively reclaimed its wild, primitive roots” is a touch writerly, though it fits the nostalgic register.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the charcoal dragged across the paper with a visceral rasp” fuses sound, touch, and metaphor in one clause. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—quartz as natural frame, glow as auroral sorrow—no mixed vehicles. Zero scaffolding; every sentence advances stakes, body, or atmosphere. Clean copy, no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence propulsion is high; most lines carry both world-detail and pressure (“the Governor’s lie acted upon her like a herbicide”). One paraphrase loop mid-clerk beat (“there is nothing here but dust” / “his voice trembling”) costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors; zinc’s cold edge stays metallic, vegetal imagery stays chlorotic. Opening and closing sentences both anchor voice and reverb the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “thermodynamics of the sunrise” and “symphonies of truth” compress science and aesthetics in one breath. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances mass-loss, sound propagation, or interior color. Mixed metaphors are avoided; brass arm swings “low” under gravity, never violating physical logic. Filter verbs are minimal; perception routes through skin and bone. Opening and closing lines are anchored, lyrical, and reciprocal—ice’s first gleam becomes the final drip that silences the shout.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density—each sentence moves image or stakes. One paraphrase loop (“shimmered under the relentless sun…shimmering under a slightly different sky”) but spaced enough to read as reprise, not clutter. Mixed metaphors avoided; figurative language peaks only at compression climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density; most sentences do two jobs. Rhythm varies; no template cadence. One mixed metaphor: “cascading lanterns of purple light” then “grinding gears” is tonal whiplash but intentional. No loops or scaffolding; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse tech, body, emotion—“extension of her arm described a linear equation.” Figurative language is patterned, taught early, paid off: web metaphor for code assembly returns in final “web was finished.” No scaffold, no loops. Minor purple pulse in “millions of tons of water pressing” but fits peak beat. Final line crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape; no scaffolding loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent (obsidian water, velvet hush). High information density—each sentence does two jobs (image + causal cue). A single near-purple phrase (“terrestrially cosmic”) is earned by context and does not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long sensual opener to hammer-beat single-sentence paragraphs at reveal. No synonym loops or template cadence; information is double-loaded (“blood-red carnelian” does color + omen). Metaphors stay coherent—meteors as “scratches on a developed negative” fits photography-nerd Silas. Only one mixed image (“violent friction of entry”) barely grazes closure, keeping this under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from 5-word pulses to 35-word coils without algorithmic pattern; no filler verbs or filter stacks. Metaphors are spare and precise: “silent rivers of green and violet light” is fresh yet physically accurate. No synonym loops, no scaffold; “iron cylinder” never morphs into “metal rod” for variety. Opening line hooks voice and stakes; final line releases a scent-image that recharges every prior mention of rose and thorn.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences simultaneously advance lore, acoustic tactic, and atmosphere. Varied sentence length mirrors musical phrasing; no template cadence runs. Metaphors stay physically coherent (wind as reed-blown instrument). Two micro-loops—“echo forever… fade into silence” restated—dull momentum only briefly; no artifacts near closure. Proofing clean; pronoun “she” stays unambiguous throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “trapping the miniature winter scene inside a permanent, impossible swirl” fuses description with theme). Figurative language is sparse, never muddled; ice/candle metaphors stay consistent. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the shrine’s hush, tightening only in the sync beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors tide: long sensory accumulations, then curt whistle. Information density high—single sentence often layers tool, weather, metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are mirror-polished, earning final resonance. One template cadence in “he… he…” moon-stepping section prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify without template cadence. Information density high: one line can deliver atmosphere, character, and causality—“the diamond wobbled, the protective field around the orchard flickering.” No mixed metaphors; figurative language appears ≤1 per paragraph, avoiding purple swell. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Line-level artifacts do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the beat. Figurative language is selective: “cathedral of gritty whimsy” teaches tone early and is not over-milked. One scaffold echo—“the shadows he had weaponized”—appears twice within four lines; minor, but keeps the prose from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences perform double duty: “He uncorked the lullaby first, tilting the jar carefully over the open mechanism” shows gesture, stakes, and tactile caution in one motion. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (violet mist, silver vapor) is deployed once and paid off in the transformed sound. Syntax breathes—paragraph lengths vary from single-line crescendo to three-line denouement. Proofing is clean; the only micro-twitch is “bit, hesitated, and then turned,” where the comma after “then” is unnecessary yet harmless.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry dual duty: “the wool of his uniform heavy with the damp salt air” grounds body + setting in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each metaphor is single, physically coherent—“color of old bruises” recurs, accruing rather than repeating. Peak beat avoids purple: “key… became a waveform” is exact, not ornate. Opening and closing lines frame voice and reverb; minor copy polish on two comma splices would lift to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stakes or image. High density: “the freezing water created a conductive sheen that shimmered under the starlight” does triple duty (setting, physics, foreshadowing). Metaphor is spare and accurate—“coiled spring ready to snap”—never overwrought. Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; paragraph breaks punch the lever release. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors infrasound hum, accelerating into staccato upload beat, then easing into final lyrical cadence. Figurative language is selective: “weeping wound of concrete,” “cognitive residue,” each chosen to fuse body and infrastructure. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding; information density high—one sentence often fuses sensor data, memory overlay, and ethical calculation. Minor paraphrase loop at “silence that followed on the comms was heavy” slightly dulls the landing punch, keeping it sub 9.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid monotony. A few scaffold lines (“He approached the counter…”) could compress, but nothing loops or muddles causality. Figurative language is selective: “light breaks through storm clouds” is earned by the drape-pull and pays off in brass flare. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies from piston-short to thermal-loft long; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are machined-specific (“brass drums spinning the etched flight paths”) and never mixed. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, tool, and emotional charge (“He watched the storms fracture… into binary notches”). Minor scaffold: “the day of the Great Ascendance arrived, or at least that is what he named the Tuesday” could compress, but it is voice-motivated gallows humor, not redundancy. Closure image clear.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling toward the quiet reveal. Information density is high: each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and apt. The final paragraph’s “they were never meant to be found” lands as crisp, inevitable closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line craft is dense: “the groans echoing like the tectonic complaints of a dying world” fuses auditory and planetary scale in one image. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—light, ice, orchard form one cold-optic system. Minor scaffold: “shifting tattoos of the wars he had failed to prevent” could trim two words, but compression outweighs clutter. Closure line “the ice below seemed to stop its grinding” lands clean, sonic, symbolic.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
    <comment>Fresh synthesis: peacekeeper who weaponises alternate timeline memories via lighthouse-mirror optics feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—metaphysical retrieval inside a lighthouse junkshop—pays off by making empathy a literal beam. Transformation test fails if you swap shard for any other MacGuffin; its brokenness is integral to refraction mechanic. No close echoes of famous scenes; lighthouse-as-archive reframes maritime trope into temporal archive. Bold compression at 710 words proves high-concept can stay terse.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure: long clauses for suspended time, staccato for the parasol moment. Metaphors stay physically coherent—frozen vice, white vice, texture shift. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or motive. Minor intensifier “brutal context” is the single purple blip but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are varied, propulsive; figurative language appears sparingly and always tied to vineyard lexicon. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Opening line anchors stakes with bus dissolution image; final line “winter would not take this one” cadences cleanly. One mixed metaphor risk—“cage of autumn light trapping a creature of grief”—but “cage” is later released by wind, so coherence is restored.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with hazard: long sentences when sand is stable, clipped fragments when gears grind. Metaphors are sparse but precise—“treading on sleeping vipers,” “whispers… vibrated in his teeth”—no mixed vehicles. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances setting, stakes, or body. Heavy-water & silver-dust ritual could have slid into faux-alchemy, but the verbs (“poured,” “chanting,” “shadows… wrap”) keep it tactile. Final line—“season of fanatics had passed”—is the only faint editorial lift; otherwise the diction stays concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “metallic tang of oxidation” does triple sensory/contrast/history work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught—only the baseball arc repeats, and it pays off in the final sculptural curve. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge the motif without lyrical overture.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pressure or sensory flip. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate: “dictionary was a cage” arrives only after moss-as-key is earned. Information density high: “bioluminescent moss consuming the Biography section” does world, stakes, and visual in one stroke. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. A singleinstance of elevated diction—“Conceptual Repricing” zone—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: single sentences layer sight, sound, and metaphysical stake (“the damp air clung…softening their edges until they resembled ancient, unknowable monuments”). Figurative language is patterned—fog as curator, chalk as bone—paid off in closure. No loops or scaffold; each driftwood marker is unique. One register drift: “precognitively forgetful” is abstract, but immediately grounded in ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates with em-dash fragments and single-word imperatives during quake lurches. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances camera, body, or seismic stakes. Figurative language is sparse and physics-true (“vacuum of heat near his face”). Opening and closing lines are acoustically linked (“cold iron floor” vs “glowed now, a permanent lantern”), creating textural bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is almost loop-free; rare echo (“still broken” / “still” in next para) serves as thematic hinge, allowable. Metaphors stay physically coherent: “gray woolen blanket” for clouds sustains textile through “starched sheets,” no mixed vehicle pile-ups. Information density high—single sentences fuse sensory input, ethical calculus, object handling. Final line is ruthless cut with no scaffolding—“The silence that followed was not empty, but full”—achieves closure cadence without adornment.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; density high—single sentences fuse action, image, stakes: “He adjusted his spectacles, feeling a strange surge of nostalgic innovation.” Metaphors are controlled and non-contradictory: wooden body as “fallen statue” aligns with stillness, not elasticity. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges “constellation” motif with new emotional valence. Micro-variation in sentence rhythm keeps propulsion; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety is orchestral: participle openers, braided clauses, and single-word beats (“She inhaled.”) pace the lapidary drone. Metaphors stay coherent—leviathan ribs, jagged maw—without mixed logic. Information density is high; one line often does three jobs (setting, emotion, tool mechanics). Zero loops or scaffold; no synonym churn; the only near-purple phrase, “zephyr bloom,” is isolated and thematically earned, not repeated.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “swirling hush” does three jobs (sound, motion, temperature). Figurative language disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “liquid light” is singular vehicle. Varied sentence openings; paragraphs breathe. One paraphrase loop: “crushing weight of every sentence” / “crushing silence” −0.2. No scaffold. Final line propels off earlier “silence” motif. Could prune two adjectives to reach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long inhalation of opening sentence, then staccato grafting beat, final cadence of dissolving gold. No filter-verb stacks; “Elian adjusted,” “he grafted,” “he sang” keep propulsion. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors (cathedral, spring) and both serve spatial/texture mapping. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Line-level artifacts are absent; the closing “cooling brass” reprises the opening copper gear, giving tactile echo without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong propulsion: every sentence either advances ritual or heightens sensory density—no scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“blackened bones,” “mercury-like luminance”) and avoids purple overload; one mixed metaphor (“skeletal geometry”) but minimal clarity damage. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; sentences start varied. Final fused plate image provides clean cadence close. Minor –0.2 for mid-paragraph buried lead: vial introduction tucked inside long sentence; requires reread.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose density is high: each sentence moves (light shaft → sound map → timer calibration). Metaphors are coherent—timer as lung, cavern as bandage—without mixed vehicles. No synonym loops or paraphrase clutter. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously. Final line (“custodian of the past walking quietly into the snow”) offers image-based resonance without overwrought poetics. A single template cadence of three “he” actions in a row is the only line-level artifact; it does not touch the closure beat and is too minor to cap.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: “oxidizing floor,” “skeletal rib-cage,” “whalebone reverie” each do setting + metaphor + emotional tone in three words. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is patterned—water/bone/star—and paid off when starlight literally calcifies liquid grief to chalk. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene; no template cadence. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking; spatial prepositions (“toward the fissure”) precise.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: each sentence either advances the ritual or thickens atmosphere. Metaphors are spare and precise—“ghost audience,” “cellulose lattice”—no mixed vehicles. Filter verbs serve POV (“she visualized”) rather than dull immediacy. One paraphrase loop: “here and gone” repeated with identical phrasing; otherwise rhythmically varied.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “serrated plastic wheel from a disposable camera” packs world, class, and method in one noun phrase. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—”charged mercury,” “fractured stillness”—and culminate in the literal fracture of the horizon. Minor overwrite in “bruising twilight” is acceptable under lyrical pressure; it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “He treated the building like a dying patient, finding a vein that still carried blood” advances both character and tech.  Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors.  micro-turbine/pneumatic diction is accurate yet never explanatory dump.  The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors Elias’s calm, propelling closure without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, memory trigger, and metaphysical weight (“reeking of the world below the clouds”). Figurative language purposeful—mixed metaphors avoided, vehicles consistent with frozen-time logic. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or texture. Minor scaffold: “the wet stones” repeats twice within four lines near end (−0.2); does not touch closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence carries sensorium, world-rule, and metaphoric charge without clutter. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; “violin-string” cable and “nerve-ending” tension are clean extensions of Elias’s body-as-tool motif. Occasional elevated diction (“elegiac,” “rebutted”) fits his scholar-observer stance. Final line is shaved to monosyllabic cadence—“lowering the evidence back into the dark water”—propulsive and spare.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long fog-rolls to clipped “seed—now his.” No filter-verb stacks, no loops. Metaphors stay internally consistent (oceanic hush = pressure). One mixed micro-image: “mathematically impossible” hitch jolts against maritime diction; barely audible. Clean copy, high density.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for garden decay, staccato final lines for closure. High information density—each sentence layers sensory and emotional data. Metaphors are coherent: “void” → “silence in library,” “unraveling part of weave.” Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge motif.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors avoided; “woolly armadas,” “fractured night sky” are each internally coherent. High information density: every sentence advances ritual, memory, or sensorial stakes. Copy is clean; no loops or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm supports the final sustained note.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—description + causal cue: “dust was the only currency” embeds world-rule and economic stakes. Rhythm breathes during star-wait, then shortens at release. One mixed metaphor: “spiritual arteries” beside “calcified plaque” is forgivable in thought. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold; opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharged image cleanly.

    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long nebular sentences to the staccato “The gear turned.” No paraphrase loops; each image advances either navigation or grief. Figurative density is high but patterned—every metaphor (orchid gas, petal plasma) serves the garden conceit and pays off in the bioluminescent bloom. One mixed vehicle: “peace that felt closer to a tomb than a nursery” is allowed because it crystallizes the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers job: “ribbon roll clutched tightly to his chest like a talisman” simultaneously shows emotional stake, object presence, and foreshadows carving material. Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass as amber, butterflies as breathing rust—without register drift. Rhythm accelerates during ladder climb with fragmented clauses, then lengthens for the final carving exhale. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from lyrical elongation to hammered fragments (“The heavy bob rose…”), creating natural swing-and-pause rhythm that mirrors the pendulum. Information density is high: one sentence often layers setting, theology, and bodily risk (“He fed his acknowledged flaws into the iron heart…”). Zero loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, precise, and paid off. Closure line—“it beat in time with his beating heart”—condenses earlier motifs without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) without scaffold. Metaphors (“velveteen gloom,” “garden of shrouds”) are coherent and purposeful, not stacked. Near the climax, the cadence slows to match image settle, showing rhythm control. Minor paraphrase loop—“chaotic knot of conflicting colors” repeats essence twice—drops it from 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, high-yield: “probability becomes history” packs both physics and fate. No mixed metaphors; black ink / black spire reciprocity is intentional and coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the quill and vellum motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence can house sensory cue, world rule, and interior judgment (“radio dial glow burned with a steady, amber persistence—his hearth, his compass”).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Rhythm accelerates with the feverish ash strokes, then lengthens as rocker creaks stretch; no loops or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image or pressure—e.g., “swirling vortex of shadow and emotion” is abstract yet precisely calibrated to Elara’s gasp.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: “sedimentary layers of silt and trash” does world, history, and tactile action in six words. Figurative control tight—metaphors mechanical, never purple. Minor loop: “abrasive calm” repeated twice; justified by thematic branding but still a scaffold echo. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, pressure, or image. Metaphors are controlled: “curtains… drank the light” is apt physicality; “physics of empathy” is a one-shot coinage that pays off. Clause variety mirrors sonic tension—short percussive fragments during subtraction, longer legato lines during resonance. Information density is high: “zither soundhole rosette, carved from ancient spruce as thin and delicate as lace” does four jobs in eleven words.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; every sentence advances image or choice. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “the plant was absorbing…” tells what the prior tasting already showed. Final image line is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is selective—three vivid metaphors, not a flood—each serves tone or stakes. No loops or scaffold; “the hum of the city was dead” is clean, not padded. A single mixed image (“bruised apricot” sky) is minor; clarity at closure remains intact, but the prose is not quite hairline-flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty: advance, embody, reverb (“salt air stinging his eyes” = setting, sensation, consecration). No scaffold loops; each image appears once and recedes, preventing purple bloat. Figurative logic stays internally coherent—silence as calcified, blaze without crackle—so metaphoric density heightens rather than muddies closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif; paragraph cuts are surgical.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid mechanical pattern. High information density—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data (“foxglove-stained glass ampoule in her hand, the purple residue inside appearing black in the crushing gloom”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator jargon, not in-story language; no character utters it, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, reveals character, advances plot. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Occasionally elevated diction (“kinetic despair,” “conceptual repricing”) but justified by POV. Final image sentence is clean, propulsive, recharges “texture” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—moon-tipped brush, saffron quiet—and each vehicle stays coherent. Information density is high: every sentence advances image, motive, or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor (“bridge built of light and memory”) is minor enough to leave the 9-band within reach.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence carries both sensory data and forward motion. One minor loop: “the scent of toasted grain began to overpower the cloying rosewater” restates the prior sentence’s intent. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final image is unmarred by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: one sentence often couples sensory stroke with causal payload (“brine and exposed decay” anchors atmosphere while foreshadowing stone). Rhythm modulates—long breathless clause contracts to “He tightened the final screw.” Minor template cadence in two “He [verb]” opens but does not recur under peak pressure. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles or overwriting in climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; short percussive bursts under mirror climax accelerate heartbeat without drumbeat monotony. Figurative language is selective—one startling vehicle per beat—then recedes, keeping clarity. No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line resolves by charged image (quiet ruin).

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or filler; every sentence carries at least two jobs (image + causality, sound + stakes). Opening three words—“The endless ocean”—instantly establish personification and scale. No mixed metaphors; every vehicle (organ, cello, lattice) is acoustically coherent. The final line is a textbook echo of the first clause, flipped from menace to mastery, providing ear-memory closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; each sentence advances map, body, or machine. Metaphors are coherent: sun “flays,” architecture is “bone-white,” pattern “tightens” like a noose. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line resolves with charged image. No overwriting; density achieved via noun-verb precision rather than stacked modifiers. Proofing clean; no tense drift or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean, imagistic, rhythm-controlled; no loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening sentence tastes iron; closing sentence prunes garden—metaphor stays agricultural without drift. High density: single sentences fuse sensory data, historic echo, and foreshadowing ("ivy… dismantling the foundation stone by stone"). Clause variation supports momentum; no filler adjectives. Clean proofing, tense integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence lengths mimic tidal pull; opening compound clauses yield to fragment—“cold and insistent.” Information-dense lines do double duty: “brine mingled with the pervasive brine” locates scent and signals corrosion. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Minor −0.2 for two successive “smooth” verbs when sealing; clarity remains intact and closure beat untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold or synonym loops; every sentence advances image, causality, or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one punch. No mixed metaphors; “darkness became…a physical weight” is earned by subsequent tactile proof. Final line is an image-propulsion sentence that re-casts the earlier “artificial daylight” motif without repeating it—high information density with rhythmic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Syntactic variety avoids drumbeat; sentence lengths mirror emotional intake—staccato during fold, long lyrical release during flight. No paraphrase loops; each line advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent: “luminous torment” is literalized by violet sparks scratching sky. Opening line anchors voice and paradox; final line recharges “luminous torment” by letting the crane become it.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lines (“mathematical waste product of his tragedy”) do multiple jobs; only minor cadence echo around “tears floated/darkness rippled.” No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter; the final override key lands clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory: “the ocean… whispered in a sieved hush” marries sound to filtration logic. Information density high: “gardener of bloodlines who severed inconvenient branches” collapses occupation, metaphor, and moral transgression in one clause. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean, monosyllabic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “slick with the memory of a thousand torrential rains” fuses sensory and history in one clause. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is spare, never stacked; brass/rose metaphor arises from object, not imposed symbol. Final line lands on action, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence either advances kayak motion or deepens shame texture. Metaphors are physically coherent—“backlash of regrets snap against his ribs like a loose halyard”—and they recur with cumulative, not decorative, force. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold. The only micro-drag is the abstract phrase “internal north had been demagnetized”; if replaced by a concrete physical failure (e.g., “the compass spun like a drunken gull”) it would hit 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong information density—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without padding. Figurative language is selective and purposeful: “inverted cosmos of stalactites” mirrors the theme of reversed causality; no mixed-metaphor clutter. Some nominal padding (“structural integrity that had survived the impossible friction of temporal displacement”) could trim, but it doesn’t occlude causality. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful; zero paraphrase loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses: helical smoke, plummeting arc, bell tone—each sentence re-orients the body in space without scaffolding. Mixed metaphors are avoided; crystallized skin and ink shadows coexist in coherent physics. No synonym churn; “heat,” “fire,” “warmth” are never swapped merely for variety. Final third is artifact-free, propelling to the ash flake that lands the closure image. Information density high—one line often delivers sensory data, stakes reminder, and causal nudge simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for ascent, staccato fragments for dealing spiral. Information density high—“porcelain dish…drinking darkness”—compresses world-rule and metaphor in one clause. No mixed metaphors; vehicles obey internal logic. Minor template echo: “he had…he had…he had” in backstory block (−0.2), but outside closure zone. Artifacts do not touch final image; propulsion remains strong. Within hairline of 9.0; capped at 8.7 by that early scaffold ripple.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    High figurative density is pattern-taught early and paid off; mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional scaffold (“he did not push the feelings away this time; he breathed them in”) is brief and does not touch the closure beat; no template cadence loops.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density: “obsidian earth,” “bioluminescent swamps,” “pulsating neon abdomens” all in one breath without padding. Metaphors stay coherent—jeweler, fruit, spiral—no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “sheets of oppressive gold” marries visual and political weight. No filter verbs; perception is direct. Opening and closing lines act as volta—external blaze → internal lantern—without overwriting. One split-second tense stability in “had waited” is grammarily clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence carries dual duty of world rule and emotional charge. No loops, no mixed metaphors; “the bluff groan under the sudden, unnatural weight” is compact and exact. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“he saw the vector overlay”). Closure line is clean, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with timer ticks and storm bursts; no template cadence. Sentences layer job-multiplicity: “fumes spiraled up…marrying the smell of ozone with sharp alcohol” shows motion, smell, and chemical risk in one sweep. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new sensory or causal grain. Closure line is spare, letting image reverb without metaphor clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but never purple; each metaphor (clock-countdown arm, diplomatic riposte) is paid off by motion. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence rhythm accelerates with clash, then exhales at whisper. Information dual-loaded: “hydraulic force” conveys both tech and emotional pressure. One mixed metaphor—“unravel the other’s soul” slightly over-abstracts amid kinetic precision—drops the 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening structure; high information density—“sled of salvaged scrap metal” does triple work (object, effort, sound). Metaphors stay physically coherent: rust as veins, glass as diamonds. One mixed image—“violet bruise of the atmosphere”—is vivid yet risks color clash; minor. No paraphrase loops; each line advances scene or atmosphere. Final line cadence earns its declaration via prior image accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causation. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physics-loyal: "sky was a bruised purple" is immediate, not overwrought.

No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks, no late artifacts. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences open varied (“He raised…”, “To his left…”, “Thunder cracked…”). Metaphors are precise and physically coherent—no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; each line advances stake or texture. Peak beat—“seed held fast, rooting…”—remains uncluttered, letting rain blur serve cadence without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; each sentence layers job and atmosphere (“the needle froze, humming with a low vibration that resonated in Silas’s teeth” does triple duty); no filter-verb stacks in the climax; rhythm breathes with the ritual, accelerating only when the indigo ruptures.

Figurative language is pattern-taught (resonance, echoes, singing air) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “ambiguously clear ache”—slightly abstract—but redeemed by immediate embodiment (“sorrow that belonged to everyone and no one”). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “blooming withering” compresses paradox into two words; “gnarled as the dormant wisteria” fuses character and setting.

Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“He sat…”, “With practiced care…”, “However…”). Figurative language is coherent (light as canvas, music as key). Minor register drift (“transpose life into a new key”) borders therapy-speak but is redeemed by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences multitask (e.g., “The Vantablack... rippled, losing its perfect cohesion and trembling like water” conveys action, metaphor, and thematic shift). Figurative language is coherent—sound as architecture, silence as decor—but slightly thick in peak beats (“swirling architecture of grammar and negation”). No paraphrase loops; rhythm varies effectively. Minor overwriting in “metaphysical depths” slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-functional lines (“frozen lake stretched out like a paused breath” establishes setting, mood, and thematic stasis). Figurative language is coherent (musical metaphors sustain throughout), though “ghosting onto the transparent surface before fading into nothingness” edges toward slight redundancy. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold; high information density. Minor deduction for one borderline overwritten phrase (“delicate tuning” borders on cliché), but no artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied syntax and strong verbs (“shimmered,” “slammed shut,” “unfurled like a blooming, stone flower”). Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “stone flower” risks slight dissonance with earlier hard-edged imagery. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Deduction for one mixed metaphor: “darkening brightness” is potent thematically but borders on oxymoronic overload in the third paragraph. Final lines achieve crystalline clarity without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “jagged needle bit into the black wax with a violence that sent a tremor…” does triple duty (action, sensation, character). Minor overwriting in “filament of hush” metaphor risks abstraction but pays off in closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s “wind changing direction” slightly verges on convention but earns it through tactile buildup.
