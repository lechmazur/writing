  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with good sentence variety and momentum. Information density is high (ledger, uranium, arson, frost lessons) without bloat. Minor issues: "Her father's increasing fatigue. The strange beauty…" employs fragmented catalog rhythm that recurs in reflective beats, and "steadily adjusting" is slightly abstract. "The canyon walls echoed her footsteps, a drifting resonance…" borders on elevated diction but stays voice-plausible for a glass artist. No major loops or scaffolding; clarity holds throughout. The final paragraph's "drifting resonance" and "adaptive, patient, eternally seeking light" inch toward purple but do not obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high. Minor scaffold detected: "She had to rectify what the silence had stolen" reads slightly templated, and "silently expressive" recurs as a phrase-echo. Figurative density is controlled (frost patterns pulse, heat signatures bloom) but "unshaken marvels" in paragraph four feels forced. No loops or major clarity loss. The final paragraph's "silently expressive dance across the keys" mirrors earlier "silently expressive" without adding pressure—a micro-paraphrase that doesn't obscure but slightly dulls momentum. Overall propulsion is strong through the night's work.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.0)
    Figurative language is dense and often evocative ("bubble of breathable grief," "funeral flowers"), but clusters heavily in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity. Template cadence appears in the opening: "The package arrived... The weary undertaker set aside... Inside the sodden wrapping lay..." Paraphrase loops surface in the librarians' introduction: "They drifted... their eyes black holes of exhaustion" immediately followed by thematic restatement. The closure beat is charged but borders on overwriting ("silence bloomed like funeral flowers"), and the final note feels like scaffold rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    Syntax varies effectively and rhythm modulates with scene pressure (short, declarative beats during the officials' arrival; longer, reflective cadence at closure). Information density is high in the opening third, then thins during the six-month summary. Two paraphrase loops: "anonymous as always" echoes "anonymity preserved" within close proximity; "shifted in the settlement" / "something had shifted" recycles phrasing. Template cadence in the examples paragraph ("Teenagers began… Mothers shared… Men repaired…") applies −0.4. The final image ("echo lived on in every heartbeat") borders on abstraction but remains anchored in the bell motif. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished with strong figurative language and sentence variety. Information density is generally high. However, overwriting appears in stacked metaphors during key beats: "door... made of compressed starlight and forgotten promises," "voice like wind through bells," "moths toward flame." The opening "prayer written in stone" and "pilgrim of sparks" establish poetic register, but the density of figurative vehicles in every paragraph—especially "repository of unused love" machinery—slightly obscures immediate causality. Minor synonym loops: "sparks" recurs decoratively rather than with escalating function. Propulsion is present but textural density occasionally stalls momentum. No severe line-level artifacts, but the accumulation of lush phrasing in peak beats merits moderate penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (vines as memory, bridges as temporal pathways, photographs as discrete moments). Two friction points: "retrocognitive imprisonment" and similar coinages feel like concept labels rather than lived perception, and the final paragraph loops thematic summary across multiple restatements ("time's texture," "mutable," "living thing," "gardener") without advancing new pressure. Minimal scaffold otherwise; information density is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is high; no spatial confusion or timeline breaks. Sentence rhythm varies but slips into template cadence in the harvest sequence: "From the giant stuffed elephant... From the ring toss games... From the baseball pitch booth." The final two paragraphs loop thematically: paragraph penultimate declares "redemption itself" and "whispered gardens," then the final paragraph restates "secret garden at a time" and "slow, inexorable push toward light." "Staggering grace" in the penultimate line elevates diction without embodied justification. Information density is adequate but the closing beats over-explain rather than trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high. However, the piece shows pervasive overwriting: figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear payoff, mixed metaphors ("roots releasing soil" + "slow exhale" + "cell decides to divide differently" in one sequence), and elevated diction ("synesthesia," "auditory cortex," "ashen surface") that occasionally clashes with immediate physical pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "absence" and "spaces between" are restated multiple times without added detail. Template stems ("She [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]") recur across paragraphs. These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the closure image slightly, though causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled with vivid imagery ("sunset painting her features in honey and bronze"). Minor issues: "quietly savvy in her strange profession" in the final paragraph reads slightly label-only, and "carrying light between worlds" risks abstraction. A few lines border on overwriting ("moonbeams seeping through molecular gaps") but remain legible. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; information density is high. One figurative stretch ("moonbeams...like captured spirits") in the penultimate beat but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing Marina's work or the thematic frame. However, paraphrase loops appear: "each particle a former certainty" / "each sphere contained a hollow chamber" / "each one catching the last light" recycle the "each [noun] [state]" template across the piece, creating cadence monotony (−0.4). The phrase "strange comfort in the ritual" and "dangerous beauty of transformation" edge toward stock metaphor in reflective beats. Figurative language (glass as heart, thaw as emotional recovery) is consistent but dense across consecutive sentences in the middle third without variance, dulling propulsion slightly. No major causality breaks, so penalties remain in Q7 per the routing rule.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is mostly maintained, and sensory detail (rusted metal, star-pierced roof, seashell warmth) anchors the scenes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "his phobias suddenly made sense—they weren't weaknesses but safeguards" repeats the concept within two lines; "trembling certainty" and "trembling heart" bookend the story with near-identical constructions. Template cadence runs in the final third: "Marcus stood... Marcus pocketed... Marcus walked." The reversal mechanism—"reversed their resonance using the decoded formulas"—remains abstract, and Jake's sudden vertigo/hydrophobia/nyctophobia list feels like a checklist rather than embodied collapse. Some figurative language sharpens (shell "whispers turning sharp"), but "grinding metal" laugh and "trembling heart" veer purple in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is often lyrical and purposeful ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "retelling the story of the dying universe through the accumulation of its silences"), but density varies. Some paraphrase loops appear: "the star flickered—once, twice" followed by "she held her breath" and then another return to the star's behavior feels like minor synonym churn. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]." Figurative language is heavy in stretches (resin, honey, marble, veins of sound) without always advancing pressure, risking decorative weight. Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work but fewer drive plot or choice. Baseline −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for figurative density without payoff in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is strong: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies and the read-aloud test passes. However, paraphrase loops appear: "thoughts... emerged from the spaces between actions, from the pause between one mop stroke and the next, from the microsecond of processing" cycles the same idea three times without added pressure (−0.3). "Amalgamating" recurs four times, verging on synonym churn. Template cadence in the reflection block ("from X, from Y, from Z") stacks without escalation. The closure beat is clean, so caps apply to non-closure issues only.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in confession beats. Figurative language (lens as metaphor, forecourt acoustics) recurs purposefully and charges closure. Loop/scaffold issues: "resonant hush" appears three times, "ambiguously clear" twice, "crystal whispering forecourt" is template-repeated in opening and penultimate paragraph without tonal shift (−0.4 paraphrase/template). Elevated diction ("elaborate architectures," "sewn itself between them like a dark thread") occasionally clashes with night-registrar POV (−0.3 register drift). Propulsion is steady; no causality-breaking artifacts. Closure beats remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully ("They had started calling it the Luck Index three years ago" vs. "The jasmine's leaves trembled"). Information density is high in the ritual descriptions (marble polishing, wire spiral), and sensory detail is concrete ("clouded marble with a lightning-crack," "tea brewed from leaves that shouldn't exist"). Some minor loops: "precious" and "proof" are asserted rather than shown early, and "small victories elaborately" recurs without added texture. The phrase "wisely pragmatic approach" is filter-heavy and slightly external. No scaffold or template cadence harms closure, and figurative language ("blooming and withering," "cracks between what is and what could be") remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant figurative density in high-pressure beats: "time folded like origami," "honey through water," "web with every strand vibrating." Mixed metaphor: frost forming on surfaces "even as they glowed with heat" contradicts physics without pattern-teaching the paradox early. Template cadence: "She could see… She could see…" repeats stems. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 5–6 restate "icy warmth" and "paradox" without added pressure. Apply −0.9 total for density + coherence + loop issues, all touching the closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is generally strong, with details doing double duty (floating case as "patient dog" conveys both fact and Marcus's relationship to his instrument). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "in-between space, neither quite stage nor audience" is restated as "liminal space between performer and performance" later. The phrase "the water-damaged program showed a composition emerging line by line—not written but revealed, as if the flood were developing a photograph in reverse" stacks three explanations of the same phenomenon. "Wordless conversation" and "wordless exchange" repeat the same concept across paragraphs without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively, with shorter sentences during the aurora sequence accelerating pressure. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes simultaneously. Minor loop detected: "The truth of it rushed through her" / "whispered its story" / "swallowed this truth" / "carry this truth" recycles the abstraction across multiple beats without adding pressure. Figurative language (prayer flags, grief made visible, electromagnetic sorrow) is purposeful and mostly coherent, though "fault-tolerant" receives heavy conceptual load across the piece. No significant filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Propulsion remains strong through the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance atmosphere, discovery, or thematic weight). Figurative language is controlled: "metal tombstones," "circulatory system," "DNA strands" all serve POV without overwriting. Clarity remains strong through complex intercutting of radio fragments and tunnel exploration. Minor loop: "the weight of a swallowed truth" appears in two near-identical phrases ("the weight of that swallowed truth" final paragraph; "weight of a swallowed truth, the mass of collective guilt" midpoint)—the second instance adds specificity, so paraphrase penalty is light. No scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence runs mar the prose. Information density is high in description (refuge holds "only three things," swan folds "worn soft as silk"), yet several beats loop conceptually: "books became mulch became moss became memory" and "Facts decomposed into dreams, dreams crystallized into wisdom, wisdom dissolved back into silence" restate transformation without advancing pressure. Mixed metaphor appears in "burrowing through time itself, following root-paths of causality"—roots and burrows conflate. "Crumbling peace" recurs as a phrase without fresh context. No major scaffold or register drift; clarity remains high. Cumulative paraphrase and figurative density in the final third trigger −0.6, landing the score in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several artifacts dull momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "ordinary magic lived in repetition, in ritual, in the careful tending of small moments" recycles near-synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "through moves and divorces, through Sofia's teenage rebellion...through her own mother's death" stacks parallel prepositional phrases. The metaphor "violin string from the moon's orchestra" is vivid but the corona "harmony that sounded like every lullaby ever sung" edges toward abstract stock poeticism. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "seemed to link") slightly flatten immediacy. These issues cluster in the first two-thirds; the eclipse beats tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean with high information density and varied rhythm. Strong images: "broken birds," "echo rather than sight," "bronze-quiet." Sentence structures vary purposefully. Two modest frictions lower the score: (1) "The dragons on the tapestry began to move. No—she was moving" employs a micro-cliffhanger deflation pattern; (2) "her sensitively perceptive awareness" and "that particular grace" use filter-adjacent constructions that slightly dull immediacy. No loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language (trees remembered as spines, walls breathing) is coherent and supports the accumulative texture. The opening and closing images effectively frame the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm and strong imagery (lighthouse beam, fortune slips as sheet music). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "everyone's hiding something everyone already knows" / "open secrets"; "accidentally prophetic, deliberately vague, perfectly precise" stacks modifiers without adding pressure. The phrase "the island's elaborate pantomime of coincidence" and similar constructions elevate diction beyond immediate scene needs. Template cadence in the middle (listing fortunes and their recipients) slightly flattens momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, paragraph lengths breathe, sentence openings diversified. Information density is high in the loop-building beats. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops cluster: "The sound wasn't music—it was architecture" is then re-explained across the next paragraph; "stillness" is looped four times in two paragraphs ("motionless," "stillness so complete," "mistake stillness for death," "what is stillness except motion"); "unravel" appears three times in the final third without reweighting. Template cadence in the thematic declarations ("I am assumption," "I am the unexamined life," "I am the automatic yes") flattens voice. Mixed metaphor: "indigo of pre-dawn doubt" as paint color, then doubt as doorway, then silence as decoration—vehicles collide without synthesis. Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the mid-passage without clear pattern payoff triggers density penalty (−0.5 in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and figuratively dense, but density becomes a liability in high-pressure beats: "space between sound and silence, between memory and prophecy, between the child... and the woman" stacks parallelism without propulsion. Several paraphrase loops appear (fortune slips described multiple times as spiral/pattern; "chronologically homesick" restated). The climax—fortune slips swirling, Mei conducting—lacks concrete action sequence; metaphor obscures what physically happens. No major grammar issues, but overwriting and template cadence ("each fortune became...") dull momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density runs high throughout ("pulsing with bioluminescent moss," "shadows that moved independently," "grasping fingers made of might-have-beens") without clear pattern-teaching or escalation—the metaphorical register stays constant rather than modulating with pressure. Several lines loop conceptually: "fractured timelines" / "labyrinth of self" / "periodically eternal" recur as labels without fresh embodiment. The phrase "darkening brightness" appears in both the prompt-tone element and the final paragraph, feeling forced. Template cadence in the opening: "She clutched…She could see…She had to…She understood." Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty, but scaffold phrasing ("The viaduct stretched," "She pressed the tablet's largest rune") stalls momentum. The penultimate paragraph's exposition ("The labyrinth…hadn't been conquered—it had been integrated") summarizes rather than showing integration through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with vivid imagery ("stone walls remembering," "each note arriving before its own birth," "tender shoots of feeling"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and technical details (phonograph spring, vinyl grooves) anchor the physical world. However, paraphrase loops and template stems appear: "The backward songs unwound time itself, peeling away…" followed by "The cavern's walls began to resonate with frequencies…" restate the same content. The final paragraph over-explains with scaffold phrases ("she understood now," "she had discovered," "had taught her this"), undercutting the preceding images. Minor filter-verb stacking ("she felt," "she understood") in the closure diminishes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and information density is high with most lines advancing character, plot, or atmosphere. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop issue: "layered quiet" and "layered tranquility" restate the same concept across paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). The phrase "progressing laterally" appears twice in different contexts (movement pattern, then observational shift), creating mild synonym churn. One scaffold moment: "Now, in the layered quiet of her courtyard, she understood" could be tightened to "She understood" without loss. Figurative language ("wings cutting through amber light," "currents of revolution") remains controlled and does not overload peak beats. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Show me another layer" / "Pattern it forward" / "The final layer revealed itself" follow identical stems. Abstract phrasing ("moral complexity," "cosmic scales," "dimensions that yesterday he couldn't have imagined") replaces concrete action. Stock metaphor string: "Time had texture here, rough like the rope's weave, smooth like worn clay, sharp like the moral edges." Figurative density in high-pressure beats (−0.5), template cadence runs (−0.5), and abstraction in the closure paragraph (−0.4) accumulate to −1.4 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "broken teeth," "canvas of quietude," "ash-dusted." No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor density slip: "This was not the polished performance Echo Harbor had once prized. This was rougher, more honest" restates across two sentences without added pressure, costing −0.2. The final image ("perfect incompletion") recharges earlier motifs cleanly. Propulsion remains strong through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with strong images ("burgundy streak," "static electricity still tingled on her fingertips"). Information density is high in the grotto beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "half-truths trapped inside" / "emotions that were genuine once, but incomplete" / "honest in its incompleteness" rehash the same idea across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the harvest sequence: "A father's pride divorced from disappointment. A lover's passion without the subsequent betrayal. Joy untethered from its inevitable loss" is purposeful parallelism but borders on list. The penultimate paragraph's long reflection ("In her profession, she'd learned...") summarizes rather than propels, and the final clause ("each one a small mercy in a world that often loved too sharply") leans sentimental. Minor scaffold in "This was why her work succeeded" and "This was the crucial moment."

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is strong. However, the final paragraph stacks abstract metaphors ("currencies beyond her careful calculations," "tidal certainty," "shadow into starlight," "symphony notes across the water") in rapid succession, creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "understanding finally" echoes earlier reflective moments. The closure beat's figurative language obscures rather than sharpens the on-page consequence. Mid-story prose is clean and efficient; opening and middle beats maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally clean with no major grammatical errors, but the piece suffers from pervasive overwriting and template cadence in mid-scene beats: "each translucent fruit catching fire," "luminescent ache of belonging finally found," "pillars of light," "fallen stars." Paraphrase loops appear ("stories into the black volcanic glass" / "sculpting their stories into obsidian") and the final paragraph stacks modifiers without propulsion ("dark beauty of obsidian and the golden promise of marsh reed under endless, forgiving light"). The scaffold phrase "a monument to some lost purpose" → "testament to the webs" → "mirror, reflecting back" recycles conceptual synonyms without added pressure. These artifacts cluster in the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and structure; information density is high with multi-job lines ("water flowing impossibly upward between the towers, defying gravity through ancient engineering"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is purposeful ("time's natural rhythm skipped," "time itself resumed its natural, uninterrupted flow"). Minor: "interrupted cadence" appears three times, and "borrowed time" recurs slightly more than pressure requires, edging toward motif over-signal without crossing into artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "presence and absence," "here or gone, alive or dead," "disappeared and death" are restated across adjacent lines. The metaphor stack in the final third ("loss...incomplete proofs in emotion's infinite equation") layers abstraction without grounding in concrete image. Template stems recur: "She'd spent months mapping," "She'd puzzled over this phrase endlessly," "She left the glass eyes...knowing she'd return." Figurative language in the closure beat ("buried optimism...bloom into understanding," "ancient arithmetic") elevates diction without clarity gain, triggering a −0.5 deduction for density and coherence drift in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm variation and concrete imagery. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot simultaneously. Opening and closing images (lights dying/steadying, dawn through windows) frame effectively. Minor issues: "kindly, methodical acts of providence" and "careful guardian, the keeper of sense memories" edge toward abstraction where concrete action would be sharper. The phrase "cascade of sense memory" is slightly generic. One near-loop: "carefully, methodically" in paragraph four echoes "mindful" and "carefully" from paragraph one without adding pressure. Still, no major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines advancing atmosphere, character state, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled and coherent ("watercolor on wet paper," "tiny lens focusing something larger"). Minor loop detected: "reluctant metamorphosis" appears in both early exposition and near the end, creating a faint paraphrase effect. One register wobble: "participatory transformation" and "subjects" in the middle section skew slightly academic for the voice, though they stay within Marcus's scholarly idiom. No artifacts touch the closure image, which remains vivid and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is propulsive and information-dense: "mixing pigments with tears when water grew scarce" delivers backstory, character skill, and world-state in nine words. Rhythm modulates effectively from the opening's syntactic complexity to shorter beats during the exchange. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor density slip: "The patterns reminded her of the neural pathways she'd studied in art school, before the world cracked open and bled its oceans dry" front-loads metaphor in a reflective beat where leaner phrasing would maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong figurative coherence: "futures branching like silver threads," "sugar in rain," shadows that "breathe and shift." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. However, template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "The [noun]" constructions explaining theme, and the final two paragraphs loop conceptually—paraphrasing "everyday magic" and "bright darkness" across adjacent lines without advancing pressure (−0.4). The shadow-presence's exposition flattens momentum mid-piece. Opening and closing images are vivid, but scaffolding phrases ("Now you see," "understanding at last") tell rather than trust the dramatized transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is largely clean with varied rhythm and strong imagery ("salt crystals clung to every surface like memories," "droplets on windows"). Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding of the archive or exile. However, several text artifacts dull momentum: "staggered intervals" recurs as formula; "fragments" appears in template patterns across multiple paragraphs; the phrase "compile fragments into meaning" loops without adding pressure. The final paragraph's triple construction ("we are here, we were there, we are the sum") edges toward summary rather than image. No major loops obscure causality, keeping damage non-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm. Information density is high in the mist-walk sequence. However, several loops and scaffolds dull momentum: "trembling certainty" appears twice (opening and close), "cartographer's eyes/training/mind" recurs without variation, and the final paragraph paraphrases prior content ("mysteries weren't meant to be solved but navigated" restates the central conceit). Template cadence surfaces in the vault description: "conversations never finished, words swallowed before birth, confessions that died in throats" stacks parallel phrases that blur into synonym churn. The figurative density in the fortress beat ("architecture composed of all the things humanity couldn't quite bring itself to say") remains coherent but abstract. No filter-verb stacks or timeline confusion; syntax varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with good rhythm variation and selective sensory detail. Opening and closing images anchor well. However, several paraphrase loops reduce density: "The whales' migration would last three days. Three days during which Elena could choose..."; "Some truths require sculpting absence... clearing room for what we don't yet understand" restates without adding pressure. Figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff ("entangled," "hidden sympathies," "unheard symphony") and mixed metaphors blur sense ("sculpt space," "formula for transcribing sympathies"). Filter verbs cluster in reflective beats ("felt warm," "found herself placing," "realized she was documenting") without voice justification. Template cadence appears in summary passages: "not quite music, not quite mathematics," "not of songs or stars, but of the space between."

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("obsidian surface drinking light," "light through heavy water") is purposeful without overwriting. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the crew of the Meridian Splice, humanity's first interdimensional vessel" repeats content from the prompt rather than advancing knowledge. Template cadence in the middle ("She pressed... Through it, she watched... They moved...") creates a march rhythm. The final paragraph's "something after goodbye" is repeated from earlier, and "whispering stories of those who chose to discover what lay beyond forever" is an expository summary rather than a charged image. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so deductions remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately; opening line anchors voice and object. Information density is high in the prep-room action beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in figurative cluster: "liquefying," "dissolving," "liquefaction" of Wei's emotions within three paragraphs reads as pattern-forced rather than varied. The "stroking/massaging/threading" embalming sequence is concrete and propulsive. Clarity is mostly strong, though "deathly vitality" (prompt element) lands as oxymoron without sufficient setup. One scaffold phrase: "precise and deliberate" is generic where specific gesture would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor well. Information density is high in the lamp-hum passages. However, paraphrase loops appear: "invented histories of places that might have existed" (para 1) and "invented back into existence" (final para) restate the core conceit without added pressure. "The bonsai masters had told her their trees remembered everything. Not metaphorically, but literally" over-explains what the following sentence already demonstrates. The phrase "her profession demanded such faith" tells rather than shows. Minor template cadence in the middle: "She crouched...She believed...She began" across adjacent beats. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure passages.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; sentences layer world-building, character history, and thematic texture efficiently. Figurative language (poison label as compass, memories refusing to die correctly) enriches without overwhelming. However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "She began visiting… she would read… she wrote about… she wrote about…" creates a repetitive stem pattern across four sentences. A paraphrase loop occurs when "erased histories" and "dissolution" are restated across adjacent lines without added pressure. Clarity and momentum remain strong overall, but these artifacts prevent entry to the high band. No loops touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("broken crown," "pale as driftwood," "ghost frequencies"). Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates appropriately. Minor scaffold: "She'd come to investigate" and "she realized" filter slightly where direct perception would sharpen. The phrase "simultaneously ancient and immediate" in the voices Marina hears is abstract and could be more concrete. No loops, template cadence, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Information density is high, and the final image closes with resonance rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor loops appear: "foundation stone chip" is named six times with similar framing, and "perpetual" recurs three times in close proximity. "Hopeful desperation" and "orderly intuitive" are repeated without evolving meaning. The phrase "before privatization carved up the water rights" and "ungoverned and ungovernable" edge toward lyric inflation. The ending paragraph stacks assertions ("unbreakable," "protected," "still free") rather than trusting the image. Overall momentum is strong, but closure beats carry redundant claims that dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong sentence-level propulsion: "She'd outlasted them all—the other inspectors, the mining crews, even the administrators." Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. Two minor loops appear: "purposefully curious" in paragraph one echoes "remained purposefully curious" in paragraph eight; "dawning hush" recurs in near-identical phrasing across paragraphs three and nine without sufficient reweighting between uses. Figurative density is elevated in reflective passages ("Earth hung pregnant," "crystallizing instantly in the vacuum before sublimating into nothingness") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs; clarity and momentum are sustained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean with strong imagery (water beading and rolling, vortexes in mist, copper filament thinner than spider's silk). Minor artifacting: "magnetic calm" recurs three times as a label, feeling promotional. The phrase "where broken things waited to be understood" in the final line is slightly precious. Sentence rhythm varies well, though the middle repair sequence uses repetitive stems ("Maya positioned...She released...She murmured...Her tools moved"). No severe loops or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong sensory specificity ("cataract eye," "dendritic pattern," "worrying tranquility"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, discovery, or character. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Minor issues: "a herald's gesture she'd learned to interpret" tells rather than showing the falcon's behavior, and "the kind that preceded avalanches" is a stock comparison. No loops or scaffolding, and the condensation-as-map beat is elegant. The final paragraph risks slight overwriting with "rosetta stone for reading the language of ice and time and patient water," but it stays voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the middle section (spiral dance, steady march, gentle skip compressed into one beat). Two paraphrase loops: "The town's bells had been silent for months, their towers cracking, their bronze voices stilled" restates silence unnecessarily; "While other towns crumbled...Millhaven's stones held firm, bound not by mortar but by the daily ritual" loops the premise. Template cadence in the restoration catalog (cracks seal, archway straightens, fountain weeps) flattens propulsion. No figurative muddle, but "wild hush" recurs without evolving.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence structures and strong nouns (sanctum, gossamer, cartographer). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "She could join them. One breath without the compound, and she would unsnarl..." restates the choice already dramatized; "lonesome splendor" and "gathered hush" recur as stock phrases across multiple paragraphs without evolving meaning mid-text. Mixed metaphor: "whispers" that cause loss, "walls seemed to breathe with accumulated prayers," and "water itself formed architecture" stack figurative language in adjacent beats without coherent vehicle. Minor: "nitrogen narcosis" as a named threat for others but not Maya creates slight credibility friction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and strong imagery (copper light, lattice shadows, scuffed door). Some overwrought constructions: "threading his way...like smoke through a keyhole," "hover-carved itself into the wood." The phrase "chasing hush" recurs but remains abstract. Minor paraphrase loop: "copper light" appears three times in close proximity without added pressure. The final paragraph shifts into summary mode, listing outcomes rather than landing on a concrete image. No significant loops or template cadence, but density could tighten in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with strong imagery (glass walls catching no light, tears of amber resin). However, ornamental density accumulates: "ephemeral cameos," "mournful elation," "lovingly venomous affection," "resonant awakenings" cluster in adjacent paragraphs, risking overwriting. The phrase "ghosting through his life" is a contemporary idiom misplaced in the established gothic register. Minor paraphrase loop: "beautiful, venomous love" in the penultimate paragraph echoes "lovingly venomous" from earlier without adding pressure. Figurative language in most sentences of the climax beat ("terrible beauty—skin like moonlight on snow, eyes dark as…") works but trends toward density saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is rhythmic and imagistic with high sensory density. Sentence variety supports the lyric mode, and figurative language (nautilus spiral, threads that "wouldn't exist until tomorrow") is mostly coherent. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "new threads to gather, new paths to walk, new hope to stitch" stacks parallel infinitives without added pressure. A paraphrase loop between "sewing invisible threads" and "stitching new myths" recurs across beats without development. Minor scaffold in "the world was learning to breathe again" (abstract summary) dulls momentum near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "bees building hives in the hollow of an ancient ossuary" advances setting, tone, and world logic simultaneously). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs (shadow, sundial, bones). Minor loop detected: "interrupted journeys" in paragraph three is paraphrased as "every departure had been a return postponed" later, creating conceptual redundancy. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("bronze surface green with age," "trees twisting through gaps in the limestone") without overwriting. One small deduction for stock metaphor: "ancient olive trees twisting" edges toward familiar phrasing, though the specificity of "roots embracing skulls and femurs" rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (each line advances setting, ritual, or theme), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, a paraphrase loop appears in the opening third: "Its brass fixtures catching the first light" and "The arcade's skylights began to glow gold" restate the dawn-light motif without added pressure (−0.2). A template-stem cluster in the middle ("She was…She had developed…She consulted") adds slight cadence monotony (−0.3). No loops touch the closure beat, capping deductions under the non-closure rule.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance plot, character texture, or intelligence mechanics. Rhythm varies effectively between longer atmospheric sentences and short tactical beats. Minor scaffolding appears: "Each flicker cast shadows that revealed adjacent possibilities" tells mechanism rather than showing it in use; "paths that existed alongside the obvious ones" paraphrases the same idea. Template stems recur lightly ("she'd just marked," "she'd spent years"). The blood-smear encoding and flame-threading show strong concreteness. Opening line ("bruise against the sky") and closing wind-whisper create effective frame. No loops obscure causality, but synonym variation for "stitching/embroidering/threading" edges toward decorative in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("roots twisted like frozen screams," "condensation rose like morning mist"). Two paraphrase-loop moments: paragraphs describing the shard's purpose ("channeling rain...channeled something else," then later "channeled her fear away from love") restate the same metaphor without added pressure, triggering a −0.2 deduction. Stock metaphor in "eyes like broken glass" and "moonlight pooled like mercury" are present but don't muddle peak beats. Information density is high; no scaffold sentences. One simultaneous-action error: "she pressed the shard against her chest, feeling its ancient stone pulse" reads as sequential but uses participial construction. Closure beat is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is controlled (coral as neural map, butterflies as transformation language). Information is layered efficiently—backstory anchors to present stimuli without stalling. Two frictions: "that lotus-hearted ache she'd carried…not quite grief, not quite guilt, but something that bloomed between them" is a mild paraphrase loop (the negations circle the same space), and "its convolutions suddenly resembling a map of neural pathways, or perhaps the branching routes of human connection" stacks two vehicles without adding pressure. Neither touches closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the middle (festival reconstruction, network mechanics). Two minor loops: "knowledge network" appears identically phrased three times in close succession (−0.2); "joy" and "fog" recur in formulaic opposition across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). "Light-painting" and "photon" feel mildly label-heavy in peak beats but remain legible. No simultaneity errors or grammar slips. Opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line recharges the daydream motif with image over assertion. Propulsion is steady, though mid-story exposition (network explanation, original-artist backstory) slows the beat slightly without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "painted dreams began to move" → "Each nested layer rotated independently" restates the same visual without added detail. Template cadence runs in the middle section: "She pressed... She laughed... She flipped... She caught..." Stack of subject-verb constructions flattens rhythm (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: "voice fracturing into harmonics" clashes with "creating a rhythm that the garden's architecture transformed into a heartbeat"—sound becomes rhythm becomes heartbeat without coherent vehicle (−0.3). The opening line's "spiral of interlocking dreams that seemed to pulse" is vivid, but "seemed" hedges immediacy. Information density is uneven: the three-month restoration backstory is summarized in one clause, while the coin's shadow effect receives prolonged abstract description.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance multiple elements (character, world, pressure). However, figurative language clusters densely in places without always earning its space: "small revolution," "photosynthetic rebellion," "spark of defiance" approach stock metaphor strings. The opening "symphony Marcus had cultivated" and "sanctuary of glass and chlorophyll" read slightly elevated for the urgency of the situation. Clarity remains strong, spatial choreography tracks, and no paraphrase loops appear. The final paragraph's stacked abstractions ("ecosystem," "orchestrated interference," "collective consciousness") slightly dull immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in image-stacking beats. Two issues lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loops—"approached dancer" / "approaching disasters," "seed would be weapons no more" / "flowers would cease being grenades"—restate concepts without added pressure. (2) Mixed metaphor: "Seeds would be weapons… Flowers would cease being grenades of beauty that exploded in hearts, leaving shrapnel of longing" strains coherence (seeds ≠ flowers as grenade, shrapnel of longing blurs vehicle). Template cadence in the catalogue paragraph ("betrayals pressed… abandonments crystallized… deaths ground") triggers −0.4. No loops touch the closure beat, so the penalty is capped.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats (the orchid-shaping sequence). Clarity is strong; no causal breaks. However, several passages loop conceptually: "deserted marvels" appears twice in similar phrasing, "gently systematic" / "methodical rituals" / "practiced grace" / "measured steps" / "characteristic measured steps" recycles the same trait across multiple beats without added pressure. "The opal library hung suspended" / "The opal library would continue floating" bookends without transformation. Figurative language ("foxglove regret, beautiful and poisonous," "constellation of soft luminescence") is dense but mostly coherent. Template stems ("She was," "She reached," "She carried") cluster in the middle third. Deduct −0.8 for paraphrase loops and stem repetition; strong closure image mitigates further loss.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally with strong opening and closing images; the glass ink well catching lamplight and clinking softly bookend the piece effectively. Information density is high—each paragraph advances discovery, translation insight, or stakes. However, minor template cadence appears in the discovery beats: "She was carefully reckless," "She laughed," "She packed," "She would teach" creates a repetitive stem pattern across key moves. The phrase "before paths diverge" recurs twice (title context and final paragraph) without added meaning, edging toward loop. No paraphrase cycles or major filter-verb stacks, and technical detail (Verithanic script, pearl-infused ink) reads purpose-driven rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns accumulate: repeated "She'd" openers in early paragraphs, synonym churn around "breathing/exhale/inhale," and template cadence in the planning sequence ("She began to tremble… She carved… She designed…"). The phrase "encrypted compassion" and its variants ("encrypted compassions") appear multiple times without added pressure. "Slyly heartfelt" and "dappled resolve" read as ornamental rather than scene-driven. The closure beat ("The floodgates would open in new patterns soon. The water would remember…") is clear and propulsive, but the accumulation of figurative language in the final two paragraphs ("star-drunk night," "dappled resolve") slightly obscures immediacy. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and synonym loops; escalate to −1.0 for ornamental phrase recurrence in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and strong imagery (dust motes as constellations, meteorite "no larger than a pigeon's heart"). Template cadence appears in the seasonal transformation passage: "First came the withering…Then winter's quiet work…Spring brought…By summer, she had balanced." Figurative density peaks in several beats without always advancing pressure—"swirl gradually revealing patterns," "truth lived not in official records but in the spaces between words"—though most serve the accumulative design. Minor paraphrase loop: "preserve the echo" recurs without added cost. Information density is high overall, but the final two paragraphs summarize rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and vivid imagery. "Featherly determined" and "fractured hush" recur without pattern-payoff—decorative rather than causal. Minor loops: "necessary distances" appears four times without evolving meaning; "sacred" and "threshold" churn across paragraphs. "Drifting prism terrace" and "pneumatic supports" supply texture but the terrace's drift never affects action. No major artifacts obscure closure, but density is uneven—some sentences (sunset casting rainbow shadows) add atmosphere without advancing pressure. Line-level clarity is strong; momentum sags slightly in the reflective middle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is mostly strong: varied syntax, concrete nouns, clean grammar. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Two minor issues: "She was softly ingenious in her approach" tells the trait rather than showing it through action, and the phrase "what scholars called Thymal—though its true name had dissolved into the sea" carries slight passive scaffolding. The final paragraph's "understanding finally" and "feeling the vibration" lean toward summary rather than concrete image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "joy through frosted glass," "dandelion wishes on an uncaring wind," "bells wrapped in velvet," "trying to understand the ocean by collecting foam." While vivid, the metaphors cluster heavily in reflective beats without always advancing causal pressure, and some vehicles contradict physical logic (foam slipping through fingers, yet she's made of sea-foam). Template cadence appears in adjacent paragraphs: "Perhaps paths grew tired… Perhaps they simply forgot… Or perhaps…" Baseline −0.6 for density and scaffold loops; no closure-beat opacity, so no escalation beyond that range. Information density is strong in the opening and closing, but middle paragraphs loop thematically without tight propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and information density is high: most lines advance action, character habit, or atmosphere. The opening ("positioned... calculating sight lines from three different tourist flows") packs spatial and tactical detail efficiently. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "orchestrated chaos" is restated as "ordering randomness" and "calculated wilderness," then "randomness into moments of wonder"—synonym churn across the middle third. The phrase "between acts, he reset" and "between acts, he studied patterns" use identical stems. Template cadence emerges in the performance-cycle paragraphs (family, teenager, late-evening couples, bar crowd, insomniacs) with parallel structure that becomes mechanical. Apply −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template runs; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "obsidian grace," "ink waiting to be written," "cosmos speaks through flesh," "incantation," "patient light." The metaphors pile without clarifying mechanics or choice. Paraphrase loop: "The moonstone dust began to glow... The dust multiplied impossibly" restates transformation. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She" or "Mira" in paragraph 2–3. Register drift into cosmic abstraction flattens urgency at the climax. Artifacts pervade the final third, preventing 9+ globally and capping high bands at 8.8 per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character insight, or thematic resonance. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer contemplative sentences interspersed with sharp physical beats (stone leaving hand). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Deductions: "This was how he communed now" and "Marcus understood this was the last morning" are scaffold phrases that externalize rather than embody. The phrase "illuminate value in the mundane" recurs as a thematic label without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in the opening third ("he'd built," "he'd installed," "he pulled") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines do double duty (character and world, image and pressure). Two distinct artifacts lower the score: the phrase "hard softness" / "harder and softer" / "violent tenderness" creates a template cadence of oxymoronic pairings across three beats, and "the boy who'd died had made no such bargain" followed by "The wind shift had come like a predator" loops conceptually around the same grief without advancing detail. The opening and closing images are strong, but the middle third occasionally substitutes metaphor density for concrete action. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "trial balloons," "hope equation," and "altitude gauge" recur as label-only anchors without new pressure. Template cadence appears in expository blocks ("She'd mapped," "She'd become," "She would"). Stock metaphors—"woven into the mathematics," "constellation of lights"—appear in the closure beat without fresh specificity. Figurative language ("hope's quantum signature," "possibility waves") often substitutes for concrete action. Apply −0.8 for loops and register drift touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and purposeful with strong momentum through the archive discovery sequence. Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character perception, or thematic material. Minor issues: "Legacy's burden, her mother had called it" reads as scaffolding exposition; the phrase "sensitively perceptive hearing" in paragraph two is slightly redundant with surrounding description. Final line "before disappearing back into the green passages that had become the world's new architecture" carries thematic weight but borders on overwriting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with vivid imagery (rainbow fragments, cerulean, indigo depths/coral hope) and good sensory density. Several instances of paraphrase loops and elevated diction muddy momentum: "perceptively calm despite the urgency" is abstract; "borrowed heartbeat" appears four times with minimal variation; "dusky harmony" and "violet shadows held golden promises" border on purple without clear propulsion. The phrase "infinite grace, her fingers trembling only slightly" hedges emotional charge. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph ("with invisible doors opening, with possibilities becoming paths"). These artifacts dull immediacy in peak beats, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Opening and closing images anchor voice and reweight the clipboard effectively. Minor overwriting appears in figurative clusters: "constellation of almost-peace," "broken music," "violence reformed into patience," "grief made infinite" stack metaphors without always sharpening clarity. A few paraphrase loops: "We've mustered here forty-seven times" echoes "For three hundred years, they had failed," and "recognizing names, understanding suddenly" restates within two beats. Stock phrasing ("ancient and patient," "slow art of listening") and one template cadence in the final paragraph ("Not red this time. Not yet gold.") slightly dull propulsion. These artifacts do not obscure causality or closure but prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or theme. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity is strong except for one moment: "The pattern of fissures, viewed from her drone feeds, revealed the migration routes"—the mechanism (how cracks encode flight paths) remains vague and borders on symbolic convenience. Minor figurative density in the final third: "chorus of extinctions," "language only the dead could read," "fractured grace" cluster without clear pattern-teaching, though they don't obscure the closure action. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("silver courtyard," "living anthology," "dialogue between past and present," "constellation patterns," "cada movement a verse") without pattern-teaching or escalation, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "her body a living poem" / "her body now a living anthology"; "writing rebellion" / "bodily poetry finally speaking." Stock metaphors ("scattered diamonds," "breaking bells") and template cadence ("She was," "She had," "She coaxed") accumulate to −0.8 total in Q7. Clarity remains intact, but momentum suffers from ornamental density.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is high and figurative language (meteor hush, cathedral echo, half-lit epiphanies) is purposeful, but paraphrase loops appear: "experiments in narrative ethics, attempts to reverse the damage" and "attempts to make sense of chaos" restate concepts without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the preparation montage: "The story would be... His puppets would be... The story stick would be..." Sentence openings repeat "Marcus" and "His" across adjacent paragraphs, and the reflective register flattens momentum in the final third, preventing the closure beat from gaining propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with high information load per sentence; rhythm modulates between descriptive expansion and tighter action. Minor slips: "interrupted cadence" appears three times as a motif anchor but edges toward over-reliance; "the cloud dwellers would have approved" in the penultimate paragraph is a small tell where implication would be stronger. A few metaphors approach purple ("orange wings like torn sunset") without crossing into muddle. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong, and the closing image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear with good rhythm and sensory density. Opening and closing lines anchor well. However, several scaffold issues appear: "The process illuminated something profound" tells rather than shows the realization. "Different but undiminished" and "technically gentle" feel like template phrasing. The final paragraph accumulates multiple abstractions ("endless braid of preservation," "uncertain future") that soften the closure's concreteness. No major loops, but figurative language occasionally stacks without adding pressure ("like smoke," "ghost-echo").

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance story and atmosphere. However, several template-cadence runs appear ("In four minutes... In seven... In twelve...") and the final third accumulates stacked metaphors that blur rather than sharpen: "illusion wrapped inside a memory disguised as prophecy," "time could fold and unfold like origami," "all foresight is hindsight wearing tomorrow's mask." These figurative densities in peak beats trigger overwriting penalties (−0.5 for density in closure paragraph, −0.3 for mixed vehicle in the origami/mask sequence). The wafer seal kiss and forest-swallowing-footprints images are strong, but adjacent lines carry redundant philosophical restatements. No paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences, but thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph slows momentum before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is generally strong, but several issues accumulate. "Empirically ironic" appears twice as an authorial phrase without grounding in Mara's lexicon. The phrase "devotion to understanding became indistinguishable from the understanding itself" and "dusky harmony" read as imposed concepts rather than earned images. Paraphrase loop in final paragraph: "The covenant required…" followed by "The covenant was sealed" without added pressure. Filter-verb stack: "felt knowledge uncloak," "felt through the floor," "knowing her frugal years." Template cadence in discovery sequence: "The tile wasn't merely…it was a key." Patterned artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high without clear pattern-teaching: "reality bent like water," "rage filled the soundless space like smoke," "heirloom poison," "stranglehold," all cluster without functional pressure differentiation (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "cellular memory" is restated across multiple beats without new detail. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "new seekers, new cellular memories to unlock, new resentments to release" (−0.4). Information density is moderate; many lines do thematic work but not plot work.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance world, character, or atmosphere. Syntax varies purposefully, accelerating during the vision sequence and breathing afterward. Opening and closing lines frame the premise cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. Minor overwriting in the vision beat: "Each droplet of moisture became a tiny lens, and together they projected..." stacks metaphoric vehicles without muddle, but "Stars bloomed in the floorboards. Nebulae swirled in the ceiling beams" risks decorative parallelism that could be compressed. One weak nominalization: "the particular way the glass had fractured" could tighten to "how the glass had fractured." Grammar and tense remain consistent; no pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears in "her weathered hands trembling not from age but from memory" (slight overwriting) and the double explanation of the bag ("forgotten in her haste" then "I packed the wrong bag"). The "deciduous vows—like autumn leaves—were meant to fall" construction is slightly on-the-nose. No loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Information density is high and the final image is clean, but the mild figurative density in the opening and the convenience-reveal keep this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.6)
    Strong figurative density in opening and closing (blossoms as moments, apple as paradox, juice like liquid starlight) creates texture but borders on overwriting—nearly every sentence in the final two paragraphs carries metaphor without breathing room. Template cadence appears in the museum paragraph: "She would return... She would forget... She would appear" (three parallel constructions). Paraphrase loop: "bewildered" appears three times, "inheritance follows no timeline" twice verbatim. Minor clarity issue: "simply complicated" as a repeated phrase feels more like prompt-fulfillment than organic voice. Information density is high, but the accumulation of figurative language in peak beats slightly dulls momentum. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong imagery ("translucent amber that smelled of forgotten gardens," "book bound in condensed starlight"). Minor template cadence in the opening ("had consumed," "had arrived," "had belonged") and occasional filter-verb stacks ("noticed how," "understood she would need"). The trap-room sequence demonstrates good information density. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat, though early exposition is slightly front-loaded.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "moth-eaten and magnificent" characterizes both coat and wearer). Minor overwriting in the middle third: "garden of forgotten names, that neurological phenomenon Marina had been documenting where identities simply ceased to register" is scaffold that could be cut. A few figurative constructions cluster without pattern-teaching ("painted backdrop waves had peeled into tentacles of canvas"), but they remain legible. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Propulsion is steady; the fog-swallowed bay and warm green pulse close with controlled image charge.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs; sentence openings show variety. Information density is high—most lines advance world, character, or stakes. However, the piece carries minor scaffold: "The rope had bound treaties, sealed alliances, and most importantly, marked boundaries" lists without adding pressure; "The first configuration showed... The second configuration revealed... But the third configuration" uses template cadence across three beats. "Warmly methodical precision" in the opening mixes registers (warm emotion + mechanical process). No loops or major clarity breaks, but figurative language occasionally strains ("fables of absence lived" anthropomorphizes without payoff).

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is generally high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully between contemplative longer lines and focused shorter ones during the ritual. However, multiple instances of near-paraphrase loops reduce propulsion: "bloom of hush" is explained three times across paragraphs (rare phenomenon/crystallized silence/sphere of crystallized silence); the beings' "overwhelming" nature is restated without added detail. Template cadence appears in the resolution section: "She stood slowly...She watched as...She tucked..." The final paragraph contains therapy-adjacent phrasing ("gentle luminescence of understanding") that slightly dulls the closure beat. Clarity remains intact but density could tighten by 10-15%.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and often striking ("shard of hush," "anti-light," "shadows that fell upward"), but the piece carries noticeable density issues in its metaphysical beats. Several sentences restate the same cosmic-convergence idea with slight variation ("gravity, pulling events toward this moment" / "threads that only made sense when the weaving was complete" / "conspiracies of light, waiting for someone stubborn enough to connect the stars"). The closing paragraph stacks summary and thematic assertion where a single charged image would suffice. Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("understanding finally," "resonance was built") dull immediacy in key moments, and the template stem "The beacon [verb]" recurs without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with longer contemplative sentences and shorter declarative turns ("We must conjecture"). Information density is moderate; some lines do double work (lightning illuminating topography while charging atmosphere), but reflective passages loop conceptually without advancing situation (paragraph four restates the importance of memory multiple times). Minor paraphrase loop: "the act of cherishing them even as they formed" echoes "preemptively nostalgic for this moment" without added pressure. No major clarity breaks, and figurative language (fog-stone, summer-quill trails of golden light) remains coherent. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm in the chant sequences. "Sulfur and saltpeter, charcoal and stars" establishes pattern. However, several phrases loop: "filtering" appears three times in similar constructions, and "steady as" is repeated in the final paragraph. The closure paragraph stacks abstractions—"purpose," "filtering despair into determination," "serious playfulness," "gravity of hopelessness"—where concrete image would land harder. "Bloom" is used for both moss and the fortress's transformation, diluting the metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; information density is high (most lines advance character, setting, or concept). Minor loop: "transformation" appears as both noun and verb across several beats without functional variation. Stock metaphor: "stars wheeled" and "pooling on wet stone" are competent but familiar. The grotto's "acoustic architecture" phrase reads slightly elevated for the moment's needs. No major scaffold or paraphrase chains; clarity remains high. The piece sustains propulsion through interleaved action (cicada handling, wave intrusion) and reflection without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—compressed action beats ("The porcelain doll cracked") alternate with sensory expansion ("one tasted of pre-dawn stillness, another of the pause between heartbeats"). Information density is high; most lines advance both physical action and thematic resonance. Minor pattern concerns: "xenial sanctuary," "intangibly tangible," and "honey-copper" lean toward decorative precision without strict necessity. The phrase "stretching and dissolving" in "The claustrophobia... stretched and dissolved" performs thematic work but edges toward abstraction. The closing paragraph's "a golden nest where silence grew wild and children of builders learned to fly" risks purple lyricism, though the flight metaphor pays off the bunker/trellis opposition established throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clear with varied rhythm and strong sensory anchoring. However, several passages show overwriting: "vaulting hush here wasn't empty but full—full of all the sounds" uses repetition without adding pressure, and "veils of refracted sound and light" in the penultimate paragraph elevates diction without narrative necessity. Minor scaffold appears in "another soul successfully ferried not just through space, but through understanding"—the parallel construction lands as thesis rather than image. The storm glass descriptions cycle through similar phrasing ("crystalline formations," "fluidly logical precision," "contents dance with perfect equilibrium") across three beats, creating subtle synonym churn. No loops fully obscure causality, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but template cadence and synonym loops appear throughout: "began to sing… song of democracy," "Fragment… fragments… fragment," "knowledge… discoveries… knowledge." Figurative language stacks without always serving clarity: "kaleidoscopic waterfall," "prismatic cascade," "binary sunlight" within one short sequence. The phrase "the future's memory of a past" is conceptually muddled. Stock metaphors ("monument to restraint," "guardian, watching over") dull the closure image. Information density is uneven—paragraph three front-loads archival knowledge (chromium oxide, paint encoding) that could be woven through action. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than trusting the dramatized moment. Sentence openings vary; rhythm is controlled. The scaffold check reveals some exposition ("She knew from the archives") that could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful figurative language ("burnt fingers against the starlight," "noose disguised as an embrace"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "some bridges must burn" recurs across the opening and closing without added pressure; "fading thresholds" and "necessary endings" cycle through adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence emerges in the reflection-heavy middle section with repeated "she'd [past action]" constructions. The closure beat itself remains clear, limiting the deduction under the non-closure cap, but information density sags in the reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose carries visual clarity and some rhythmic variety. However, multiple artifacts accumulate: the opening's "nobody else would—not after the Convergence began" is scaffolding exposition; "quantum promises" and "shadowseam" repeat without functional variation; the convergence paragraph loops concepts ("pressure destroying/pressure creating," "exponential growth"). Template cadence appears: "She touched... She'd kept... She opened... She touched." Filter-verb stack in final third: "watching," "felt," "began collecting." The explain-everything ending summarizes rather than trusts the image. Deductions total approximately −1.4 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm, and the opening/closing frame (first yawn → night's awakening, gramophone → mockingbird) creates satisfying circularity. Minor density issues: "each one carrying fragments of suppressed history" and "pure, unfiltered consciousness pressed into vinyl grooves" lean toward metaphorical decoration without on-page action pressure. "She'd never been happier not to know" in the final line risks thesis articulation but stays character-rooted. One paraphrase loop: "genuinely alone with her thoughts, unable to know" restates the not-knowing motif within two lines without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the transformation beat without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without propulsion. Template cadence emerges in the final third: "Not sunlight—something better. The illumination of..." and "Not into wood...but into something between..." loops the negation-correction structure. Mixed metaphors: "dissolving" armor is "unsnapped from the necessity of its existence"—two incompatible mechanisms in one image. Paraphrase loop: "the trembling moment before choice crystallized" in paragraph ten is restated as "everywhere the greenhouse's influence touched" and "all worlds within himself" in the final paragraph without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, information density is high (each detail advances character or world), and metaphors cohere (dust as language, archaeology of wounds, breadcrumbs for future children). The opening sentence establishes voice and stakes immediately. Minor frictions accumulate: "dust motes unfurl...like tiny spirits" verges on purple; "the broken-hearted learned to speak in artifacts and silence" feels slightly generic; the final two paragraphs contain light paraphrase loops ("wounds required archaeology...witness willing to unfurl the delicate patterns"). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Clarity remains high throughout, and the read-aloud test passes cleanly. The accumulation of small elevations in the ending keeps this from breaking into 8+, but no single artifact harms closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clarity is generally strong, with clean grammar and coherent action sequences. However, the piece suffers from scaffold phrasing and template cadence: "She'd learned that indifference was tyranny's greatest weapon—people forgot what they didn't fight to remember" reads like thesis rather than lived perception. Several beats repeat information without added pressure: the key is described as proof/memory/evidence across multiple paragraphs without functional variation. The ending summarizes major actions ("By dawn, they'd uploaded everything") rather than dramatizing the upload itself, flattening what should be the climactic beat. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job when they could do two.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("mercury finding itself," "blankets of unplayed jazz") is vivid. However, paraphrase loops appear: "dewdrops formed on his brass instrument" / "As dewdrops formed along the saxophone's keys" / "The dewdrops on Marcus's saxophone grew heavy and fell"—three functionally identical beats across the story (−0.2). "Quietly vivid" recurs as a phrase without evolving (−0.2). Some filter stacks ("he saw them gathering," "felt it settle") in reflective passages dull immediacy slightly. Clarity and propulsion are solid; information density is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-taught justification, creating density overload: "bridges of bone," "bell made of starlight," "fractals of emerald joy," "gravity's rebellious children." The final paragraph stacks three restatements of Mira's new role (translator/keeper/decoder) with minimal added pressure. Paraphrase loops appear ("part of her story, part of the regional folklore"; "what was and what might be" echoes "past meets prophecy"). Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph: "She had become... She would teach... The seeds sang... This was..." Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("prodigal trees," "vertical world") undercuts immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies, and opening/closing lines anchor the premise cleanly. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: "He began to improvise. Instead of forcing... Marcus started incorporating..." and "The breakthrough came through... The moment he set it on... But more remarkably..." create a list-like sequence. The phrase "uncertainly certain" recurs without pattern payoff (−0.3). Minor paraphrase loop: "pointing nowhere and everywhere" is restated as "pointing everywhere and nowhere" in the final line. Information density is moderate; some beats (e.g., the three-day repair montage) compress without momentum loss, but the greenhouse discovery beat could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and figurative language (liquid mercury, blood vessels, chrysalis) is mostly coherent and voice-motivated. However, density issues appear: "understanding flooding through her like the rain" is generic; "luminous regret" and "mystical fact" in the final paragraph elevate into abstraction during the closure beat. Minor scaffold: "She laughed, bitter as wormwood" tells emotional state already shown. The kintsugi exposition block in the middle slows momentum but serves the Accumulative design. No major loops or artifacts, but the closing lines lose propulsion to thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer introspective beats ("the harp's broken melody folded into itself until it sounded like weeping made of music") alternating with short urgent beats ("'And fell,' Mara finished gently"). Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Two minor artifacts: "modestly fearless in her practiced steps" (adverb + adjective stack) and the phrase "marriage of sorrow and joy" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward stock metaphor. The tooth as "compass" and the gorge as "cathedral of gold" are vivid but not overworked. Sentence openings vary cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Propulsion remains steady through the confession sequence, though the ease of Thomas's final release slightly deflates momentum before the closing image restores it.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively (short declaratives in crisis beats, longer accumulative sentences during reflection). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic pattern. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "She touched it, and her fingers instantly calculated…"; "She stood, each vertebra announcing…"; "She walked into the forest, her enhanced body mapping…" share identical subject-verb-participial structure across adjacent paragraphs, creating a drumbeat rhythm (−0.5). "The ultraviolet forest called to her enhanced eyes, showing paths visible only in her spectrum of perception" layers two participial phrases without clear necessity. No paraphrase loops or stock metaphors touch the closure beats, so the artifacts remain mid-story momentum drags rather than closure flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful sensory detail (pentimento shadows, mercury-silver, cobalt blue). Information density is high in the discovery beats, with each paint layer revealing new narrative content. However, template cadence and synonym churn appear in reflective passages: "elusively tangible sense," "eternal instant," "suspended market," "eternal commerce" recur as thematic markers without varied embodiment. The phrase "eternal instant" appears twice without functional pressure difference, and "between-worlds translator" is repeated across beats as a label rather than dramatized through distinct actions. These patterns reduce propulsion in non-action beats and trigger −0.6 for template cadence and stock metaphor strings, plus minor filter-verb stacking ("seemed to fade," "thought of") that dulls immediacy in one high-density paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high across most beats ("dust motes spiral," "hollow core," "yellow as old teeth"). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several scaffold constructions slow momentum: "He had learned to be skillfully observant" tells rather than shows; "Marcus had come here to discover what ceilings hide, following a trail…" is expository summary of off-page action; "Understanding flooded through him" is a filter-verb stack that abstracts the revelation. The phrase "he would sit with the ghosts a little longer, learning their names" in the penultimate paragraph loops back to recap rather than advancing. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull propulsion in a high-pressure sequence, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening third (filing system, frost patterns, Great Softening). Clarity is mostly strong, though some metaphors stack without grounding: "eternity folded into itself like origami made of time" is vivid but abstract. Minor scaffold appears: "She knew she should file it properly" followed immediately by restating the system's purpose. The phrase "rustling awakenings" recurs without cumulative charge. No major loops or template cadence. Propulsion is steady but the final paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize the peak action ("working quickly," "continued pressing").

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice effectively, but several patterns recur: "She had spent twenty years…," "The shard pulsed…," "Together, she and the Venusians…" template similar syntactic stems. The penultimate paragraph stacks abstract phrases ("burnished bright," "lens through which she could finally see clearly") where concrete image would sharpen closure. Figurative language is dense—"frozen tears," "rivers of light," "liquid history"—without always doing double work; "impossible colors" and "ghosts within recognized a kindred spirit" blur into ornament. No major loops or causality breaks, but momentum sags in the final third under metaphoric overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive with strong imagery (rust spreading, chip pulsing, boxes opening "like a flower"). Minor template cadence in the exposition paragraph ("Since that cursed hour... iron rusted...") and slight paraphrase loop between "stuck inside" and "refused to play" in paragraph three. The phrase "tinker's wonder made manifest" in the penultimate paragraph lands as thematic label rather than image, and "wings of a simple repairman's song" in the final line tilts slightly purple. Density is high, but figurative language clusters without always earning its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong imagery ("limestone walls grew thin," "folded into the limestone like pressed flowers"). However, several instances of paraphrase-loop and scaffold appear: "She could follow them, she realized" immediately precedes a restatement of the same realization, and "The Hartley expedition hadn't vanished—they had simply walked through" is then reiterated conceptually in the next line. Overwriting in the vision sequence: "understanding that bypassed thought entirely" and "explanations were never meant to encompass such vastness" are abstract where concrete image would serve better. The final paragraph loops between surface return and the vial's significance without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with short beats during the sculpture's emergence and longer reflective spans around the magic lantern. However, the piece carries visible scaffold: "These weren't ghosts but something more profound—timewoven alliances" directly restates the core concept, and the final two paragraphs loop through near-synonyms of transformation ("reimagined by the storm, shaped like her own driftwood"). Stock metaphors appear without fresh grounding—"time folded like origami," "history's expanse"—and several sentences open with "The" or "Marina" in mechanical alternation. Information density is high in sensory passages but thins during thematic summary. The closure paragraph stacks abstract claims rather than landing a concrete final image, dulling propulsion at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but paraphrase loops and template cadence reduce momentum. "Dawning hush" appears three times in near-identical phrasing; "certain beauties refuse the sun's scrutiny/refuse the sun" cycles within two paragraphs. Figurative density is high throughout ("blooms into vast murals that seemed to breathe," "flowers that opened only in darkness, petals that caught moonlight like memories") without clear escalation or payoff, triggering overwriting friction. Several beats restate the same content: Mara paints at night because daylight "would have been wrong" is echoed by "nocturnal blooms," "activate in darkness," and "bloomed at night because…harsh edges softened." Aggregate pattern-artifact penalty and loop deductions apply.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong imagery (obsidian lagoon, infinity of floating libraries). However, several lines loop conceptually: "truth and tension were not opposites but partners" restates the earlier "truth creates tension" without added pressure. Phrases like "temporal vertigo," "searing weight," and "complex beauty of struggle" stack abstract modifiers in peak beats, reducing specificity. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "The message took shape... The diary... The obsidian lagoon..." No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and purposeful with varied sentence openings and rhythms. Information density is high: the opening line establishes object, character skill, and central paradox. Minor loop: "false comfort/false comforts" appears twice in close proximity (paragraph 4 and implicit echo in paragraph 5). Template cadence in paragraph 6: "He saw the fishermen...The merchants...The lovers..." lists without syntactic variation. The line "Through pure force of will and alchemical training, he began to conceive a method no other had attempted" tells rather than shows the conception work. No major artifacts touch closure, but accumulation of these patterns prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence rhythm and strong imagery ("sound like breaking teeth," "sky that hadn't been blue in his lifetime"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Two friction points: paragraph three includes a paraphrase loop—"voices were mathematics carved in wax" closely echoes "sound was just patterns"—and the phrase "the emotional patterns within them" recurs across paragraphs without functional variation. The final paragraph stacks multiple summary gestures ("his work finally complete," "transcended time," "knowledge that transcended time") that lean toward tell rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentences open diversely and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing image, action, or concept. However, minor paraphrase loops appear: "waiting" recurs across "waiting for the precise stellar alignment," "oak panels…waiting," and "waiting to be reopened"; "furiously tranquil" appears twice in identical phrasing at open and close without reweighting. The metaphor "velvet worn smooth in some places and bristling in others" for borrowed time is vivid, but "wild serenity" and "furiously tranquil" function as abstract inversions rather than concrete embodiment. No major scaffold or template cadence mars clarity, and propulsion remains steady through the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    Syntax varies and information density is generally high, but several loops and scaffold phrases appear: "windblown sanctuary" recurs four times without functional shift; "She preferred listening over noise" is told and then paraphrased in "tracking storms the old way"; "zero hour had arrived" is announced rather than shown through accumulating pressure. The phrase "acrylic seal gleaming" and "ice crystals that chimed like a thousand tiny bells" are decorative metaphors that slow momentum at the denouement. Template cadence in the middle section: "The usual winds… had stilled," "The barometric data suggested," "The cathedral bell rope caught…" use parallel passive/past-perfect stems across adjacent lines. Apply −0.8 for distributed loops and scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose has strong rhythmic moments ("Each observation was an act of faith, each measurement a meditation") and vivid sensory detail (yellow lantern glass humming, frequencies felt rather than heard). However, pervasive overwriting flattens momentum: nearly every paragraph contains elevated metaphor ("atoms that had traveled billions of years only to burn brilliantly," "whisper of light that the yellow lantern glass captured and held"). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("not emptiness, but fullness" / "not an ending but a transformation"). Template cadence runs through several beats with parallel structures that become predictable. Several stock metaphors (stars as pilgrims, vulnerability as telescope, stillness as garden) accumulate without sufficient grounding in action. The closure beat itself is touched by abstraction ("the strength to simply be") rather than concrete image, triggering the higher artifact penalty range.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and clear propulsion. However, several ornamental constructions slow momentum: "Their movements traced patterns she recognized—the old inspection routes, the careful choreography of tending living hives" paraphrases the same idea across the dash. The phrase "tranquilly perceptive" and "mute eloquence" lean purple in context. Some metaphoric density in the final third ("buzzed like phantom bees in colored light," "luminous weight...heavy and luminous as honey") stacks figurative language without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in "To protect the bees. To sustain the community. To preserve the oasis."

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates adequately. However, the middle third loops conceptually: "She'd anticipated these mysteries" → "Each description revealed another piece" → "The borrowed-time timekeepers would become living bridges"—three consecutive paragraphs restating Voss's plan without advancing present pressure (paraphrase-loop deduction −0.4). The garage-sale ad gimmick (embedding warnings in item descriptions) strains credibility and reads as quirky ornament. Final paragraph over-explains theme, dulling the closure image. Figurative language ("beacon," "egg," "lighthouse") is functional but not dense enough to trigger overwriting penalties. Clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Clarity and momentum are strong, though several lines carry mild overwriting: "each barbule a thread waiting to be woven into dawn" stacks metaphor without adding pressure; "that burnished hush that follows storms" leans decorative. The phrase "her weathered notebook balanced on one knee" and "warmly attentive eyes" feel slightly stock. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; information density is good. The final paragraph's "Morning is not the absence of night, but the tender mending of darkness" reads as thesis statement rather than image-driven closure. Minor figurative density in a reflective piece, but no artifact that obscures causality or dulls the closure image beyond the Thematic Echo already scored in Q5. Proofreading clean; grammar solid.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with lines doing double work (e.g., "The diagnosis had arrived like salt spray on a windless day" anchors both terminal illness and island setting). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in the final section: "monument to the possibility of interspecies respect, built not by humans but by the slow collaboration of wood and stone, mediated by those wise enough to die into translation" stacks abstractions where a single concrete image would carry more force. The phrase "brazen calm" itself feels slightly writerly-precious when repeated without embodied dramatization of that contradictory state.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are adequately diverse, but several passages exhibit template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Elena studied… Elena understood… Elena touched" stems cluster in the final third. "The chemistry of homecoming" appears three times with minimal variation. "Bronze quiet" recurs purposefully but "luminous" is overused (skepticism, something luminous and terrible). Minor filter-verb stack in mid-section ("She thought… her instruments could barely detect"). Figurative language ("sing to something pre-rational," "ancient moisture") is dense but mostly coherent. Clarity and momentum are intact, though tightening would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"twilight bled," "liquid fertilizer," "choir of the extinct," "calcium embrace"—without pattern-teaching or pressure variance, triggering overwriting penalty. Mixed metaphor: "garden would eat the battlefield whole" personifies the garden as predator while seeds are passive agents, muddling vehicle logic. Template cadence surfaces in the penultimate paragraph: "Within a season... Within a year... Within a decade" is rhythmically purposeful but mechanically parallel. Paraphrase loop: "speak new life into being" (graf 9) restates "whisper Etruscan growth-songs" (graf 6) without added pressure. No severe loops, but density and occasional register drift lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high: "tower-stacks of crushed automobiles," "retrofitted shipping container wedged between two mountains of scrap" do double work as setting and character history. One paraphrase loop: "The leaf contains coordinates" / "each vein became a route" restates the same mechanic across two beats without added pressure. Figurative density is controlled except in the phonograph scene, where "meaning pressed directly into her mind," "color-tinted revelations," and "microscopic etchings" cluster without a taught pattern. No copy errors or unclear action sequences; clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and auditory texture. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or theme without padding. Minor scaffold: "After the shutdown, when the experimental drives had torn reality into ribbons, the station's thousand souls had scattered" compresses backstory efficiently, but "the echoed silence deepened as she worked" repeats the title phrase without adding new pressure. A few figurative constructions ("temporally stretched, their moments pulled thin like taffy") are vivid but cluster in exposition rather than peak beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line clarity is strong; no loops or paraphrase chains detected. Rhythm varies naturally. Information density is high in the swap sequence. However, the opening paragraph stacks three figurative constructs in quick succession (frozen needle, trapped starlight, impossible geometries) without pattern-teaching, approaching overwriting. The phrase "cautious abandon" recurs as anchor but borders on oxymoron decorativeness. No scaffold or template cadence. Propulsion steady; no momentum sag.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, figurative language appears densely without always advancing pressure: "breathless pause," "ghosts of legislation," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence" cluster in ways that occasionally obscure rather than propel. "Tell them I'm busy unbinding the small truths from the large lies" borders on thematic echo. Paraphrase near the end: the penultimate paragraph restates Marina's stance in slightly varied terms without new pressure. Template stems appear ("she who had pulled," "she'd learned," "she thought") but do not form runs. Net effect: −0.6 for density without consistent payoff, −0.2 for mild loop in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or story. Some overwriting in figurative language: "the weight of ten thousand witnessed futures crushed her ability to recall," "hidden thunder rolled," and stacked metaphors around mercury/silver. A few near-paraphrases ("she'd been a gardener… had known soil and seed, had coaxed life") and template stems ("she moved… she found… she pressed"). No major loops or scaffold, but density of metaphor in peak beats slightly dulls propulsion. Clarity remains intact; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and largely coherent (raindrops as glass beads, platinum pieces reflecting futures, tapestry revealing intentions), but some constructions feel overwrought: "fierce repose," "woven hush descended like fog made of whispers," "the breath between one moment and the next." Line-level clarity is generally strong, though a few phrases approach purple ("the lull of distant thunder that never arrived" recurs without adding pressure). Minor scaffold: "Three years had passed since the tournament" is efficient setup, but the subsequent backstory explanation could be more concise. No major loops or template cadence issues. Information density is good; most lines advance character or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance image, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images bookend the transformation cleanly. However, several lines loop conceptually: "believing that echoes merely repeated, when in fact they refracted, split, and transformed" is immediately paraphrased by "The canyon caught it, twisted it, sent it spiraling up." The phrase "her work complete before the ritual could begin" summarizes what the prior paragraph already dramatized. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she understood," "she heard") in a few beats dulls immediacy slightly, and "Each poem refracted...becoming a hundred different truths simultaneously" repeats the core refraction idea without adding pressure. Still, the prose is largely clear and propulsive with no major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varies appropriately; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high in the middle (golden threads, kintsugi, quilted memories) but paragraph structure occasionally stalls momentum with reflective paraphrase loops: "Every crack becomes a river of gold...Every scar a testament to survival" restates without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats ("spider across," "testament to survival," "river of gold") without fresh transformation. Minor template cadence in the narration sequence ("In the beginning...Then came the breaking...But breaking is not ending") reads purposeful but borders on mechanical. No major clarity breaks, but density could tighten by removing near-duplicates.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and information density is high in the cave sequence. Clarity and momentum are strong through the discovery. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "temporary eternities" / "infinite and fleeting" / "brief forever" cycle across paragraphs without added nuance, and "Each shell…" structures repeat. "Permanent in its impermanence" in the final section is a stock paradox that dulls the closure beat slightly. The opening's "spider-webbing" is vivid, but "carried the secret…like a shell holds the sound of the sea" is a mixed metaphor (shells don't literally hold sound). Apply −0.6 for loops and metaphor muddle touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is generally strong. However, figurative density clusters in high-pressure beats without clear payoff: "vibrations of intent so pure they could manifest memory into molecules," "screaming tenderness, that particular ache of loving someone you cannot touch," "gentle violence of refusing to let go." Mixed metaphor in "screaming tenderness" (oxymoron serving theme) versus "gentle violence" (near-synonym churn). The phrase "beckon across dimensions" appears twice (once as infinitive, once as verb). Final paragraph over-explains closure with abstraction rather than landing on image. Minor paraphrase loop: "Come back to me" / "Come back...to be saved."

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. Information density is generally high (most sentences advance character or situation). Paraphrase loop detected: "The reverse migration wasn't voluntary" followed immediately by restating the same concept with "something in their blood responded to the dying earth's pull" (−0.2). Template cadence in the phone-call sequence: "Seven degrees...Wait for dawn" / "Avoid the eastern bridge" / "Little one, listen" uses repetitive instructional stems across multiple beats without taught pattern (−0.4). Stock metaphor "stitched together from loss and duty" in the final paragraph (−0.2). Cumulatively −0.8 in Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive: "trees swaying like hanged men," "earth and copper and something older." Information density is high; most lines advance character or world. Minor loop: "The truth compulsion had shattered most relationships...Communities dissolved into bitter honesty, marriages crumbled" paraphrases the same idea across two sentences. The opening's "glass eye rolled between Mara's fingers" and closing's "blind glass eye clicked against the remaining truffles like dice" frame well. Sentence variety mostly strong, though a few filter verbs ("she could see") could sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across the piece. Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "rice becoming sea foam" advances memory and setting). The phrase "softly persistent" recurs three times, risking decorative repetition, but each use reweights (boutonniere's silence, genetics, rising tide), so it reads as intentional pattern rather than loop. One near-paraphrase appears: "The gaps weren't missing pieces—they were the only parts left intact" echoes the earlier "gaps where memories should bloom," though the second instance clarifies rather than merely restates. Figurative language is dense in the opening and closing thirds but stays coherent and voice-motivated. No scaffold or synonym churn detected. Minor lift if the "softly persistent" motif were pruned to two touches.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid—"memory, not light but memory. A promise, decades old, suddenly sharp as broken glass." Sentence structure supports momentum through the rising action. Deductions: the phrase "that peculiar gift" in paragraph one is a scaffold appositive that repeats the concept just named; "The lonely map dealer" epithet in the penultimate paragraph interrupts flow; and "everything identical except for one crucial thing: he was no longer someone who only sold maps. He was someone who followed them" is a paraphrase loop across adjacent sentences (−0.4 cumulative).

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or pressure. However, several phrases trend toward stock lyricism: "silk drawn across broken glass," "lacy menace," "crystalline, sharp." The metaphor "bruised heart" for the glowing stone is vivid but borders on decorative. The final paragraph's "her softly commanding presence now just another light" recycles the opening phrase without adding pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs, but figurative density in the climax slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clean with varied syntax and no grammar errors, but several patterns accumulate: "density of presence/experience," "weight of being/moment," "exact/exactly" (three uses), and template stems ("Her grandmother had been," "What if presence isn't," "The nautilus shell began to"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "palette of resolve" as a phrase feels forced into the closure without prior setup. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "not captured but invited, not compressed but understood" restates the same pivot. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, others linger in description without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance theme, character, or the temporal puzzle. Rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the final beats where short sentences accelerate: "If she was going to soar, she might as well begin by falling." Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "She'd written it after—before?—chronicling the dream" and "The boundaries had been negotiable even then" restate temporal confusion without adding pressure. Template cadence ("The Maya who'd soared," "The Maya who'd swum," "The Maya who'd spoken") clusters mid-story but serves thematic parallelism rather than artifact. Minor figurative muddle: "feral nostalgia clawed at her chest—not longing for a specific past, but for the very concept of linear time" mixes metaphors (feral/clawed with abstract concept) without full coherence. No major line-level opacity; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high (water singing through copper versus brass, rust growing in patterns that mirror sorrow), and the prose integrates action with atmosphere effectively. Template cadence appears in the reflection-heavy middle section: "She had learned that repair work was really translation work," "This was what reading between lines meant," "She thought about her lost sense"—three consecutive explanatory frames that slow momentum. The metaphor "water breaking free" functions cleanly, but "trembling calm" as repeated modifier lacks concrete embodiment in peak beats. No loops or scaffolding obscure causality, and the final image charges prior material without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies effectively—short bursts during breath-holding, longer sentences during memory. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Two minor artifacts: "Her lungs screamed. The platform tilted. Master Yuen remained perfectly still, watching" uses abrupt fragments for effect but the final fragment ("watching") adds no new pressure. "The budding rune scholar had bloomed" is a conventional metaphor that deflates the prior tactile closure. No paraphrase loops; clarity remains intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, opening with archive atmosphere then tightening during the requiem scene. Information density is high; most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears in "She'd written about it triumphantly" which recaps rather than advances, and "The hush before destruction was over" feels slightly formulaic. The metaphor "damage became a door" skirts purple but stays voice-appropriate for a columnist. No paraphrase loops. Figurative language cluster in final paragraph ("story slant," "sometimes" anaphora) fits lyric closure mode under accumulative accent. Proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (möbius strip, nautilus spiral, helix) serves theme without overwhelming clarity. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "wanderingly exact precision" echoed by "wanderingly exact path," and the concept of unified opposites restated across multiple paragraphs without new detail. Template cadence in the middle third ("She had witnessed... She had perhaps... She began...") flattens momentum. The closing image is clean, but the phrase "resounding hush" recurs four times, three as identical construction, reducing specificity. Minor filter-verb stacks ("began transforming," "started dissolving") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and cadence, −0.3 for filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory specificity and rhythmic control, especially in the countdown sequence that interleaves memory and present action. Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or philosophical layering. However, minor redundancy appears: "Each drop fell the same distance, took the same duration, created the same soft echo" restates constancy already established, and the penultimate paragraph summarizes insights ("Clocks measured the distance between moments") already shown through ritual and key. The final paragraph loops thematically ("the razor edge") without adding pressure. Template cadence is avoided, but the piece edges toward overwriting in peak reflective beats without forwarding new stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong imagery: "rivulets trace equations," "mica pane split the candlelight into rainbows." Information density is high in the first half. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "They were breadcrumbs left by the city's underground mathematics society, people who understood that numbers could be both truth and deception simultaneously" restates the concept already established. The final paragraph stacks summary: "understanding finally that...," "The mathematics of contradiction had no proofs, only practice," and "everything lucid and contradictory" recycle the same idea. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "She'd assumed...but now understood," "her father's heart had stuttered and failed...her own had broken." These artifacts dull the closure image slightly, triggering a deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; no template cadence runs. Information density is high ("the subway's third rail sang its loneliest frequency"). Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated without overwriting. Minor paraphrase: "tell me about the dream" / "she always had dreams worth sharing" adds texture rather than looping. No syntax monotony, pronoun confusion, or filter-verb stacks. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final line attempts resonance through image. Zero scaffold or generation artifacts visible.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is strong in the opening (walnut-ink stains, wisteria cascade, boats bobbing) and the codicil beat, where syntax tightens and information density peaks. However, several passages loop conceptually: "weight of small moments" is named three times, "gently thorough" recurs without functional variation, and the closing paragraph paraphrases earlier material ("haunted euphoria," "gentle thoroughness of remembering everything"). The phrase "For seventeen years, she had been gently thorough" front-loads backstory in a way that reads more like scaffold than character-specific recall. The final two paragraphs contain multiple abstract thematic restatements that dilute the image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Strong lines: "that particular absence of Earth that made lunar samples unmistakable," "green cathedral of abandoned intentions." No loops or scaffolding detected. Minor deduction: "desperately jocular edge she'd perfected in Mozambique after the cyclone" front-loads backstory in a way that slightly dilutes present momentum, and "Everything worthwhile is technically illegal" skirts stock aphorism territory, though the voice modulates it.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing: "It wasn't a place but a presence" and "not through space but through the vast territories" repeat the not-X-but-Y template. Figurative language clusters heavily ("warm honey," "quiet blaze," "soul's architecture") without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity in high-pressure beats. The ending paragraph stacks summary assertions ("changed," "would never leave," "would pulse") that tell rather than show the transformation, flattening propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and purposeful with varied sentence openings and strong information density. The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several stock phrases appear: "crystallizing as she spoke," "anchoring her to her own timeline," "pulsed once, as if in approval." The phrase "strange comfort" recurs but feels asserted rather than enacted through specific sensory or emotional texture. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs four and five both explain the anomaly's editing function with overlapping language ("edited"/"revising"). No major artifacts touch the closure beat, and the final image (pen drifting in twisted starlight) is concrete and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong images ("spilled mercury," "space where sound should exist but didn't"). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports the accumulative build. Two issues: "joyful sorrow" is repeated as a phrase rather than embodied through contradictory action (−0.3); the backstory paragraph is somewhat scaffold-heavy with summary compression ("she'd spent decades attempting") rather than scene density (−0.2). No major loops or artifact patterns. Information density is moderate—some beats do double work, others lean decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs weaken propulsion: "The lending library arsonist had been... Mira Volkov wasn't proud... but each fire had been..." uses stacked past-perfects in adjacent sentences; "all depicted the same woman, all deliberately damaged" is synonym churn. "Volcanic tenderness" appears three times without evolving meaning. The final paragraph recycles "volcanic tenderness" and "promise" in a summary-like rhythm rather than concrete image. Stock metaphors ("dormant seeds," "lava cooling") and filter-verb stacks ("had been," "had understood," "had been leading") dull immediacy. Proofreading is clean, but information density sags under retrospective exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (acoustic flowers, auric lagoon, auroral sorrow) creates texture. However, several phrases loop or synonym-churn: "the confluence where consciousness pooled" followed by "wisps of thought and feeling"; "wasn't trying to save memories but harvest them, distilling human experience into data streams" restates in adjacent clauses. Template cadence appears in the climax paragraph: "The entangled memories … began generating … manifesting … creating." Mixed metaphor: "perch on the boundary" works spatially, but "vantage" in the next sentence blurs whether she's perched or standing. Clarity holds, and the final image ("drumming new rhythms") is strong, keeping this in mid-band despite minor artifact debt.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the piece carries noticeable template cadence: repeated "he'd [past perfect]" scaffolding in paragraphs 3–4, and several lines paraphrase prior content (e.g., "The zodiac coin grew warm" echoes the earlier warmth claim without new pressure). The closing paragraph stacks three metaphors (whispered prayer, aurora light, wisdom traveling) that blur rather than sharpen the final image. Paragraph-cut test: the grandfather-coin backstory in paragraph two does not alter present stakes and could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "spiralingly calm movements—like water circling a drain in reverse," "secrets cast shadows darker than any night," "his work complete." Multiple beats restate the theme with synonym churn: "darkness wasn't empty but full," "grief was like closing every window," "stillwater tension…began to ease." Template cadence in the final paragraph ("Tomorrow would bring…and she would be waiting…") stacks declarative conclusions. No paraphrase loops touch closure directly, but overwriting dulls momentum across the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing images frame the piece, but several patterns accumulate: "forests of second thoughts" appears three times, "amplified quiet" twice, creating synonym-loop effects. Figurative language clusters heavily in summary beats ("magnetic grotto under starlight," "mist swirling tighter as if trying to hide them") without always serving immediate pressure. The phrase "hearing her unspoken words as clearly as if she'd shouted them" followed by immediate italicized thought creates redundancy. The climactic paragraph summarizes citizen reactions in list form rather than dramatizing one vivid moment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("The dock worker moved like water itself" versus the shorter beats during the whale-call sequence). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or thematic pressure. Two minor loops: "The scrimshaw seemed to pulse with warmth" / "The scrimshaw grew hot in her palm" repeats the warming motif without added pressure; "detach from their false selves" / "detach from our constructed selves" is near-paraphrase within a few paragraphs. Figurative language (sublittoral fringe, bioluminescent beaches) remains coherent and advances atmosphere. No major scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; the performer's staccato announcements ("Now I select the knife") alternate with longer descriptive passages. Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, world, or theme. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Slight overwriting in the opening: "empty as winter sky," "flat as pressed paper," "eternal whisper-roar" stack metaphor within three sentences. The figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, so no artifact penalty applies, but tighter compression would sharpen the entry.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm and sentence variety support the lyric mode, and many lines do double work (image + character state). However, paraphrase loops appear: the final paragraph restates the transformation thesis in three overlapping formulations ("not destroying but transforming, not conquering but conversing"; "not of destruction, but of revealing"). Template cadence runs through the middle ("This was cloud-shadow poetry... It started in his chest... The frozen lake began..."). Filter-verb stacks ("felt it building," "felt") and stock metaphors ("living calligraphy," "body became ink") accumulate across high-pressure beats. The Text Artifact Screen applies: −0.8 for loops and template stems that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor the frame. Information density is high in the flower-language passages. Minor scaffold: "She had seen him working late, trying to incorporate sound into his glass sculptures, failing each time" and "Being colorblind had taught her to find beauty where others saw only damage, imperfection where others demanded wholeness" restate ideas present elsewhere. The phoenix description and "awakening" recur with thematic intent but border on over-reliance. No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and purposeful sensory detail. No major loops or template cadence runs. However, the final paragraph accumulates slight scaffolding: "But differently. Always differently" is a beat that restates rather than advances, and "perfectly imperfect note" lands as a tidy paradox rather than sharp image. Figurative density is high throughout (golden shadows, dust motes, shimmer) but mostly clear. The cost-proof issue in Q2 traces partly to line-level abstraction here: "something real has begun" and "gentle renovation" describe rather than show the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, paragraph breaks create visual breath. Some stock constructions appear: "dark circles beneath her eyes," "voice barely above a whisper," "the expression still feeling foreign on her face" echo genre template. "Curtains of intention" and "subdued ardor" read as elevated vocabulary chosen for thematic weight but risk register drift from the otherwise grounded jeweler's idiom. Two paraphrase loops: "tomorrow, perhaps, she'd have the courage" immediately follows "she couldn't bring herself to commit. Not yet." Information density is generally high, but the final paragraph recaps rather than advances ("Her subdued ardor for life was returning" tells what the scene has already shown). No major scaffold or syntax monotony; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful imagery: "coiled beside them like a sleeping snake," "tiny prisms," "flowing river of light and shadow." However, several lines loop or restate: "inherited mystery" appears twice in similar framing, and "mapping tomorrow's migrations through yesterday's ruins" recycles the core metaphor without new pressure. Template cadence in "She produced another card" / "She produced a final card" and filter-verb reliance ("Vera had moved," "Marcus leaned") slightly dull immediacy in mid-beats. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several prose artifacts reduce propulsion: paraphrase loops ("not her tears, but those of someone centuries dead, yet she felt..."), stock metaphors ("hurt to perceive directly," "sang too fiercely to be sorrow"), and template cadence in the tier-climbing sequence. The final paragraph stacks filter verbs and abstraction ("pursued the forbidden knowledge not to possess it but to ensure it possessed no one") where a concrete image would land harder. Overwriting is prevalent in high-pressure beats: "dancing—no, convulsing—no, transforming in movements that defied description" tells rather than shows the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops degrade momentum: "shadow in the recordings moved independently" / "shadow had been migrating"; "dreams become shareable" / "dreams became shareable"; "softly deliberate" recurs three times without functional variation. Figurative density is high throughout—"glass petals," "dark aurora," "translucent figure," "prismatic light"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating a decorative haze in peak beats. The phrase "the shape of hope" and "luminous regret" are abstract where concrete image would sharpen. Template cadence is present but does not dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("Stars wheeled overhead" versus the clipped surgery beats). Information density is high: most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor deductions: "rolled between the redwoods while stars pierced through gaps" slightly over-writes the opening; "facades falling away too" is a touch on-the-nose for the shedding-layers method. The paraphrase loop in "She could have reported it, could have let it pass" (-0.2) and the final paragraph's "knowing exactly who she was" edge toward diagnostic summary. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (frosted hourglass, meteor hush, vegetable grief) without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is thick (hourglass, meteor hush, tree rings, coffee rings, seed metaphor) but coherent and pattern-taught early; the density serves the accumulative lens rather than obscuring it. Minor register drift: "pathological," "collagen," "ambient, democratic" lean clinical/abstract but remain plausible for a scar-obsessed POV. Zero scaffold or synonym churn. The final line ("smaller doors") charges prior material cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: "brittle celluloid holding frames of a movie nobody remembered," "velvet seats like closed mouths." Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Two issues prevent higher scoring: a paraphrase loop in the middle ("The building itself began to reveal its secret—it was an incubator… The projection booth had absorbed it all") and light overwriting in the climactic beats where nearly every sentence carries metaphor without breathing room, risking density fatigue. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are controlled. A handful of template stems appear: "The aurora…" opens two adjacent beats, "She could…" recurs, and "The astrolabe…" repeats within close proximity. Two paraphrase loops: "hear them again—the unspoken words" in paragraph one is restated as "heard what Lyra heard—the symphony of unspoken stellar thoughts" in paragraph three; "remembered stardust" recurs four times without reweighting. The closure beat—"creativity… poured back into the world like a river of stars"—mixes metaphors (pouring liquid/river of solids) and leans on stock cosmic imagery, reducing precision at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is imagistically dense with purposeful rhythm variation ("petals occasionally everywhere and nowhere at once," "electric blue, singing petals"). Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resonance effectively. However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops: "quantum flowers that existed in multiple places simultaneously, petals occasionally everywhere and nowhere at once" restates the same idea; "divergent archives, those scattered repositories where humanity's memories had fled" is immediate gloss. Template cadence appears in the pirate encounter ("his form flickering," "his voice echoing," "his fingers phase-shifting"). Figurative density is high but occasionally muddles clarity ("probability fog," "quantum foam," "probability clouds" cluster without distinct function). Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is mostly coherent ("bark on a wandering tree," "wild frontier of unlimited possibility"). Information density is high in the opening third. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops in the final third: "wild frontier" appears three times in escalating abstractions, and "probable miracles" is both stated and restated. The closing paragraph stacks three versions of the same promise ("adding new gears," "unravel the careful knots," "explore the infinite wilderness"), reducing propulsion at the closure beat. Template cadence is minimal but present in the reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is steady; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense: "limestone teeth," "water whispered names," "courage sleeps in its unused corners." In the peak confession beat and closure, metaphor density approaches saturation without pattern-teaching payoff ("star-shaped spaces where light could finally enter" stacks with "leaking through her ticket" within two lines). High information density overall, but the closure image relies on repeated star/light/space imagery that blurs into symbolic convenience rather than sharpening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several passages loop conceptually: "some silences were unpardonable" in paragraph one is restated as "unpardonable silence" in paragraph four and "the cost of safety in silence" in paragraph five—synonym churn without escalation. "Seraphically mundane" and "transmuted into something else" elevate diction beyond Marcus's blue-collar bellhop idiom. The final paragraph stacks metaphors ("frostbitten hope," "regenerating nerves singing with something that felt almost like music") in a single beat, muddying clarity. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, so the deduction remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clarity and concision are strong in most beats; sentence variety supports rhythm. However, mild template cadence appears in the message catalog ("Each cryptic note," "Over the next constellation pause," "Days later—or decades") and the opening sequence recycles similar stems ("her ancient frame," "her simple robes," "her bloodline"). The pellet's mechanics at closure—"releasing ink that spread like living shadow, writing truth across the floor"—leans purple and abstract, dulling the climactic image. Minor filter stacking ("She felt the walls tremble") and one paraphrase loop (messages described twice in adjacent paragraphs) lower the score within band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong propulsion through most beats with varied sentence openings and rhythmic control. Information density is high: the atlas page, diary, tapping, and coral observations do double duty. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The coral below had been white for so long" / "The bleaching hadn't been death but metamorphosis" restates the same idea without added pressure. "Shifted states, moved between forms like water becoming ice becoming vapor" is a stock metaphor that dilutes specificity. Template cadence in "She moved through the station, tapping on every surface, building a symphony of rhythms. Each tone revealed more" slightly flattens momentum. No artifacts touch closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sensory detail is precise ("amber threads," "brass-rimmed lenses"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 6–7 restate "the hum intensified" and "stones pulsed," and the penultimate paragraph recycles "the lull was ending / next movement beginning" across sentences. Template cadence in the final two paragraphs ("The stones hummed…," "The stars above seemed…," "Kira smiled…") flattens propulsion. Deduct −0.8 for loops and stem repetition touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is generally high; most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "They remembered everything—every footstep, every dropped object, every word" cycles synonym churn, and "returning choice to human evolution" near closure is scaffolded by the prior line's genetic-pattern explanation. Template cadence emerges in the insurgent-arrival paragraph ("former teachers, engineers, farmers—all drawn..."). The kite-decoding beat summarizes key causality ("The plants helped her decode it") rather than dramatizing the translation process, costing propulsion. Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt it spreading," "feeling the volcanic heat") cluster in the climax. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; "silk scarves in wind" and "honey in summer heat" are apt. Accumulated artifacts and one paraphrase loop trigger −0.6 in Q7, with an additional −0.2 for summary-of-key-beat, landing mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. The white orchids/phosphorus/sheets compression is exemplary propulsion. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the lighthouse motif with cost. Minor density slip: "This quiet talent had emerged after the bombing" could be shown through her pruning rather than told, though the embodied follow-up (plants curve toward light) partially recovers. One filter-verb stack in the reflection on Dr. Mansour's teaching, but it does not dull a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("reality folding like badly mixed watercolors," "shadows…multiplied, fractured, split") but appears in nearly every sentence, creating texture saturation that dulls propulsion at closure. Paraphrase loops are present: "wasn't closing in, they were opening inward" / "wasn't damaged; it was showing all its possible states" employ template-cadence parallelism without added pressure. Rhetorical question stems repeat across beats ("What good…?", "How can I…?", "Why do we…?", "What if…?", "Who says…?") without variation. Information density is moderate; many lines describe symbolic states rather than advancing Marina's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and momentum are adequate; sentences advance atmosphere and concept. However, several scaffolding artifacts appear: "consciously wild methodology," "purposeful effect," "serene anger that had driven her" are recycled label phrases. The opening of paragraph three ("The eclipse had triggered it again") and paragraph six ("Her equipment, salvaged and modified") use template framing. Minor paraphrase loop: "disappearing backward through time, rewinding into nothingness" restates the same content. The final paragraph contains thematic summary ("a truth about human perception that had been hiding in plain sight") that tells rather than shows. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "dangerous memories" / "contraband truths" / "volatile for living eyes" restate the same idea across paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the middle section—"The letter had arrived...The liaison letter trembled...The echoing library...Now, bravely conflicted"—where successive paragraphs open with similar declarative stems. Figurative language is frequent and mostly effective ("branching like ice crystals," "thaw like spring rivers"), though "dizzying quiet" in the final line and "the terrible peace of someone who'd finally chosen their history" veer toward stock formulations. Clarity and propulsion remain strong, and no filter-verb stacks or pronoun ambiguities appear. Minor scaffold and synonym churn touch non-closure beats but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is strong with varied rhythm and high information density. Opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor artifacts: "Patience," "Resilience," and "engraved quiet" function as thematic labels rather than dramatized pressure; the phrase "teaching them to weave continuity through chaos" is a paraphrase loop (restating her method without adding detail). "Understanding flooding through her with that peculiar perception" and "saw something shift in his expression" are filter-verb stacks that summarize rather than show. Template cadence in the reflection block ("not for targets or threats, but for the spaces between violence") and near-synonym churn ("bounty hunting," "architects of destruction," "antidote") add scaffold. Apply −0.6 for these artifacts clustered in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in many beats: "A child's laugh became silver vines. A widow's sob crystallized into blue thorns" conveys both world rule and atmosphere efficiently. Opening and closing images anchor voice and reconfigure prior motifs effectively. However, multiple lines rely on similar structures: "A constellation tumbled lower... Where starlight touched sound wave, new hybrid blooms erupted"; "The rail spike sang... Then she felt it: a tug..."; "What followed was not a struggle but a dance." Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without always adding new information—"prowling cat made of departed music," "phosphorescent rain," "frequencies that shouldn't exist"—creating decorative density rather than propulsion. Some metaphoric vehicles stretch logic: constellations casting "shadows that sang" when they are themselves light sources. Stock phrases ("her heart hammered rhythms," "tested. Each pass") dilute specificity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the cumulative effect of ornamental phrasing in peak moments applies a moderate deduction here.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies effectively ("That was when she understood" paragraph break creates emphasis). Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. However, several figurative constructions in close proximity risk overwriting: "copper dome floating... like a ship unmoored," "orbits of regret," "chasing the contradiction like a comet's tail," and "clouds... glow like old newsprint held to flame" all appear within the first two-thirds. Two paraphrase loops: the "truth moved like planets" metaphor is explained twice in adjacent sentences, and "Some orbits... Some regrets..." near the end repeats the same conceptual point. The phrase "devotedly observant nature" in paragraph three reads as template characterization. No major clarity breaks, but density dips slightly in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is high; no ambiguous pronouns or spatial confusion. However, multiple sentences loop conceptually: "deleted and overwritten, their binary souls compressed" versus "Each update had murdered its predecessor, and the guilt had accumulated"—both convey the same information within two paragraphs. Figurative density is high throughout ("amber pendant with trapped mosquito," "pages in a closing book," "sediment," "meteor hush," "three-dimensional mandala," "lullaby for machines") without pattern-teaching or escalation—the same lyric register in low-stakes setup and peak translating work. Template stems recur: "She began to work…Her needles moved…She was translating…When she finished…" Minor: "meteor hush" appears three times as a stock phrase without evolving meaning each instance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm, but several patterns accumulate: "she'd" constructions recur heavily in the opening third, and metaphoric density is high throughout ("milk through water," "dandelions into wind," "lilac fog," "watercolor rivers") without all vehicles earning their keep under pressure. The phrase "emergent hush" appears multiple times as both concept and descriptor, creating mild redundancy. Information density is good—most lines advance atmosphere or understanding—but some exposition ("Her art had always been about making the invisible visible") summarizes rather than showing through present action. No major loops or causality breaks, but the accumulation of minor textural choices keeps the score from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high and most lines advance multiple elements. Rhythm varies appropriately with emotional beats. However, several lines exhibit ornamental intensification: "strange, cold warmth" and "warm coldness of necessary change" repeat the same oxymoronic register without adding pressure. "Retrocognitively trapped but finally free" is a conceptual loop stating the paradox twice. The phrase "something deeper than guilt" is vague scaffolding. The opening and closing images are strong, but mid-story phrasing occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence during high-pressure moments without pattern-teaching ("despair's purple edge," "fishing lines cast into temporal streams," "stones across water"), creating textural saturation. Paraphrase loops appear: "The fractured timeline responded" followed immediately by "Suddenly, the amphitheater hosted every performance." The final paragraph stacks poetic constructions ("Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. Rising like nostalgia itself") that slow propulsion at closure. These issues accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 range in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing multiple jobs (the geode both refracts light and represents the recalled pills). However, several beats loop: "creating bridges between neural pathways" and "illuminate hidden pathways" and "pathways to understanding" recycle the same core image across three separate moments without escalation. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels: "Maya's willowglass hope had proven stronger than rigid certainty" restates what we've already seen. Filter-verb density in the middle section ("began to devise," "had begun to devise," "started to coalesce") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high without padding. Minor issues: "The fossil served as her transitional object—a bridge between the tangible world and the heat-signatures" restates the concept in adjacent clauses without added pressure (−0.2 for paraphrase loop). "It simply was, and it had been waiting" leans slightly abstract. Template cadence appears once ("It wasn't hostile or benign—such categories meant nothing to it. It simply was...") but does not pervade. Figurative language ("the caves exhaled") is controlled and purposeful. No line-level artifacts obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dense figurative language without pattern-teaching: "time moved sideways," "pulverized dreams," "pure potential," "infinite garden" cluster without coherent vehicle. Paraphrase loops appear ("not forward or backward, but sideways" / "unscramble themselves from chaos"; "wasn't preserving the past; she was spinning futures" / "keep them flowing, preventing them from solidifying"). Template cadence in the final paragraph: "one lost button, one turned hourglass, one captured echo at a time." Elevated diction ("concentrated into a single moment of pure potential") clashes with concrete warehouse setting. Applying overwriting density penalty (−0.5), paraphrase-loop penalty (−0.2), and template-cadence penalty (−0.5); total −1.2, plus additional clarity reduction from mixed metaphors (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sentences generally advance story without padding. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, several text artifacts diminish precision: "prudently daring in her approach" is a forced attribute insertion; "vouchsafed her extraction papers" uses an archaic register that clashes with operational urgency; "the tilt of the earth toward spring" repeats verbatim as bookend without evolution. Paraphrase loop: "watching him disappear into the mist, then began her own descent" / "The snow-codes were already melting" recaps rather than advances. Minor filter-verb stack in the exposition middle ("He reached...pulled out...set") doesn't obscure but dulls immediacy. No major loops or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies well, and information density is high (needle, fog, promises, distillation cohere without clutter). However, mild scaffold appears: "closely attentive" recurs as a phrase marker, and "understanding percolate through ambient awareness" in the opening leans abstract without immediate grounding action. The metaphor of fog-as-thread is sustained coherently. No major loops, but the ending's "lifting dark" and "newly visible" stars border on stock imagery. Propulsion is steady, though a few lines ("Each night...," "Tonight, the rain gutters...") use template openings.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character memory, or world logic. "The glass thrummed against her spine" and "pale green like memory, cracked like the world itself" demonstrate vivid specificity. However, craft metaphors recur heavily: "patient as fired clay," "like glaze settling on bisqueware," "precise as throwing porcelain." While voice-consistent, the pattern risks mechanical template cadence across high-pressure beats. The phrase "or perhaps tomorrow" and "or was it four?" are purposeful disorientation cues that pay off, but the figurative density in paragraph eight ("flooding through her like glaze settling") slightly muddies momentum. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the gauge's function is restated across paragraphs ("measuring precise depths," "measuring the distance," "every gauge eventually finds its proper depth"), and reflective blocks recycle the same conceptual claim ("cycles must end," "transitions," "season of rest and renewal") without adding pressure. These loops cluster in the reflective middle third, dulling momentum slightly. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though "quivering hush" and "luminous" recur without evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong sensory anchors (clouds beneath glass, brass warming, stone circle glowing). However, figurative language clusters densely in reflective passages without clear payoff: "cracked her open like an egg," "brittle of transformation—the moment before ice becomes water, before coal becomes diamond," and "atomically reflective" repeated without mechanical grounding. The final paragraph stacks metaphors (measuring time in space between lost and found, weight of memory and lightness of becoming) that blur rather than sharpen the image. Minimal loops or scaffold, but elevated diction in peak beats ("anachronisms," "contemporary with extinction itself") drifts from the POV's embodied voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the phrase "prismatic quiet" appears twice (paragraph 6 and 13), and several figurative constructions cluster without necessity: "architecture of longing," "grammar of desire," "wisdom wearing dancing shoes." The final paragraph stacks three metaphorical restatements of the theme (keeper of secrets, mirror doubling, inevitability) that blur rather than sharpen the closure image. No loops or scaffold sentence stems, but the density of ornamentation in the ending slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and momentum are solid; no major loops. Information density is adequate: most lines advance plot or atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: "The charts revealed… It had learned… As evening approached… Through her headphones…" echoes formulaic scene-building. Stock metaphors proliferate without fresh specificity: "metallic sentinels," "war of frequencies," "grinding, metallic shriek." The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("invisible guardian," "analog defiance," "patterns of resistance") that dilute the closure image. Paraphrase loop: "outwit cosmic trickster" → "outwitted the cosmic trickster" across two paragraphs. No filter-verb stacks or major artifact clusters that obscure causality, keeping this mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is mostly clean with vivid images ("geometric wound in the earth," "stars wheeled in their eternal dance"). Information density is high and figurative language is controlled. However, minor loops appear: "compass point" recurs formulaically, "the cartographers had..." constructions repeat, and the final paragraph includes paraphrase ("The claustrophobic explorer had descended; something altogether more paradoxical had returned" restates the transformation already shown). Template cadence in some passages ("He walked forward... He pocketed both compasses... Marcus emerged") slightly flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "victim number one... victim two... by the eleventh portrait... the final portrait" creates a mechanical progression. Paraphrase loops near the end: "the fractures that make us human, the contradictions that complete us" restates "we are all divided selves seeking dangerous unity" without added pressure. The figurative language in the closure paragraph ("holding truth like cupped hands holding water") is coherent but borders on purple at a beat that should tighten. No loops obscure causality, so deductions remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though some scaffolding persists: "She inserted the nail...and the holographic projection shifted" uses flat sequencing where syntax could heighten discovery. The phrase "spongey dread that had been building in her chest since dawn now pressed against her ribs like wet wool" stacks two metaphors (spongey, wet wool) without clear integration. "The reformed jet stream was birthing another monster" recycles the earlier "birthed category-seven hurricanes." Several exposition blocks ("The nail had been her only inheritance...") pause momentum. The final paragraph's "understanding finally why Lydia's bravery had been overlooked" tells what should emerge through image.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose clarity is generally high, but figurative density in peak beats creates muddle: "seed that bloomed into luminous disbelief," "bridges forming and dissolving in the amber air," "reality developing like a photograph in reverse" stack metaphors without clear physical anchors. Paraphrase loops appear: "Each pixelated fragment...corresponded to a choice" / "Each fragment held a moment of supposed failure" restates across paragraphs. Template cadence in the montage ("There—the seventeen-year-old...There—the woman...There—the daughter") reads mechanical. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood," "she knew") cluster in the understanding sequence without voice motivation. No clarity break at closure, but artifacts pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and sentences carry vivid specificity ("rusted into the hillside like a wound healing over"). Information density is generally high. However, the final two paragraphs loop conceptually: "the greatest robbery," "every highway leads home," "every innovation recreates the past," "best way to dissuade travelers from a dangerous path was to show them they were already walking it"—four restatements of the same insight without added pressure. Template cadence appears: "Sometimes Chen visited… understanding now that… adding it to the wall where…" stacks exposition. The penultimate beat summarizes rather than dramatizes: "TerraLoop dissolved two weeks later, Chen citing…" The closure image is vivid but preceded by explicit thematic summary that dulls its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high in the discovery beats (telegram, star pulse, temple prediction). However, "understanding dawned slowly, like sunrise on an airless moon" is a stock metaphor, and "burden" recurs five times without reweighting. "Midnight solace" appears twice in the final third, the second instance ("midnight solace of revelation") reading like thematic echo. Minor paraphrase loop: "shared burden" and "burden was heavy, but shared" restate without added pressure. These artifacts dull momentum but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is grammatically clean and mostly propulsive. Information density is high in the opening paragraph (illusion failed, frozen confession, seven sunsets). However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "His ancestor hadn't betrayed the druids at all—he'd accepted a terrible burden, pretending to plant the flesh-eating seeds while actually sowing their dormant cousins, harmless until activated by a specific incantation. It was a deception within a deception, designed to fool an enemy..." recounts the discovery in expository summary rather than dramatizing Kael's realization. The final paragraph stacks multiple summary sentences ("His ancestor had found the one thing that could save them and lost everything else to protect it. Now Kael would plant it...") that restate theme rather than advancing action. Minor scaffold: "understanding now" and "he understood" appear twice. Figurative language is controlled (mirror/glass/vortex motifs) without mixed metaphors, but the closing aphorism "truth, like water, always found its way" borders on stock.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Figurative density is high throughout ("sapphires," "electricity through water," "cat's cradle made of light") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, approaching −0.4 territory but not crossing into full muddle. Paraphrase appears: "Everyone had forgotten the covenant...That was its nature—to be hidden" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor "fruit from impossible trees" and "starlight" at closure are minor slips. Information density is uneven; middle paragraphs loop conceptually around scars/covenant without advancing pressure. No grammar or continuity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but overwriting clusters in multiple beats: "that fiercely gentle touch that defined her, protective and soft simultaneously" restates the same idea; "her reckless belief that destiny itself could be negotiated with love" in the penultimate paragraph summarizes theme rather than advancing; "half-lit corridors" appears twice. Mixed metaphor: destinies as "threads" and "paths" toggle without integration. Template cadence in the Elena memory paragraph: "Elena, who'd drawn…laughing…kissing…" stacks modifiers in a way that flattens propulsion. The figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching, and some images (light flooding, cathedral of bone) are vivid but conventional. Deduction: −0.8 for density and minor loops; −0.4 for scaffold in the reflection block.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies purposefully with longer reflective passages and shorter decisive beats. However, two paraphrase loops appear: paragraph two's "the kind of detritus that ended up in his hands" echoes the prior exile summary without adding pressure; paragraph nine's "actual music, actual crowds, actual nights" reads as emphasis churn. The "amplifier parts from an estate sale" / "dead people's dreams" construction stacks metaphorical weight. Propulsion occasionally stalls in mid-story reflection before recovering for the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is mostly maintained, but several artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loop: "haunted by ambitions" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence: "She'd been haunted…," "She'd always maintained…," "She felt…," "She saw…" across multiple beats. The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("consciousness seeks consciousness across any distance, through any medium, transcending time itself") that read as thesis rather than image. Filter-verb reliance ("she felt," "she understood," "she recognized") in peak beats dulls immediacy. Deductions total approximately −1.2 in Q7 for loops, cadence, and summary in the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm and no major loops. However, "migrating," "fluctuates," "becoming," and "transformations" recur as thematic vocabulary without escalation. "The tidal atrium breathed with the ocean's rhythm" in the opening is echoed by "her mechanical heart beating in time with the tides" at closure—a charged reprise, but the metaphor doesn't tighten. "The wintersun cast long shadows through the atrium, each one a different story, each one true" is figuratively dense without advancing the beat. Minor template cadence in the final two paragraphs: "This was her gift...This was enough...This was enough."

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences weaken momentum: "She thought of her mother... She thought of Marcus" is a mechanical stem repetition, and the pearl's transformation is restated multiple times ("transform his isolation into something luminous," "transform accumulated isolation into concentrated light"). The phrase "abandoned hope" appears three times across the piece without significant reweighting. Stock metaphors ("walls dissolve like salt in warm water," "veins of hope") in peak beats reduce specificity. The inspection-report framing is clever but the "Unsuitable for emergency habitation—structural integrity compromised by excessive luminosity" line reads more clever than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong figurative work: "guilt had worked into his bones," "layers of graffiti layered the walls like sediment." Two friction points lower the score: paraphrase loop between "The river knows what the bridge denies" and the later explanation of what it means; and template cadence in the final paragraph with repeated "he'd" constructions across adjacent lines. The final paragraph also contains mild overwriting: "raw solace" and the extended river-current explanation could compress. Information density is high elsewhere, and no artifacts touch the closure image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is mostly clean with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops: "The cipher had fully unfolded, revealing that she had always been both" immediately followed by "she understood...that her documentation would become part of the library itself" restates revelation without advancing pressure. The phrase "cautious exuberance" appears twice as a label without embodied demonstration. Figurative density—"mist coiled," "trapped constellations," "consciousness folding through time like origami," "ink rising from deep water"—accumulates in every paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff, trending toward overwriting (−0.5 within Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear but carries template artifacts: "the weight of old money and older secrets," "built on graves that refused to stay silent," and "some dreams...were worth infinitely more when released than when grasped" are stock literary phrases. The opening sentence's stacked metaphor (velvet drapes absorb sound "like a confession booth" while matching twilight) strains coherence. Paraphrase loop: the final paragraph repeats the "promise that hadn't lost its glow" from the opening note, then explains the metaphor rather than trusting the image. Information density is high in the middle section but the ending over-explains ("ensuring the ice-singers would never be forgotten again"). No major loops or grammatical errors; syntax varies adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loop at "preserve not just beauty, not just death, but the moment between them" then "radiant hush between the last heartbeat and the first silence" restates the same concept without added pressure (−0.4). Stock metaphor "tide of glass" and "cathedral of frozen aurora" are vivid but not fresh. Several filter-verb stacks ("began to infuse," "began to sing," "felt it pulling") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The final paragraph over-explains the closure image that the prior scene had already dramatized, adding scaffold rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates rhythmic control and vivid imagery: "morning mist clung...like silk," "shadows pooled...dark and patient." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor pattern artifacts appear: "The grotto extended...The grotto held...The pattern had always been there" shows mild subject-stem repetition, and "kindly decisive/kindly decisiveness" recurs across paragraphs. The opening and closing lines bracket effectively (mist at threshold / cycle turning on), and figurative language mostly serves purpose. One small clarity slip: "scallop outward in concentric rings" mixes geometric metaphors (scallop suggests waves, rings are circular). No loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well ("Rich men always dress their guilt in designer uncertainty"), but several runs suffer from template cadence: "I opened my case… I began burning… I moved toward." The "cloak of doubt" appears three times without functional variation, trending toward motif-token. Mixed metaphor: "wrapped in expensive doubt" versus "cloak of doubt" versus "performed vulnerability"—the metaphor vehicles shift without clear pattern. No paraphrase loops, and the final paragraph propels cleanly, but mid-story scaffold ("The wind chimes shifted to a minor key") adds minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops recur: "The trance descended...trance began to lift," "weaving truth carefully...woven truth finally ready," "backwards aging...aging in reverse." Template cadence runs appear: "She had been withholding...would withhold...had been preparing to say since the day she would die" across three consecutive sentences without taught pattern (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("leaves on still air," "rings carrying data") dull clarity. Information density is moderate but momentum flags during exposition blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings differ; paragraph lengths create visual breaks. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or temporal logic. Minor scaffold present: "She had come here as a young woman" and "She had learned to appraise" are slight exposition anchors that could be tighter, and "The skill had taken lifetimes to develop" summarizes rather than dramatizes progression, costing momentum. One paraphrase loop: "The old texts spoke of stone skimmers who could slide across water" and "But none had written of navigating through time" restate her pioneering nature across adjacent beats. No metaphor muddle, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, no template cadence runs. Clarity remains high; grammar and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("clouds rolled beneath her like a sea of ghosts") serves atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. However, mild paraphrase loops appear in the final third: "she had found the most powerful magic of all. She had found the sacred in the simple" restates the same insight across adjacent lines. Template cadence runs ("She laughed... She was still... She couldn't... But she could") cluster in the garden sequence, flattening momentum. Opening and closing images are strong, but the middle beats carry scaffolding phrases ("this was the brilliant dimness," "this was magic that accommodated") that read as exposition rather than discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear with varied sentence rhythm and vivid figurative language ("meteor hush that pressed against her eardrums," "words signified not meaning but existence itself"). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "hiding behind truth" appears three times, "wandering purposefully" twice, and "luminous vows" recurs without reweighting. The journal passage shifts into expository mode ("a society of sensory wanderers") that stalls momentum. Minor filter-verb stacks in the middle third ("She moved," "She'd taken," "She understood") flatten immediacy. No major artifacts touch closure but density dips in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "understanding flooding backward from a future moment of clarity" echoes "know her purpose only after fulfilling it" without added pressure. The phrase "each one necessary" in paragraph five restates "every cast... creates micro-expansions... each one a seed of hope" from paragraph eight. Figurative language is dense ("insects in resin," "tuning fork," "breathing universe") but remains legible. Minor template cadence in "she saw/would see/had seen" construction, though pattern-taught. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of near-synonyms ("distill," "distilled," "distillation") and elevated diction in reflective beats drag momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing double work. However, several passages show decorative layering that slows momentum: "This was the gift hidden in the old reaper's recordings—the knowledge that unnamed fears grew monstrous in darkness, but withered when given proper words" restates what the naming scene already demonstrated. The phrase "echoed through the observatory's dome, joining the chorus of forgotten phrases" is a paraphrase loop (echoes/chorus/phrases). Minor template cadence in the sea-paragraph structure. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clarity and momentum are solid; the ritual sequence propels forward without major loops. However, several template stems recur: "She'd spent," "She'd practiced," "She'd need to," creating mild cadence monotony in the setup. Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "flickering like a candle in wind," "slipped sideways into somewhere else." The climax relies on generic intensifiers ("began to shimmer," "flickered in and out") rather than concrete sensory escalation. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the penalty in the modest range.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with strong images: "ancient teeth," "black mirrors reflecting nothing but silence," "memory pooled like standing water." Information density is high; most lines advance story and atmosphere. Two pattern issues reduce the score: paraphrase loops in the exposition block ("The story the town commissioners had worked to expunge... The precisely humane lie they'd told") and template cadence in the photographic sequence ("Click. His grandmother... Click. Elena had taught... Click."). The "mirrored hush" recurs three times, twice decoratively. Filter-verb stack in one passage ("recognized," "reviewed," "retrieved") slightly dulls immediacy during a key discovery beat, though not egregiously.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language saturates multiple beats without clear pattern-teaching: "kaleidoscopic curtain," "cursive mathematics," "breathing geometry," "aerial mathematics," "punctuation marks in an endless poem." Mixed metaphor appears: starlings as both cursive script and punctuation. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 6: "the touch of wonder" and "balance the weight of knowledge with the lightness of awe" restate the same idea. Template stems recur: "This was why…," "This was what…," "She would carry…," "Before the final transformation…" Minimal scaffold loops, but density of metaphor in high-pressure beats (sublimation, starlings) risks obscuring propulsion. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well and information density is high in most beats. Several strong images ("trees that grew upside-down," "chemical signals that traveled along fungal networks spanning miles of sky"). However, the piece carries noticeable template cadence in the opening section: "After the radio static clears, she would have...The corporation that employed her demanded...Each night at midnight, she climbed..." The stem pattern "Her hands/fingers" recurs across multiple paragraphs. "The watcher's burden of knowing that her reports determined" reads slightly abstract for peak pressure. One paraphrase near closure: the "burden had become her purpose" restates the "not just watching anymore" shift. Minor scaffold present but doesn't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. Minor loops appear: "feel…feel…felt" in paragraph three, "memory of what emotion should feel like" echoes "remembers terror" from two lines prior. "Neither can feel because both are incomplete" states what the scene should embody. The sparring sequence is kinetically clear and propels, but the ending paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("understanding flooding," "architecture where feeling could live," "potential for it") that soften closure impact. No major artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose carries lyric ambition with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax, but several artifacts accumulate. Template cadence appears in the tunnel-effect paragraph: "Each blower's drone...," "Marcus began to sing...," "The wind from the blowers...." Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity: "weight...pressing against his chest like a stone," "darkness that felt lighter," "joy...never truly dies." The hourglass metaphor in "As the final grain slipped through" introduces time-tracking logic absent elsewhere. Paraphrase loops appear: "laughter leaves echoes, and echoes can be recalled" restates the premise already shown, and the closing paragraph recycles "mournfully eager" from the opening without adding pressure. Information density is high in the central performance sequence but dilutes in framing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high: "She crouched now among the ice-glazed topiaries, watching mist roll across dead grass that crunched like broken glass beneath her bare feet" does scenic, sensory, and character work simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: "The pendant showed her these edges, taught her to wait in the spaces between" edges toward abstraction without concrete image. One unnecessary scaffold: "Not a question" after dialogue already conveys certainty. Overall propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm variation, but several artifacts accumulate: "the penny dropping after decades of accumulated knowledge suddenly clicking into place" is a paraphrase loop within one sentence; "scarred hands" appears twice; "The Nexus roared" + "feeling its warmth spread through his bones" stacks sensation without advancing causal detail. The figurative density ("destruction was just creation wearing a different mask") occasionally substitutes for concrete dramatization of the transformation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent. However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "endings became beginnings" / "every ending was already writing its next beginning"; "the shape of its absence" elaborates "couldn't be captured" without advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks thematic restatements ("to teach others to find beginnings in their endings by discarding the assumption that silence meant absence") that feel like scaffolding. Sentence openings vary, but density dips in reflective passages. No major grammatical errors; spatial choreography is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and creates atmosphere: "Each night, the *Meridian Passage* materialized at precisely 11:47, when clocks run sideways and time folds into itself." Figurative language is purposeful in early beats. However, the convergence sequence stacks abstractions without concrete action anchors: "experiencing every version of his story at once," "pure possibility into the night," "eternal *Meridian Passage*." Paraphrase loop in the final paragraph: "no longer ardent for escape" / "found his purpose in the perpetual journey" restates the same idea. Template cadence in the woman-passenger beat: "She clutched… her edges flickering… her reflection… showed three different faces" uses parallel construction without progression. Minor −0.6 for loops and abstraction density in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is high and sentences advance description consistently. However, paraphrase loops appear ("realistically imaginary" recurs three times without evolving meaning; "As memories alter" bookends with identical phrasing). Figurative density in most sentences—"sinew of consciousness," "fault lines," "breathing walls"—does not teach a pattern or modulate with pressure. Stock metaphor strings ("rough like doubt, smooth like certainty") and template cadence ("She pulled… She wove… She paused…") accumulate across the middle third. No line-level artifact obscures the closure beat, but density without variation dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clean and legible with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty (e.g., chain link description conveys both object and alien philosophy). Template cadence appears in the middle section: "They learned to read...to interpret...The chain link served..." runs of parallel infinitives without variation. Minor synonym churn: "somber marvel" recurs without reweighting. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle: "pressurized transit tube" into "bioluminescent pearls" into "crushing darkness"—the pearl metaphor clashes with industrial realism. No loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, pairing long atmospheric builds ("The mist curled through the glass atrium like breath through broken teeth") with short declarative beats ("She ran"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, two minor loops appear: "she'd been an audiologist, persistently curious" is followed immediately by "why some patients heard things others couldn't, when she'd discovered," creating a brief paraphrase stutter. The final paragraph's "refusing to let vulnerable voices disappear into the reeling hush of forgetting" stacks near-synonyms ("disappear," "forgetting," "hush") in a way that dilutes clarity at a high-stakes beat. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks, and the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Propulsion is strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm modulation. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Minor loop: "Remember us. Remember what we found" followed two paragraphs later by "she would remember" creates paraphrase adjacency. Figurative language occasionally clusters without escalation—"amber preservative," "digital cancer," "neural pathways," "throat swallowing"—though most metaphors remain apt and don't obscure causality. Sentence openings vary well and clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings avoid runs. Information density is high in the ink-pattern sequence and monitor description. Minor loops: "One hundred twelve, one hundred thirteen. His heartbeat always accelerated when he began the process" closely echoes the prior pattern without added pressure (paraphrase-loop −0.2). "Show me" followed by "The screens began to defragment" reads clean. The final paragraph's "counted his heartbeats and watched his ghost self coalesce" recharges earlier material effectively. Clarity and concision strong overall; no scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid specifics ("organ pipes," "frozen scream," "copper-laced fingernails"). Some redundancy: "echoes" appears repeatedly without reweighting, and the phrase "quietly articulate" is used twice in similar contexts. The final paragraph stacks clauses in a way that feels slightly overwrought ("the starlings returned each evening, their patterns writing stories in the air that only the canyon could read, preserving languages that had not yet been born"). No major loops, but density could tighten in the closing summary.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and clarity is mostly strong, but several abstract phrases recur without deepening pressure: "frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed," "cosmic joke," "metamorphosis." The phrase "the cosmic joke was simple: suffering could become transcendence if you were brave enough to laugh along" is a near-explicit theme statement in the penultimate paragraph, flattening the closure image that follows. Minor filter-verb stacks appear ("Marina felt," "she understood"), and some metaphors blur under scrutiny ("sensation like laughter made physical"). Information density is adequate, but the final third leans on summary rather than scene-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well in action beats ("The first statue faltered. Its head tilted..."). Strong verbs anchor key moments: "shattered," "groaned," "writhed." However, paraphrase loops appear: "began to remember" / "beginning to sing again"; "clockwork hearts" repeated across adjacent paragraphs without added detail. Template cadence in the climax: "She played the shell's hollow architecture, its abandoned perfection, its proof..." stacks three parallel possessives without variation. Figurative density escalates in final paragraphs—"fire in her strings," "gap between knowing and understanding," "played herself empty"—blurring clarity at the closure beat. The metaphor "playing the gap" in the final line feels abstract rather than concrete. Minor filter-verb stack: "began to remember," "began to crack," "began to sing" within three paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (each paragraph advances world, character, or atmosphere). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, the phrase "cobalt cathedral of broken promises" exemplifies slight overwriting—figurative density that risks self-consciousness in a high-pressure beat. The final paragraph's "linking absences that mattered most—the spaces between heartbreak and hope" summarizes rather than trusts the image, reducing propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high (fragment embedded in wood, angel's missing piece). Minor overwriting clusters: "memories refusing to settle," "understanding dawning like sunrise through fog," "light spread like water, not harsh but whispering." These phrases in the garden sequence blur into decorative accumulation rather than propulsion. Paraphrase check passes; no template cadence. Propulsion slows slightly in the oasis description but recovers at the singing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and the prose carries momentum through most beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "searching" recurs without advancing knowledge, and the final paragraph's wine/books/architecture list feels stacked. The closure paragraph contains template cadence ("waiting... for the next revelation to unfold") and near-summary of theme that flattens propulsion. Figurative language (shelves breathing, scarf as portal) is vivid but occasionally dense without pattern-teaching in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images anchor effectively. Information density is high: the palette description, the cover-story photography, the grandmother's deathbed gift all do multiple jobs. Minor loop: "whispers grew stronger…not in volume but in clarity" is echoed by "the islands' whispers seemed softer" without new pressure; "luminous absence" and "luminous in their absence" repeat the key phrase in adjacent lines of the final paragraph. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the closing moralizing edges toward scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but several patterns reduce momentum. The opening sentence stacks three dependent clauses before reaching its subject; "enveloped secrets nested like matryoshka dolls" is a mixed metaphor (envelopes don't nest). Paraphrase loops appear: "fear had become the jailer, and fear required no key" immediately restates the same idea. Stock metaphors recur without fresh inflection: "supernova compressed into a whisper," "seed was planted, the door opened." Template cadence is visible in the climactic paragraph: "Each fear she touched rang out... Some futures collapsed... others grew stronger." Figurative density in high-pressure beats ("sharp edges of collective doubt," "fiber optic cable carrying light") obscures concrete action. Penalty totals: paraphrase −0.4, template stems −0.5, figurative muddle −0.6, with artifacts touching the closure beat = −1.5 cumulative in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong imagery ("memories floating like jellyfish," "amber shadows"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "chronically curious, even as a child collecting folklore" is immediately restated as "decades of studying folklore had taught Margaret to detect patterns." The phrase "broken constellations" recurs without added charge. The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("The greenhouse shuddered… her mind heavy… walked back… ready to guide… she would teach… stories now") that feel like scaffold rather than scene. Filter-verb clusters ("she found it," "she could see them," "she understood now") dull immediacy in the climactic beat. Information density is high elsewhere, but the closure sequence loses momentum to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and dense with information. Strong images: "rust on iron," "sharp-edged with fresh grief," "geometry that would unlock a mother's return." Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Minor loop: "The forgotten library existed between worlds" paragraph front-loads exposition that could be woven through action. The phrase "peculiar hush as an empty playground swing drifts" is evocative but slightly strained—hushs don't drift. One filter-verb cluster in the opening beats ("watching how," "see where") softens immediacy. No major artifacts touch the closure, and information density is high throughout the annotation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid imagery ("light from the other world spilled like honey," "opened like an eye, like a door, like a memory"), but several patterns reduce density. The phrase "insatiably creative" appears twice in identical form, and synonym loops emerge around "essence/possibility of magic/wonder." Multiple sentences begin with "The" or "She" in succession, creating template cadence in the middle section. The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("her life's greatest work complete," "the very possibility of magic itself") that tell rather than show the closure's significance. No major opacity or causality breaks, but the prose carries scaffolding that could be tightened—"This was how she would succor the dying magic: by capturing the essence" front-loads explanation where action might suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm, but several patterns accumulate. "Coiled like a sleeping serpent," "a sound like distant thunder swallowed by fog," "like jellyfish made of starlight"—the simile density clusters without always advancing pressure. "The interlaced hush—the weaving together of silence and sound, absence and presence" paraphrases its own concept. "Dissolved into the work" and "time folded" are stock phrases. Template openings appear: "The sanctuary's prisms..." recurs mechanically. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in mid-beats, warranting deduction in the −0.8 range for non-closure accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high. The opening effectively anchors voice and stakes. However, several passages show template-cadence patterns and near-paraphrase loops: "She understood now why she had been drawn here" followed immediately by restating the henge's nature; "the same angle, the same vault, the same frescoes" is echoed by "those same gestures" two paragraphs later. Filter-verb stacks appear in the video-comparison sequence ("she could see it clearly," "She understood now"). Minor clarity issues don't touch closure but accumulate to −0.6 in this category under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance multiple layers (character, atmosphere, theme). Figurative language is controlled and apt: "darkness thick as centuries," "spines like tombstones," "membrane between stories." Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, moderate overwriting appears in the final third: "the sophisticated melancholy of understanding that preservation and release are the same motion viewed from different angles" and "each tiny book a world, each world a gentle argument against forgetting" stack metaphors without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces briefly: "She broke the surface... the sky the color... the ocean accepting..." uses parallel "the [noun]" constructions across three beats. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly in peak beats, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("inverted sea," "blooming data"). However, mild overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: "cascading symbols that morphed from binary to botanical, numbers blooming into abstract flowers" stacks metaphors without advancing action. A paraphrase loop near the end: "digital and ancient, lonely and hopeful" echoes prior phrasing. Stock phrase "ghost in the machine" diluted to "ghost in the code" without fresh inflection. Information density is high overall, but figurative load in peak moments slightly dulls propulsion (−0.3 to −0.5 range per overwriting check).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; the floor-by-floor structure creates natural beat markers without mechanical repetition. Information density is high: most lines advance discovery, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Two craft slips lower the score: (1) "Ninth floor. Ice crystals danced...each one catching light like suspended grief" stacks metaphor density without deepening pressure in that beat; (2) the penultimate paragraph summarizes theme ("sorrow needn't freeze us solid. Sometimes it simply teaches us...") where image would have been stronger. Grammar and tense are clean; no loops or scaffolding detected. Propulsion holds through the climb but softens slightly in the final two paragraphs with reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high—most sentences advance observation, world-building, or thematic layering. However, "spooled wholeness" appears twice without added meaning, and "empty spaces remember" / "gave their memories back" borders on paraphrase loop across paragraphs seven and ten. Minor template cadence in exposition beats ("She'd documented dozens," "She thought of Marcus") slightly dulls momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Rhythm varies, though several paragraphs open with subject-verb structures in sequence ("She ran," "She'd already discovered," "She began to craft"). Two paraphrase loops: paragraph four restates "coin revealed...true purpose" across multiple lines, and paragraph eight recaps "her condition wasn't a limitation" after the realization was dramatized in paragraph six (−0.4). Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle: "cathedral of knowledge" clashes with "hollow trunk" in physicality. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. The final line "carrying the sky inside her own walls" lands cleanly without scaffold. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; minor redundancy prevents higher placement.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Information density is generally high, with most lines advancing observation or pattern recognition. However, the final two paragraphs contain paraphrase loops: "she had found her purpose: to chart not the next great discovery, but the rediscovery of what we had lost" repeats the same concept in adjacent clauses, and "The starlings spiraled upward, writing ephemeral stories in the sky, and Elara followed, translating their luminous language" restates the closing action without added pressure. Filter-verb clusters ("she had discovered," "she had missed," "she had filled") in the latter third dull immediacy. Minor template cadence in the breakthrough section ("she breathed," "she adjusted," "she noted") triggers a −0.4 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well with longer textured sentences in description and shorter beats for action ("The gears began to hum"). Information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., the frozen library description establishes both setting and Elara's locksmith focus). No major loops or scaffold, and figurative language is controlled without muddle. Minor slips: "the rhythm of repair" appears twice (paragraph 3 and the mirrors revelation), creating a near-loop on the central metaphor; "soft hush of a distant morning" is lovely but borderline stock phrasing. The final paragraph's "this time, she would..." repetition works rhythmically but edges toward summary where scene might land harder. Sentence openings vary and no template cadence is evident. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is high. Some phrasing feels template-like: "watched them all grow old and die, watched their children inherit the groves, watched the community flourish" (anaphora that flattens rather than charges). "Brambled hope took root alongside the healing trees" stacks metaphor without embodied cost. The opening and closing images (bell chiming, butterflies dancing in light) are vivid, but mid-story beats summarize key actions (families gathering, grafting, mycologist's announcement) rather than showing them with high information density. No major loops or filter-verb stacks, but momentum sags in expository passages.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative language is dense and often lovely ("Atlantic dissolved into something older than oceans") but approaches saturation in high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching. Stock constructions appear: "weight of her story," "terrible love and impossible hope," "something larger than fear." Paraphrase loops: "nested pattern within a pattern—a life within a death within a promise" restates the concept without advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks modifiers and abstractions where concrete image would sharpen closure. Template cadence in the singing sequence: "he sang to every...," "the puppet's eyes...," "the lighthouse beam..." Information density is moderate; many lines do one job when two would tighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear with strong specific images (copper wings catching amber light, frost forming on stone). However, several lines show scaffold repetition: "Another lie, another truth" echoes the earlier structure, and "graceless beauty" appears multiple times as a descriptor. The opening of the backstory paragraph ("She'd discovered this ability the day...") reads as expository summary rather than integrated memory. Some sentences carry multiple jobs effectively ("The paper had refused to catch fire, and when she'd held it up in frustration, her shadow had somehow pressed through it"), but others feel padded ("watched their silhouettes disappear into the safety of the valley path"). Minor filter-verb stacking in reflective moments ("she knew") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and the polymer/music metaphor threads economically. The foam-description passage does multiple jobs (setting, character lens, thematic seed). No major loops or scaffolding. Modest deductions for mild overwriting in the insight sequence ("not failure but adaptation," "separation could become connection if you changed your frame of reference") where elevated diction slightly exceeds Marina's established voice under stress, and "loosened grief" repeated within close proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is largely clear with varied rhythm and strong imagery (glass branches tinkling, droplets forming, soap-bubble shimmer). Information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs. Overwriting penalty: figurative language appears in most sentences of the opening and closing without sufficient breathing room—crystalline leaves catching cloud-light, transparent trunk/heartwood metaphor, wisps of condensed dreams precipitating, all within three paragraphs. Template-cadence check: "Each one" recurs (paragraph two "each one precisely labeled," paragraph four "each gap representing," closure section "each one glowing"). Paraphrase loop: final two paragraphs restate "never quite arriving" / "stories that would never have to end" / "eternal opening" / "perpetual beginning" across multiple lines. Artifacts touch closure beat; apply −0.8 and disallow 9+ globally per patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and occasionally muddy: the fortress is "unrecognizable," memories "flood," the pavilion is a "frozen scream" and "monument," all within the opening quarter. The metaphor "sandpaper these rough memories smooth, to file down their jagged edges" is mixed (sandpaper doesn't file). Template cadence appears in the climax: "She felt them all: the garrison commander... The children... The merchants..." creates a list structure that flattens propulsion. Information density is strong in sensory detail, but paraphrase loops appear: "stored remorse" and "calcified regret" restate the same concept across adjacent paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("sentinel against the prairie sky," "acoustic bridges," "painting time signatures in the air") without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity and momentum in high-pressure beats. Template cadence runs appear in the middle section: "The second elevator joined in... Then the third, the fourth—each adding..." Stock metaphors accumulate ("drawing poison from a wound," "cosmic dance") without fresh inflection. Paraphrase loops occur between adjacent paragraphs that restate the elevators' response and neighbors' emergence. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere over advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, creating density but risking opacity: "helix-minded," "chaotically precise," "quaking reverie," "DNA strands that haunted," "dreams fossilized in metal and glass." Mixed metaphors appear ("memories...spiraling through time...in quantum entanglement"; "neural pathways...mapped to" mirror cracks). Template cadence recurs: "She wasn't just...she was becoming"; "She understood now that..."; "By dawn, she had catalogued..." Paraphrase loops touch the closure paragraph ("their dreams were no longer abandoned. They lived now in Vera's modified consciousness"). Information density is high, but propulsion stalls under the weight of metaphor, and the artifacts in the final third disallow 9+ globally per the Q7 rule.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in the opening ("always glowing," "Each manifestation," "Orin understood now") and near closure ("Orin understood," "The latent blaze") with synonym churn around "combinations" and "seeds." Metaphor density in the grotto passage (breathing organism, fossilized throat, silver rain) risks overwriting without clear payoff, and "metastasize" + "immune system" + "latent blaze" stack medical/fire metaphors inconsistently. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, but the prose leans ornate where leaner syntax would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "She approached... She pressed... She began..." and metaphor density in peak beats ("acoustic architecture," "musical memory," "ghost of birdsong") without pattern-teaching. The phrase "empathy in motion" reads as label-only insertion rather than embodied action. Minor scaffold and figurative stacking reduce clarity slightly, triggering a −0.4 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose carries vivid sensory anchors (basalt dent, iron-rust cliffs, magnetite pull) but suffers from template cadence in the middle third: multiple paragraphs open with a character name + dialogue tag + action beat in identical rhythm. "Thoughtfully precise" appears three times, once as unearned descriptor ("thoughtfully precise arrogance," "thoughtfully precise art"). Figurative language density is high but occasionally mixed: "correlate patterns" is used both literally (magnetic field) and metaphorically (silence into action) without clear vehicle logic. Paraphrase loop: "chess was merely one language for describing the universe's deeper games" near-echoes "to correlate patterns they'd never imagine" structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—most lines advance either the technical process, Mara's interior catalog, or the grandmother's philosophy. Clarity remains strong throughout; causal sequence is legible. Stock metaphor appears once: "paved with listening" in the grandmother's diary quote, but it's attributed text rather than narrator voice, so register drift is minimal. The line "responded to neither picks nor pleas" is a light alliteration that fits voice. Figurative density is controlled; no mixed metaphors or overwriting that obscures sense. Minor redundancy: "catalogue" and "cataloging" appear multiple times across paragraphs, creating slight lexical echo but not a loop. Propulsion is steady; no scaffolding or exposition dumps stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences vary in structure and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly ("The corpse flower seed arrived wrapped in brown paper..."). Imagery is often vivid ("mist rose from the forest floor far below like steam from a witch's cauldron") and sensory detail balances across sight, smell, and touch. However, several prose artifacts dull momentum: "days dissolved into weeks" is summary scaffold; "the breakthrough came at the turning of the tide's thought" stacks abstractions without concrete image; "overwhelming, beautiful, and terrible" is a label list rather than embodied perception; and the phrase "rooted at last in understanding" repeats the root/sway metaphor mechanically. Filter verbs ("she could smell," "she understood," "she discovered") cluster in the second half without voice necessity, and the final paragraph's syntax—"breathing deeply despite her sensitive nose, finding serenity within the chaos of sensation"—relies on participle stacking that flattens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies, openings shift, figurative language (whirling silence, water flowing upward) is vivid and coherent. Information density is high in the opening third. However, the monument paragraph ("The monument pulsed... pattern, a map written in metal and time") loops conceptually without advancing action, and "seeds of true understanding" plus "graceful defiance" repeat the closure assertion. Minimal scaffold or template cadence, but the ending paragraph tells rather than dramatizes the shift, reducing propulsion. No major artifacts touch clarity, but momentum softens at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. "The silence had descended twenty-three days ago. Not death—the population had simply stopped, frozen mid-motion like a paused film" demonstrates concise clarity. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: "She released…She marked…She turned…She approached…She documented…She began installing…She held…" across adjacent paragraphs creates a mechanical beat. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("Some accidents…weren't accidents at all but emergence—reality rapidly adapting") risks abstraction, though "the convergence pulsed like a slow heartbeat, waiting" recovers specificity. Minor paraphrase loop: "training evolving" and "protocols rapidly adapting" echo without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft shows strong individual images but suffers from overwriting and template cadence. Figurative density is high throughout ("ripples of violet that tasted of winter mint," "spiraling geometry," "liquid light," "cathedral of sensation") without pattern-teaching or sufficient breathing room, triggering the density penalty (−0.5). The final paragraph stacks summary and thematic labels ("wonder was once again essential," "oscillating repose," "sculpted hush") where a concrete image would land harder. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("painted sound across the ice" / "painted across the sky in frequencies"). Information density is moderate; many sentences do ornamental work rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm and strong imagery ("smoke through gauze," "cupped hands hold water"). Information density is high in middle beats. Two line-level issues: "arrangement" pattern (arranging driftwood, materialized figure) feels template-adjacent but not pervasive. Paragraph eight opens with "Through the woven space she'd created, insights began to flow" then restates in the next sentence "She saw her predecessors' error clearly now"—a mild paraphrase loop (−0.2). No major scaffold or figurative muddle in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled with high information load per sentence. Figurative language is heavy throughout—"constellation of meaning," "mathematics of ink and pressure"—but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "The sensation was," "The letters she chose," "The halo fragment grew." No paraphrase loops. Opening and closing images anchor well. The metaphor density occasionally slows momentum in non-closure beats but never muddles causality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in key beats (aurora sequence, Luminari manifestation). However, mild template cadence appears in the opening third: "This was where couriers came... This was what Corvin had taught... This was the Convergence Corvin had theorized" (three "This was" stems across four paragraphs). The final paragraph stacks declarative summary ("She was no longer just... but...") that borders on scaffold. No paraphrase loops or混ed metaphors harm clarity. Figurative language ("spine of ancient stone," "seeds waiting... to bloom") is coherent and does not cluster excessively in peak beats. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished with strong figurative language ("crystallized breath," "quartz pillars...leaned in"). However, multiple beats rely on paraphrase loops: "Vera knew better" / "But Vera knew better"; "The prism wasn't just storing emotions; it was translating them" restates prior content. Template stems recur: "The...waited," "The...responded," "The...struck." Figurative density in the climax beat—"emotions crystallizing," "fragments into golden spirals," "emotional archaeology"—stacks metaphors without varying rhythm, reducing propulsion. No closure-harming artifacts, so caps remain limited.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance situation or deepen stakes. Rhythm varies appropriately—short bursts during the weaving, longer sentences for backstory. However, several filter-verb instances ("she understood," "she could feel it testing") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy. "Stoically sparkling" appears three times, creating mild repetition. The phrase "raveling silence" and variants recur but serve pattern-building. Propulsion is strong overall, though the "weeks later" summary compresses what could be a tighter ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is generally strong; sentence openings vary. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "between understanding and confusion" appears twice as both setting detail and abstraction; "bartered awakenings" recurs as label without added texture. "Deliberate precision," "deliberate reconstruction," "deliberate redemptions" form a template cadence across beats (−0.5). Figurative density is high ("colors that shouldn't exist," "silk defied reason," "blade sang with azure defiance") without pattern-teaching, blurring peak moments (−0.4). "Cherry blossoms fell upward" is a strong closing image. Information density is adequate but hampered by scaffold phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled in most beats. However, the opening relies on stacked sensory metaphors ("rust became the taste of copper bells, engine grease transformed into violet whispers") that prioritize texture over clarity, and similar constructions recur ("harmonics from a dozen realities," "golden filaments stretching between worlds"). The phrase "cyclically spontaneous" appears twice, once as descriptor and once as thematic callback, bordering on loop. The climax beats are clear, but the final paragraph's summary tone ("their cyclically spontaneous gift transformed from curse to cure") deflates momentum. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she could feel it pulling") in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the climb and confrontation. Minor loop: "The lighthouse keeps us, but loneliness is worse than death" and the subsequent elaboration ("they'd all been watchers, protectors...") paraphrase the same idea without new pressure. Stock metaphor: "its dead eye a wound in the star-scattered sky" elevates slightly above purpose. The final image (tears falling like sea glass) is specific and propulsive. No major scaffolding, but a few stock constructions ("chill running through her bones," "ache of isolation") dull immediacy in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings show variety but template patterns emerge: "The [noun] [verb]" structures cluster ("The glass lantern wick responded," "The ritual deepened," "The wick's total internal reflection"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence metaphorizes, flattening the contrast needed for peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "She wasn't just guiding lost ships home. She was teaching reality itself how to navigate" restates rather than advances. The closure paragraph stacks abstract claims ("truths in languages not yet invented," "the universe steering itself through her voice") that obscure rather than sharpen the final image. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and rhythm are strong in most beats, but overwriting appears in clusters: "stories were said to gather like moths to flame," "colors had begun speaking to him in whispers," and the final paragraph stacks three metaphors (quietest explosions, fluid dye, sun trails drawing new paths) that blur rather than sharpen. Template cadence in backstory: "The indigo spoke... The vermillion hummed..." (parallel stems without escalation). Minor paraphrase loop: "stories need to flow through us, not settle in us" is then restated as "not to hold them but to transform them." High information density elsewhere ("chains of woven light that only appeared when touched by morning sun") keeps the piece propulsive. Apply −0.6 for figurative density in peak beats and template stems, total −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft shows strong specificity ("index mirror, the horizon glass, the graduated arc") and purposeful rhythm in the deconstructing sequence. However, several passages loop conceptually: the labyrinth as sorrow-processor is restated in multiple registers ("machine for processing sorrow," "quantified sorrow," "solving for x where x equals the weight of absence"). Template openings appear in adjacent paragraphs ("Marcus…," "The sextant…," "He…") without pattern-taught purpose. Minor simultaneity error: "By dawn, Marcus had installed" compresses complex work into summary rather than showing key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong, but several patterns recur: "They sang of X, of Y, of Z" structures appear multiple times; "not quite X but not quite not-X" is used twice in adjacent paragraphs. Metaphors are mostly coherent, though "swaddle emptiness itself" strains. Information density is high, and no major loops appear. The closure image is clear. However, elevated diction ("subsonic thrumming," "luminescence," "manifest") clusters in high-pressure beats without always serving POV or urgency, creating mild register drift. Minor scaffold: "This was what happened when a realm forgot how to wake—it simply never did" reads expository.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer reflection blocks) and information density is high—most sentences do multiple jobs. Paraphrase loop at "The woman's breathing steadied slightly" / "By then, I'd already found my way here" / "If I'd known earlier..." compresses three restatements of late-arrival regret without added pressure (−0.4). Filter-verb stack in paragraph four ("let him feel," "had driven," "had only sharpened") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. Opening line anchors stakes cleanly; final line recharges "enlarged tranquility" motif. Metaphor coherence holds (crumpled/folded papers as externalized internal states). No loops touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the tea house scene. However, the piece carries minor scaffold: "This tea house exists because you noticed. Your gardens gave it permission to grow" loops the same concept across adjacent sentences. "The sacred hides in ordinary things" + "love persists even after the ovens cool" veer toward stock wisdom phrasing. The final paragraph ("tasted of forgiveness and time") recaps rather than propels. No major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure cap applies (−0.4 max).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose clarity is strong with purposeful rhythm variation, but several loops and stock phrasings accumulate. "Luminous vow(s)" appears six times, becoming decorative rather than charged. Template cadence: "She began... She moved... She could save... Her fingers..." creates mechanical progression. The metaphor "warmth seeping from walls like blood from stone" is evocative but mixed (blood doesn't seep *from* stone; stone *holds* blood). Stock phrasing: "breath crystallized instantly," "ice cracking beneath her feet." The final paragraph's "gentle, meticulous light" nearly paraphrases the opening's "gently meticulous care" without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied rhythm and high information density. Opening and closing images anchor and recharge the watch fob motif. Minor loop: "trust breaking" recurs in description and final line, and "the sound of trust breaking" phrase appears three times, creating slight redundancy. Figurative language is generally strong ("recognition blooming like algae," "drowning in reverse") though the algae simile in still water feels ornamental. No major scaffold or template cadence; sentence openings vary and propulsion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple craft issues compound: paraphrase loops ("weather-carriers don't bring weather. We are weather"), template cadence in exposition blocks, and register drift into academic diction ("localized expressions of Earth's atmospheric consciousness"). The final paragraph layers abstractions ("terrestrially cosmic forces," "emergent compass points," "futuristic nostalgia") that obscure rather than sharpen the closure image. Stock metaphor "the future stretched ahead like her grandmother's ring, circular and infinite" dulls momentum. Information density is low in key beats where exposition restates rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density high; cave descent interleaves discovery and memory. Two paraphrase loops: "charcoal dust... permanent, like grief" restated as "charcoal would never leave her fingers" without added pressure; "understood now" followed by explanatory restatement of lock metaphor. Template cadence in middle: "The passage opened... There, propped... Lyra approached... Behind it, a second painting..." runs four consecutive subject-verb-object frames. Figurative language mostly clear but "geode's heart" and "cathedral of stone" stock. Micro-movements track without puppet-master excess. Opening and closing images anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density and momentum through most beats. Figurative language is purposeful ("morning condensation on glass," "dead zones between safety and poison"). Minor artifact cluster in final paragraph: "carefully maintained peace dissolve like morning condensation on glass" and "dead zones... had always been where the most important words went to wait" both lean slightly abstract-philosophical in a high-pressure closure beat, diluting immediacy by ~−0.3. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence variety supports rhythm without sluggishness.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythms, but several lines exhibit overwriting and figurative density that slows momentum: "wreathed in clouds that never lifted," "stone finger pointing at eternity," "gossamer of curiosity," "shock of discovering something beautiful and unexpected." The phrase "glististen" (a portmanteau of glisten/glitter) appears suddenly without pattern-teaching and then repeats, reading as a coinage rather than an earned effect. Minor scaffold appears in the final paragraphs with near-redundant phrasing about the bells' eternal song.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("wings of flame that folded inward," "thorns catching refracted light"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple dimensions. However, several phrases edge toward overwriting: "fragmented wholeness had become something else—a complete incompleteness, a perfect imperfection" stacks paradoxes without added clarity. "Strangely organic" appears three times as a repeated descriptor. The final paragraph's explanation ("The controlled burn had worked not by destroying the past but by miniaturizing it") summarizes rather than trusting the demonstrated action. Minor template cadence in the burn sequence: "The fear of X [verb]ed [color]" pattern repeats three times.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in mid-beats. Minor loops appear: "She understood now why…" immediately followed by expository clarification; "Her curator's instinct already knew" paraphrases the same knowledge. The final paragraph recycles "sandstorm calm" and "locked mailbox" as thematic bookends without added pressure, and "invisible network" plus "doorway" metaphors feel stock. No grammar errors, but two scaffold phrases ("As stars emerged," "In the morning, she would return") slow momentum without adding causal detail. The closure image ("this home") is clean, but the surrounding reflection dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong figurative control ("the familiar weight of destiny settled on her shoulders like an old coat found in an attic, smelling of memories she'd never lived"). However, scaffold redundancy appears: "The dice had always done that" immediately after showing it, and the final three paragraphs loop through thematic restatement ("understood now," "understood finally"). Template cadence emerges in the closing beat with repeated "some [noun]" constructions. The "patient spider" simile and "lyrical truth of inherited motion" elevate diction beyond Maya's established register without voice motivation. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and register drift touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmospheric pressure (e.g., "the gravity pockets fluctuated mysteriously there, strong enough to make visitors nauseous, weak enough that cremated ashes sometimes drifted upward like snow" does triple duty). Rhythm modulates well between reflection and discovery beats. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line ("tomorrow's coffee grounds would show new patterns, and Marina would read them with eyes that remembered how to grieve") recharges the coffee-ground motif without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense throughout: "invisible fruit," "jagged edges," "trillion smaller possibilities," "ember-glow." In high-pressure beats (the wing unfolding, prophecy fragments escaping), metaphorical layering slows propulsion rather than sharpening it—"blazing with potential energy" and "tranquil suspension" feel ornamental. Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm breathes, but several constructions loop conceptually: "she had learned" echoes across the piece, and "the summoner" / "she" toggle without clear rhythmic purpose. No paraphrase loops, but the density of vehicles (prophecy as living thing, silence as fruit, futures as blaze) occasionally muddles rather than clarifies. Information density is high, and grammar is clean; the final image is strong but preceded by a thematic summary that dilutes its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: "every word ever spoken was someone's attempt to build a bridge across the void of understanding" does multiple jobs. Figurative language is dense—meteor trails as threads, steam as incense, the building "settling into sleep"—but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor loop: "This was how he interrogated her" and "This ritual had evolved" use similar demonstrative openings within close proximity. The phrase "mysterious familiarity" in the final paragraph borders on abstract labeling where the prior scene work already established the tone. No major artifacts touch closure, keeping the score in the upper 6s.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong images: "purple blooms so dark they seemed to absorb the dying light," "dirt collecting under her fingernails like inverse stars." Information density is high. However, several beats loop conceptually: "skeptical of her own emptiness, charmed by the peace but haunted by its price" restates without advancing; "not as trauma but as teaching, not as weight but as wings" is a paraphrase-loop within one sentence. Template cadence appears in the closure paragraph: "no longer… but simply," "not by forgetting but by choosing," "not as… but as…" Figurative language is dense throughout without clear pattern-teaching, bordering on overwriting in high-pressure beats. Minor −0.6 for loops and template runs.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings show variety. Clarity is strong with no causality breaks. However, figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching—"marble sanctuary breathed," "aurora's green dance," "pearl twilight," "stalactites dripped their patient rhythm"—and much of it ornaments rather than advances pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She drew out... She pressed... She understood..." (repetitive "She [verb]" stems). Filter verbs cluster in reflective beats ("understood," "remembered," "smiled, understanding flooding"). Information density is moderate; several sentences restate the same thematic content (treason, forgiveness, completion) without adding pressure. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, but synonym churn appears around "forgery/forged/forgeries." Minor scaffold in transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse, but several lines lean toward overwriting: "each thread weaving through the air differently" after "her voice split into harmonics" restates the same image without added pressure. "The web of intrigue wasn't conspiracy but connection" summarizes rather than allowing discovery to land through scene. Template cadence in the backstory paragraph—"Not vanished...but transformed. The echo singers weren't missing; they had become"—creates a paraphrase loop (-0.3). Information density is generally strong, but the exposition about echo singers being "chosen by the universe's secret song" could be more compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid imagery ("warmth carving tiny rivulets," "whispered through rusted portholes"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "melted snow globe" recurs five times in opening paragraphs without variation; "woven/weaves/weaving" cycles through adjacent beats. Template cadence visible in exposition blocks: "She had learned... She placed... She had spent..." The filter-verb stack "had pulled," "had learned," "had been carrying," "had been" clusters in early paragraphs, dulling immediacy. Stock metaphor "breath on glass" and "borrowed starlight" repeated without fresh inflection. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high, with most lines layering image, action, and thematic resonance. However, template cadence appears in several passages: "her fingers working," "her needle paused," "she lifted," "she resumed," "she stood," "she descended"—a stem-repetition pattern that flattens propulsion in peak beats. Figurative density is near-constant: "living sparks," "captured stars," "invisible architecture," "moon paths," "scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity," "angles and intentions," "frequency," "silver gleam," "ephemeral and essential." While each image is clear, the accumulation without breathing room or grounding in plain sentence action triggers the overwriting density check (−0.5). Paraphrase loops: "small, unwitnessed acts" echoes "anonymous acts of care" and "hidden effort" across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively; information density is high (letter content, stillpoint mechanics, orchard history compressed efficiently). Opening and closing images (lazy clicks vs. fading clicks) frame the arc without force. Two micro-issues: "His sharply observant nature had saved countless people from scams, but this place defied explanation" uses filter-like summary where a concrete observational detail would sharpen; "The conspiracy theorists had been right about the stone but wrong about the curse" states the irony rather than letting the action carry it. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern payoff, especially in peak beats: "smoke through history's lungs," "electric veils," "reality's origami creases" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Template cadence appears in the storm sequence with repeated "The X verbed" stems. Paraphrase loops emerge around "broadcasting" and "frequencies" across adjacent paragraphs. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold phrases ("She pressed," "She began," "She smiled") add little. Propulsion slows in the middle third with summary rather than scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense ("tears carved clean tracks," "remembering love through frosted glass," "lonesome splendor") and mostly coherent, but "positively wistful" reads forced and the phrase "gleaned redemption" sits as an ornament rather than image. Template stems appear: "He'd discovered," "He'd learned," "He remained." The final two paragraphs loop the theme ("translator between generations," "keeper of what others thought lost") with near-synonyms. Paraphrase across adjacent lines in the ending ("transformed into something purposeful and profound" then "transformed from...into") triggers the loop penalty. The closure beat is readable but dulled by summary rather than a single propulsive image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, figurative language is dense throughout—nearly every sentence in the opening and middle carries metaphor or elevated diction ("azure coat billowing like wings of forgotten birds," "honey and blood," "song that would echo through fog and time")—which risks overwriting without a taught pattern. Two minor paraphrase loops: "the artifact floated... pulsed with bioluminescent patterns" is restated as sensory immersion in the next beat without added pressure. No template cadence or scaffold, and the final image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm, supporting the calm-then-urgent progression: short declaratives at the opening, longer interleaved syntax during the rod placement. Information density is generally high; figurative language (basalt as organ pipes, ice as glass, revolution as freezing water) coheres without muddle. Minor deductions for adjacent near-restatements: "The revolution would not be loud. It would move like water freezing…" and "true revolution wasn't about sudden upheaval, but about the patient accumulation…" loop the same concept. The phrase "subtly vibrations only a horizon mapper could detect" may intend "subtle" (minor typo). Template stems appear in the final third ("Some would…others would…"), reducing propulsion slightly. No major scaffold, but the ending edges toward summary rather than image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and several sentences do double duty (rain as drought-break and tunnel echo, lantern as signal and memory trigger). However, the middle third cycles through paraphrase loops: "The lantern had been calling... Jerome had answered" is restated as "The lantern had shown him another way" and again as "the lantern's weight... felt like a promise." Stock metaphors cluster in the final paragraph ("wall between," "baptized by the storm"). Template cadence in the memory cascade ("She saw Jerome... saw him returning... saw a conductor") flattens momentum. No critical clarity breaks, but density suffers from synonym churn and scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("The morning sun fought through dissipating storm clouds" vs. the short "You came"), and information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Opening and closing lines frame stakes effectively. Minor loops appear: "broken shafts of gold" / "fractured beams" repeat the same image within two paragraphs, and "vibrant hush" recurs three times across the piece as a descriptor without added pressure each time. The final paragraph stacks elevated metaphors ("blessing what was broken," "steady as absolution, sure as grace") that blur into near-paraphrase and slightly dull momentum. Total artifact penalty: −0.6 for template recurrence and synonym churn in non-closure beats, plus −0.3 for figurative density in the closing image that risks overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the mechanical-consciousness lexicon creates textural cohesion. Information density is generally high: "her brass wings clicking against chains that held her above the bubbling green expanse" does multiple jobs. However, several beats loop conceptually: "transliterating violence into vision" / "transliterating death into data" / "transliterate violence into a new vocabulary" restates the same idea across three paragraphs without advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks metaphoric equivalencies ("the arrow and the target, the hunter and the horizon") that feel like thematic summation rather than propulsion. Minor filter-verb stacks ("watched Pioneer," "felt it too") in mid-beats slightly dull immediacy but don't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, figurative language is controlled ("graveyard of deleted profiles," "infinite library"), and information density is high—most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deductions: "brightly attentive" reads slightly precious and recurs without embodied stakes; "the echo of forgotten songs" in the penultimate paragraph is elevated but vague, a rare moment of overwriting. Filter verbs ("noticed," "recognized," "realized") cluster in discovery beats, dulling immediacy slightly. Overall propulsion is clean and the closure image lands crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.3)
    句Sentence rhythm is controlled and paragraph structure varies purposefully. However, multiple lines rely on abstract metaphor stacks ("shadow-laced," "shadow-woven," "gentle darkness") and elevated diction ("reconstituting," "crystallizes," "cartography of empathy") that create a consistent lyric wash rather than sharpening under pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "warmth generates from understanding" in the climax echoes "warmth pulse through wood" in the opening without added pressure. The final paragraph over-explains theme ("proof that...") where image alone would suffice. No hard artifacts touch closure, but density could tighten throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery and varied syntax. Information density is high in sensory and thematic material. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the peculiar crease in time where waiting becomes its own form of movement" is restated as "patience can fold into itself until waiting becomes its own form of completion." Template cadence in the final paragraph: "She'd come... but discovered..." then "But Marlene would remain... learning... adding..." The metaphor density in high-pressure beats (parasol as rosary, ice as cemetery/amber/symphony) occasionally stacks without clear progression. Minor −0.6 for loops and template stems in closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean and rhythmically varied, but reflection dominates (~40% of the text is backstory) and several beats suffer from synonym churn and template phrasing: "destined mismatches," "gently persuasive," "passionate subtlety" recur as labels rather than being dramatized through varied action. The opening line ("amber pavilion...honey crystallizing in air") is vivid, but figurative density remains high across multiple paragraphs without pattern-teaching or payoff that alters Marcus's present stance. Paraphrase loop: "some truths needed preserving" (paragraph 2) restated as "incomplete but absolutely essential" (final line) without added pressure between. Minor filter-verb stack in the memory section ("he'd told her," "she'd said," "he'd watched") dulls immediacy. Information density is moderate; many lines serve thematic resonance rather than advancing present-scene pressure. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but mid-story momentum sags under reflective weight.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is adequate; no major loops or causality breaks. However, several sentences restate without adding pressure: "The clearings must become sanctuaries" after "consecrate the spaces between" is near-paraphrase. Template cadence appears in the consecration sequence: "Standing... began... speaking... shimmered... becoming." The phrase "strangely honest" recurs three times as a tic without dramatized meaning. "Murmuring" and "whisperfield calm" are invoked repeatedly but remain abstract. Information density is moderate; the pavilion descent and map-of-light moment advance atmosphere but not causal pressure. No figurative muddle, but the prose leans toward declarative summary rather than propulsive specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clarity is high and figurative language is mostly coherent—"grief itself, traced," "vines climb," "bodies as brushstrokes"—but density sags in the middle third where timeline exposition ("1952: five workers...1967: thirty...1984: over a hundred") lists rather than dramatizes. Paraphrase loop: "transmute pain into beauty" / "transmute inherited pain into beauty" / "transmuted industrial trauma into intergenerational art" recurs across three paragraphs with synonym churn. Stock metaphor: "future they were finally learning to compose together" and "threads of shared sorrow and stubborn hope" are generic high-level descriptors. The final two paragraphs stack thematic summary instead of propelling through image. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 2–3 ("recognized," "possessed," "showed," "lingered") dulls immediacy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template summary; −0.3 for filter clustering. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, so cap at mid-band rather than lower.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively; the opening's long, layered syntax gives way to shorter declaratives at the ending. Information density is high, with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "breath fogging the ancient glass" anchors time, temperature, and Elena's proximity). Two minor artifacts: "Here, a shelf... there, new words..." presents a mild list structure, and "grief-tender" / "time-drunk" read as crafted neologisms that pause momentum mid-documentation. The final paragraph's "The crystal sang with reflected sound—every whisper the library had ever held, every word yet to be born..." stacks abstractions in a high-pressure beat, reducing propulsion slightly. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths modulate with scene beats. Information density is high: "fog sculptures breathed around him, and in their shifting forms he saw the woman approaching before he forgot he'd seen her" layers prophecy, forgetting, and present. Minor overwriting in "the strange sorrow of understanding he'd known this moment would arrive but had lost it to his peculiar forgetfulness"—the clause stack slightly dulls momentum. One paraphrase loop: "magnetic decay" / "deteriorating plastic" / "degrading and preserving" recurs without added pressure. No scaffold or template cadence. Grammar and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many lines doing double duty (e.g., the cables "hummed with tension" conveys both literal vibration and metaphorical stress). Two artifacts lower the score: "changelessly constant rotation" is a paraphrase loop, and "luminous ache" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment in the final paragraph. The spinning hand's acceleration and the tuning fork's note are rendered with sensory specificity, but "gossamer threads" and "quantum gaps" lean toward stock figurative language in a peak beat. Pronoun references stay clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong. Minor overwriting in the opening: "suspended between earth and sky on the hospital's tenth floor" states what the prior image already showed. "Decisively kind hands that never trembled" is assertive labeling rather than embodied gesture. The phrase "pulsing stillness" recurs twice, and "the scent of hope—that's what Maya called the particular blend" interrupts momentum with exposition. "Hymning the mundane" and related passages ("making sacred the ordinary sounds") lean toward stock lyricism. No paraphrase loops or syntactic uniformity. Sentence openings vary. Information density is high in the recording-project paragraph. The final paragraph's triple parallel ("their breathing, their presence, their willingness") is purposeful but borders on rhythmic sameness.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level control is strong; rhythm varies, imagery is specific ("shadows that fell upward at noon," "brass secretary that had written down every astronomical observation"). Information density is high across beats. Minor scaffold: "Three months had passed since the Spoon Convergence—that terrible dawn when kitchen drawers worldwide erupted..." front-loads exposition in apposition rather than weaving through present action. The final two paragraphs drift into summarized consequence rather than live image, lowering closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (garden description establishes both setting and theme). Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Figurative language ("belief could bend like willow branches") appears frequently but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor template cadence: "She looked seventeen now…She sat on the moss-covered bench…She touched the fountain's edge" in paragraphs 8–13 shows repetitive stems. The nest repair beat demonstrates strong specificity and propulsion. No paraphrase loops, but the repeated "knew/know" in paragraphs 11–12 edges toward synonym churn without quite crossing. Final line recharges Mother's song motif effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Two prose artifacts lower the score: (1) The opening's metaphoric density ("liquid starlight," "serpentine," "something ethereal, almost breathing") in rapid succession reads decorative rather than propulsive. (2) The final paragraph's thematic summary loops conceptually ("pearl of stillness… quiet certainty… patience and polish rather than power and heat… brightest lights… glow softest… tender persistence") without advancing the image. No template cadence or paraphrase loops elsewhere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports rhythm. Grammar and punctuation are clean. The clarity-momentum balance holds until the closing lines, where tell overtakes show.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm and strong imagery (honeyed hush, emerald tapestries, concentric moss circles). Information density is high in the garden description. Two artifact patterns lower the score: paraphrase loops in the opening (moss "claimed everything" / "nature reclaimed" within three sentences) and template cadence in the final paragraph ("this transformation," "this quiet revolution," "this—this quiet revolution"). The phrase "Her story might be viral now, but this—this quiet revolution—would outlast any headline" is serviceable closure rhetoric but leans on scaffold repetition ("this—this") rather than fresh synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("sculptures of rust and rebellion," "shapes of their hopes"). Two paraphrase loops: "She'd been writing it backward, against time's current, beginning with endings and searching for origins" echoes prior reflection on the manuscript's structure; "It would close with a whisper… It would end the way all true stories end" restates the same closure idea across adjacent sentences. Template cadence in the final paragraph: three consecutive "It would" constructions. Elevated register ("solemnize," "ephemeral," "lucidly") saturates high-pressure beats without voice modulation. Net penalty in mid-band: −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for register uniformity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and syntax supports scene needs without mechanical templates. Information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (e.g., "her weathered fingers tracing the withered tendril" establishes both character age and ritual decay). However, several phrases lean into stock lyricism: "bruised with night's departure," "melody wound through the air like morning mist," "luminous tales that made children laugh and elders weep." These figurative runs in high-pressure beats (the humming sequence, the bloom) slightly dull immediacy. No loops or scaffold detected, and clarity remains intact throughout. Grammar and punctuation are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; clarity is high, and figurative language (starlight "remembered," trees "grasping at sky") enriches without obscuring. Information density is solid—most lines advance setting, process, or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The pattern was nearly complete" followed immediately by six- and eight-week summaries restates timeline without new pressure. Template-cadence runs ("She had been… She traced… She'd been… She uncorked…") in mid-section slightly dull momentum. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat but merit a modest deduction in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and purposeful with strong imagery: "veins of quartz that spiraled through limestone walls like frozen lightning," "moments that hadn't quite happened yet." Rhythm modulates appropriately—longer contemplative sentences in observation beats, tighter syntax during the realization. Minor scaffold appears in "She'd learned" constructions (appears three times), creating slight template cadence. Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or clarity issues. The figurative language occasionally clusters but remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several passages loop conceptually: the "boundary-lessly trapped" idea is restated three times without added pressure, and "seventeen grams" recurs as incantation rather than tactical detail. Mixed metaphor in "whale-rib" fractals that "breathe with prehistoric patience" and "calcify" blurs the physical logic. Elevated diction ("oxidized brass," "vertices," "sediment") is consistent but occasionally drifts toward ornamental density in high-pressure beats, slowing momentum. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("weightlessness," "paradox," "prayer to patterns") where a sharper image would land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short urgent beats during carving ("The knife steadied in her grip") alternate with longer reflective passages. Information density is high—most lines advance character understanding or atmosphere without padding. Sentence openings vary effectively. Two friction points: "hauntingly practical" recurs as a stock phrase in different contexts without fresh specificity; the phrase "here and gone" appears multiple times as a structural echo that borders on template. The simile "like tears that wouldn't fall" and "here and gone like smoke" function cleanly. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat, which remains imagistically clean.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally clean with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. The opening effectively anchors setting and stakes, and the final line ("as if learning how") recharges the lagoon motif. Minor issues include paraphrase loops in the ghost dialogue passage ("You think I've given up…But these fragments—they're instructions") and a filter-verb stack in the middle section ("She couldn't remember if she'd found it…she could never tell if they came from last week or last century") that slightly dulls immediacy. No template cadence or synonym churn touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is high; no spatial confusion or timeline breaks. Sentence variety is adequate, though several paragraphs open with "Maya" or "She" in runs. Paraphrase loops appear: "The terminal wasn't just abandoned; it was dormant" followed by "The terminal had been built by engineers who understood..." restates setup without added pressure. Figurative language—"hydraulic brain," "maze of intentions," "infrastructure as art"—clusters heavily in the final third without pattern-teaching, veering into abstraction. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She understood," "Maya understood," "she simply watched") dull immediacy in key beats. Information density is good early but declines into thesis in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia," "excruciatingly gentle," "crystal whispers," "symphony." Several beats layer metaphor without functional payoff—e.g., "thunderous applause she'd once imagined" and "stone in her chest" are stock images. Rhythm varies but some sentences share template stems ("The forecourt's… / The sanctuary's… / The crystal…"). Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 4 and 6 both restate that her chronicles became elaborate compositions. Clarity remains high; momentum is slowed by descriptive density in mid-passage rather than artifacts that obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean and largely free of artifacts. Information density is high in the opening and closing paragraphs. However, the middle section relies on summary scaffolding ("She thought of," "She'd spent," "She understood now") that recounts rather than dramatizes key realizations. The phrase "serene upheaval" appears twice, and "architecture of lies" three times; while thematically intentional, the recurrence without fresh context borders on template cadence. Sentence variety is present, but runs of "She'd [verb]" in the backstory section flatten momentum. The closing image—pocketing the sundial, touching the canal wall—provides concrete action, but the final paragraph's explicative summary ("she understood that every legend") tells what has already been shown. Minor loop: "salvaging truth" recurs in nearly identical form.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors and clear action sequencing. Information density is high in the knot-decoding beats. However, mild scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "The secret weavers had never been a formal organization, she'd learned, but rather a natural emergence" followed by similar restatements about shepherds and nomads. Template stems recur: "She pulled out her journal… She stood… She would give her…" The final paragraph edges toward summary ("by morning she would need to teach") rather than staying in present action. Deductions total approximately −0.6 for loops and scaffold that dull momentum in the closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense—"incense smoke," "divining rod," "threads of crimson silk"—and coherent within the elegiac register, yet stacks in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without breathing room, risking overwriting (−0.4). A paraphrase loop appears: "Each pulled thread revealed another story, another life" echoes "their souls already halfway to wherever souls go" in restating the living-dead conceit (−0.2). Information density is high and rhythm supports the accumulative design, but the closure paragraph—"And Elara, keeper of their stories..."—summarizes rather than dramatizes the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is often lyrical and controlled, but multiple anti-patterns appear: paraphrase loops ("succeeded and failed simultaneously" echoes "bitter sweetness"), stock metaphors (robes "hung like cobwebs," tears as nutrient solution), and template cadence in the assembly sequence. The phrase "fevered brightness of mystics and madmen" is a cliché cluster. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, and "tick-tick-tick" and "dream within a dream" feel ornamental. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce momentum and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in ritual beats. Several strong image-action fusions: "black sand from the volcanic beach through her fingers. Each grain fell with the weight of memory." Significant weaknesses: multiple paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences ("She was not her father's fire, nor was she merely its opposition. She was the child of both flame and water, destruction and preservation, grafted together") and repeated scaffold structure ("not as he was... but as he had been"). Stock metaphor "scars can sing" appears three times. The phrase "unyielding compassion" repeats four times across the piece without evolution. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph: declarative summary sentences stack without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is legible but carries repeated metaphor stacking ("thick and viscous as amber," "patient fury of geological ages," "temporal residue") that slows momentum without clarifying stakes. Paraphrase loops appear: "memories were never truly trapped" / "they were composting" restates the same idea. Template cadence recurs in "Marcus approached... Marcus felt... Marcus held..." Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "understood") cluster in peak beats. Information density is uneven; the seventeen-year backstory and Prague/Kyoto anomalies are scaffolding that does not alter present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid without overwriting most beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The pattern would continue, approximating infinity through repetition, each cycle a verse in an endless poem" restates prior content without added pressure. The final paragraph recycles exposition ("tending," "watching them bloom and fade," "sharing the light of dying stars") in template cadence. Clarity is high, but information density drops in the closing third. No major artifacts obscure causality, so deductions remain within the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images are strong. However, several phrases edge toward stock metaphor: "iron bones black against the salmon sky," "thundering calm...like distant storms." The phrase "his voice carrying that thundering calm she remembered—powerful yet serene, like distant storms" loops the descriptor with synonym churn. Template cadence appears in the families list: "The Nguyens who lost...The Johnsons whose...The Garcias whose..." Clarity remains high throughout; no causality breaks from line-level issues.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with strong sensory detail and varied syntax, but several beats rely on paraphrase loops: "Each tick...marked a promise" followed immediately by "He had broken that promise." The final paragraph stacks abstract nominalizations ("perpetual redemption," "ethical vigilance," "courage to emerge") and runs long without propulsive rhythm. Template cadence appears in the confession sequence: "Margaret Henley...two minutes," "Thomas Chen...seventeen seconds"—functional but formulaic. Figurative language is dense in the climax ("words...were offerings, acknowledgments") without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies appropriately, with longer contemplative sentences ("The fabric felt ancient yet alive…") and shorter beats at key moments ("Tonight felt different."). Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or thematic resonance. However, several paraphrase loops and near-synonym clusters appear: "encoding memory into matter itself" and "woven this fragment to preserve not facts but feelings, not history but the tender organization of love" restate similar ideas without added pressure. "The shape of intentions wasn't angular or defined—it was circular, seasonal, returning always to the same essential act of care" explains what the prior paragraph showed. Template cadence in the tapestry-decoding section: "The first thread spoke… The second told… Thread by thread…" Minimal figurative muddle, though "velveteen gloom" recurs three times, crossing from motif into slight overuse. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems in a non-closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is strong, rhythm varies, and information density is high in the opening third. Mid-story, paraphrase loops appear: "not about recording what was, but revealing what could be" echoes "maps of places that didn't exist—yet" without added pressure. The penultimate paragraph's "not through revolution but through evolution, not by destroying systems but by teaching them to dream" stacks parallelism into thesis statement, dulling propulsion. Template cadence in Council description ("The engineer would notice… The botanist would see… The programmer would recognize") across three beats merits −0.4 per the loop screen. Final aggregate: −0.6 for paraphrase/template runs.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong sensory anchors and no major loops, but several lines edge toward overwriting: "the dial glow that painted her fingers in amber light," "elusive song lyrics," "thistled calm—prickly at the edges but serene at its core." The phrase "secretly luminous" recurs four times, twice as identical construction, creating minor template cadence. Information density is generally high (transcription, dust-mixing, pirate broadcast mechanics), though the penultimate paragraph's list of future effects ("Dreams would return first… Then memories… Finally, the ability to imagine") reads as scaffold summary rather than propulsive image. No grammatical errors; syntax supports momentum except where figurative language clusters in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("negative space through which she sifted ash," "rocking chair finally slowed to a stop") is controlled without overwriting. Information density is high in the opening and craft beats. Minor scaffold appears in parallel structures ("found Thomas Creech... found Marlene... found the space") and a paraphrase loop ("The portrait was perfect—not because it showed who he truly was, but because it captured who he'd desperately wanted to be" echoes the prior tell about his self-image). The retrospective exposition paragraphs ("What they didn't know," "This was the mirage") slow momentum in the final third, though they clarify theme. No loops touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong imagery ("drowned ruins," "green-tinted water"). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent explanatory moves: "This came from a seafarer's chronometer...Your team dated it to 1847" followed immediately by "The metallurgy confirms what you want to believe" loops the evidence-rejection beat without added pressure. Template cadence in the woman's exposition: "He died in the plague, but not before teaching me...A chronometer doesn't just tell time—it tells you where you are." The journal's weight metaphor ("heavier than water-soaked leather should be, as if it contained the mass of all the competing narratives") edges toward overwrought but stays on the functional side of the line.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: the opening long compound gives way to shorter beats during the students' arrival. Information density is high in the first third (zither history, teaching method, program closure compressed efficiently), though the middle section summarizes key action ("By evening, they had found all five modes") rather than showing friction. One paraphrase-loop touch: "They were not recreating authentic Chinese music. Chen knew this. They were creating something new from something vanishing..." restates without added pressure (−0.2). The metaphoric throughline (autumn, absorption, transformation) is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding mixed vehicles. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The final image—"humming five different modes that somehow, impossibly, harmonized"—lands cleanly and charges prior material, though "impossibly" slightly over-signals the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean with varied syntax and purposeful sensory detail. However, several metaphors clash or overreach: "rusted greenhouse stood like a skeleton" (functional), but "memories are like weeds" followed by "memories leaked slowly into her consciousness like honey" mixes vehicles without clear logic. The phrase "informally wise" reads as awkward coinage. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "encoding not just one memory but thousands, weaving them into something unprecedented" restates the same idea. Filter verbs cluster in reflective beats without adding tension. No major loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the transformation sequence (translucent shoot, bioluminescent signals, constellation maps of synapses) accumulates without clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift appropriately. Information density is high—most lines advance situation or character. Minor template cadence in the citizens' arrival paragraph: "their faces soft... their drone-dulled eyes..." paired descriptors. "Nectar-sweet evening air" and "drops of liquid gold" trend decorative in high-pressure beats. The closing metaphor "truths were meant to sting before they could heal" is functional but borders stock. No paraphrase loops or major filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is consistent through the climb and broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean and propulsive with strong figurative choices ("liminal hour," "quiet...burning away the day's accumulated noise like fever burning infection"). Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or understanding. Two mild loop patterns: "she'd come here following a pattern" / "she'd traced the path" near-paraphrase in adjacent paragraphs, and "she understood" / "Marina understood" repeated openings in the final third. The metaphor "hush...blazing" is bold but works. Sentence openings vary well. No major clarity breaks, but the loops and filter-verb stacks in peak beats prevent entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; the cascading-revelation sequence uses parallel structure ("The first vision...The second revealed...The third exposed") that feels earned rather than mechanical. Some minor scaffold: "Thessaly felt something shift" followed by "Not movement—that was still impossible—but a kind of settling" loops conceptually. The phrase "threading memories through Marina's consciousness" recurs as "threading her air hose," creating unintended echo. Information density is high throughout, with sensory detail woven into action. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping it clean.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is propulsive and imagistic—"pip bleeding into dimensional space," "entropy disguised as wear." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, paragraphs shift length with pressure. Minor loop: "The dice clattered again" at paragraph five echoes earlier dice-rolling without adding pressure in that beat. "Measured recklessness" and "elegant prison" are slightly elevated for the POV but not pervasive. Information density is high; nearly every line advances character or concept. The final paragraph avoids explaining and lands on image. No major clarity issues, but the loop and two phrases prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing anchor with the greenhouse and moonlight. Information density is high in the painting sequence ("Each stroke was a memory"). Minor scaffold appears in the penultimate paragraph: "most moving were the stories" telegraphs its own importance. The phrase "methodically hopeful" feels slightly imposed in the painting beat. No paraphrase loops; figurative language (gauze, frost, seeds) remains coherent and sparse enough to avoid overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (rosewater, weeping walls, carbon and flour dust). Several lines carry layered meaning ("alphabet of belonging," "tomb of culture rather than its sanctuary"). Weaknesses: the final paragraph stacks abstraction and paraphrase loops—"resistance against erasure," "cataloging of the disappeared," "small victory against forgetting"—that restate the theme without advancing scene pressure. The phrase "working through the night" tells duration rather than showing a final beat. Filter verbs ("thought of," "realized") appear frequently in reflective passages but do not stack densely enough to trigger the artifact penalty. Minor template cadence in mid-section ("she had been right," "she realized") lowers momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats. Minor overwriting appears: "sound like time itself cracking" and "bleak exhilaration" edge toward elevated register without full payoff. One paraphrase loop: "understanding flooding through her" echoes "she understood" two sentences prior. The figurative density in the hunger-stone description ("void that pulled at her vision," "living shadow") is pattern-consistent and legible. No major scaffolding or template cadence, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing images anchor well ("mirrors still held their light" / "carnival stood silent behind her, finally allowed its rest"). However, minor loops appear: "fear itself" and "Fear" as entity are cycled without added nuance, and the "photographically cursed" motif is restated ("photographing her memories," "photographically cursed walls") in adjacent beats without pressure change. Figurative density is high ("voice like silk being pulled through broken glass," "formaldehyde") but one mixed metaphor—formaldehyde floods rather than illuminates—muddies the closure beat slightly. Propulsion remains steady; no major scaffolding or template cadence, but synonym churn on "fear" (Fear, terror, afraid) across the final third dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery ("the mallet grew warm in her hand, its ancient wood remembering its underwater years"). Information density is generally high, integrating setting, action, and atmosphere in single beats. However, several lines loop conceptually: "restless euphony that demanded she continue" echoes earlier "restless" descriptions without added pressure; "sketched resonance—temporary sound-shapes" and "invisible architecture" describe the same phenomenon in adjacent clauses. The final paragraph stacks thesis statements ("every obstacle...was simply an unplayed instrument") that paraphrase the established premise rather than advance it. Template cadence appears in the whales paragraph where "drawn by" and "adding" constructions feel formulaic. These artifacts concentrate in the final third, preventing higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately and information density is high; most lines advance situation or atmosphere. Two minor issues: "The need to know. The need to question. The need to understand why" is a template-cadence run of three parallel stems at a peak beat (−0.4). "Quietly driven" appears twice with similar phrasing ("quietly driven to understand," "quietly driven by something stronger"), a mild echo. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, figurative language ("like a prayer unanswered," "mouth waiting to swallow her whole") is coherent, and the final image is charged without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence rhythm and no major loops or scaffold. "The illuminated letter rested... Its gold leaf catching" and "The ivy rustled... wind swept" create purposeful sensory anchors. Minor template cadence in the exposition block ("Every war fought in its name, every life sacrificed for its glory—all based on forgeries") where parallel syntax stacks without propulsion. One paraphrase loop: "'The Ministry wants the letter destroyed'... 'Why shatter it now?'" and Elara's reply restate the same thesis across two beats without added pressure. No artifacts touch the closure beat; information density is high in the manuscript-display section.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The drawbridge groaned upward behind Edmund Harrow, sealing him on the island" anchors action, stakes, and isolation). Two minor frictions: "hushed blaze of late afternoon light" mixes fire and quiet in a strained vehicle, and "patient violence of water and time" approaches stock phrasing. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 4: "interlaced absence" concept is stated then immediately explained with near-duplicate language. Figurative density is high in the middle third but remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; information density is high (each paragraph advances situation or reveals pattern). Clarity is strong in technical sequences. Two friction points: "tranquilly perceptive purpose" front-loads modifiers awkwardly; "Each mark was an act of dappled resolve" in climax leans ornamental when momentum wants economy. Paragraph on "As she worked, she began to recognize a pattern" employs efficient telling to compress discovery. No loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language (algae's eternal pulse) stays coherent and sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately and information density is generally high, with many lines serving dual purposes (advancing both craft process and emotional arc). However, several passages exhibit template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She captured Lin's first steps... She preserved the sound of Lin singing" mechanically parallels structure, and "perfect and untouchable" / "untouchable" within two sentences is redundant. The metaphor system occasionally strains coherence—"shadow-plague" that "detaches" operates differently from "grief itself" being folded like paper, and "ascending descent" is repeated rather than developed. The final paragraph over-explains the transformation with abstract summary ("transform grief not by destroying it, but by giving it new shape") where the lantern image should carry the work. Minor register drift into therapeutic language ("acceptance," "transformation") in peak beats. Overall propulsion is good, but line-level polish shows seams.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no obvious template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high in the quantum-science passages. Minor overwriting in the middle third: "not with light but with possibility itself" and "pools of unused potential" recur without added specificity. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("The unfiltered awakening had begun. Tomorrow's stolen dreams would find new dreamers.") where a single concrete image would land harder, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates purposefully. Some strong images ("twilight...widening," "copper light bleeding") create texture. However, repeated template stems appear: "The pilgrim [verb]," "Kira [verb]," and paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third ("heat signatures in the walls—not random patterns but constellation maps, each one corresponding to a missing matrix" restates information from prior beats). Filter-verb stacks ("had been mapping," "had dismissed," "had been detecting") dull immediacy in exposition. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops under the patterned-artifact pack; no additional deduction elsewhere per routing rule.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor well. Information density is high—most sentences advance discovery or character. Minor template cadence in the realization paragraph: "He'd inherited...He'd inherited...He'd doctored...he'd helped" creates a brief drumbeat (−0.3). "The weight of unspoken words" and "weight of withheld truth" form a purposeful echo rather than loop. One paraphrase near the end: "manufactured memories" restated as "false genealogies he'd created" (−0.2). Clarity remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies well ("The brass drawer pull weighed nothing... yet it anchored her"), and information density is high—most lines do double duty. Figurative language is controlled ("neutral territory stretched like a scar between two wounds") without density overload. Two minor artifacts: "relief disguised as exhaustion" and "confusion etching deeper lines" are filter-adjacent shortcuts, and "the apology threaded through each word" slightly tells what the next line will show. The phrase "furrowed hush" recurs purposefully but borders on over-reliance as atmospheric shorthand. No loops or template cadence; propulsion is strong through the apology exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the pole-counting sequence. Two minor loops appear: "broken" repeats across adjacent beats without added pressure ("broken things"/"broken navigator" within three lines near closure), and "gravitating" appears twice in similar constructions. The metaphor "backlash of regrets...like waves eroding" is apt but followed immediately by "fragments remained," mixing erosion and breakage without clear vehicle. Template cadence in the backstory paragraph ("He'd been...until that night...when his calculations...") slightly flattens momentum but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening "surgical scars still ached" anchors physicality and stakes cleanly. Several lines do double duty (the baseball signature reveals time travel and seeds the thematic turn). Weaknesses: "Each bridge leads to someone connected to your victims—people whose empathy died when their loved ones did" is a paraphrase loop (the second clause restates the first). "The labyrinth stretched before him, each path a choice, each choice a chance" is template parallelism without added pressure. "Behind him, the old woman watched until his silhouette merged with the cave's bioluminescent glow, another ghost becoming light" stacks two metaphors in sequence without integrating them. These artifacts cluster in the final third, dulling the closure image's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong visual images (pearl-white blossoms, liquid moonlight, vial uncorking). However, the transformation beat accumulates stock phrases: "edges blur," "prickled as fur sprouted and receded," "burst forth and dissolved"—these gestures tell metamorphosis rather than selecting one concrete, impossible sensation to anchor the reader. The fortune "burned into her memory" is a cliché. Sentence rhythm varies well in the opening but flattens during the climax into a list-like catalog of perspectives. The final moth image is vivid and earns its placement, partially offsetting mid-sequence density loss.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language is dense and largely coherent ("morning glories climbing invisible trellises," "black snow"), but the accumulation—especially in mid-passage ("beauty of it pressed against her throat, choking her")—risks overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to escalation. Minor template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("her mother had done," "her mother appeared," "her mother said"). The phrase "willingly perplexed" recurs three times, once as decorative callback. Information density is high, but several beats loop thematically (the traced-hands explanation appears twice). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the final image is clean. No major causality-breaking artifacts, but the density and recurrence patterns nudge into ornamental territory in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, opening with longer contemplative structures and tightening during the stitching sequence. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "warships becoming gardens, prison walls transformed to shelters" delivers both history and transformation). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The line "She smiled, feeling herself rise, weightless with a joy tempered by understanding" balances concrete action with interior state cleanly. Minor elevations of diction ("topology of sorrow," "opalescent sheen") are voice-motivated and legible within the monastic register. The closing image—"her ghostly resolve now transformed into luminous acceptance"—leans abstract but functions as a purposeful conceptual closure rather than scaffold. Zero line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, and clarity is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is moderate; several lines do double duty (e.g., "ancient glass bottles" + bioluminescence + lava competition). However, elevated diction saturates high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "silk becoming iron becoming starlight," "gritty smoothness of change itself," "vibrant hush" cluster densely and create register drift from any plausible POV lexicon. Paraphrase loops appear ("transformation not as an event, but as a texture" / "the texture she'd sought to understand"). Minor scaffold ("Now, destitute by choice") and filter-verb stacks at closure ("She understood now," "She felt it then") dull propulsion. Cumulative artifact load: baseline −0.8 in Q7; figurative density in peak beats adds −0.4; total adjustment −1.2 within non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is moderate: many sentences do double duty (bronze surface reflects walls *and* holds engravings). However, template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "Thorne moved... Thorne placed... Thorne stood... Thorne and Amara separated" across adjacent paragraphs, plus near-duplicate constructions for interiority ("knew better," "knew the truth"). Several stock metaphors: "pulse through veins like blood," "ripple outward, unstoppable as dawn," "consumed an empire." These patterns dull momentum in the middle third and touch the closure image ("quiet fire" is serviceable but generic). Apply baseline −0.6 for template runs and stock phrasing, with an additional −0.3 for touching closure. No egregious clarity breaks, but propulsion sags under repeated stems.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with strong opening and closing images. Information density is generally high. Several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("she saw herself three heartbeats forward" / "The precognitive flash struck: she saw herself three heartbeats forward"), conceptual redundancy in the middle third explaining what the eels "really are" and what precognition means, and filter-verb stacks ("She saw... She saw... She understood now"). The exposition block explaining the frictionless world's true nature reads as scaffold that slows momentum. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]... She [verb]" patterns during key beats. Artifacts touch but don't obscure closure; routing −0.8 here per Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Lightning struck the rod above, sending electricity crackling through the dome's metal frame. Maya remained furiously tranquil" delivers setting, action, and character state). Rhythm varies purposefully. Two issues lower the score: (1) Minor paraphrase loop—"Each deletion had taught her the exact shape of what couldn't be said, and therefore, paradoxically, how to say it" restates the prior paragraph's "scars fascinated her more than the original words" without added pressure. (2) Stock metaphor: "silver veins across the cloudscape" and "electric kiss" are serviceable but not fresh. Clarity remains high; no scaffolding or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("brook that whispered," "trails of light"). However, multiple scaffold patterns accumulate: "The mechanical arm [verb]" opens three beats; "understood/understanding" and "revolution/resistance" cycle without added meaning; "hidden overture" and "secret negotiation disguised" paraphrase in adjacent lines. The phrase "diplomatic fierce" modulates to "diplomatically fierce" mid-story without motivation. "Dignified chaos" appears twice, once as tone descriptor and once as thematic claim, suggesting synonym management. The closure paragraph stacks three scaffold constructions ("promise: that questions... destinations, and that... chaos, truth") that dilute rather than propel the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high in the backstory passages, but the present-scene beats loop: "lifted another torn page," "pressed another page into her growing manuscript," "touched the coffee tin once more" recycle similar actions without propulsion. Sentence openings vary, and no major grammar or tense errors appear. Figurative language is controlled ("liquid silver," "luminous fractures") and apt for the tone, though density in some lines ("Each personality was perfectly crafted for its purpose, a tool in her larger work") trends explanatory. The paraphrase loop around the anthology-building (Neruda/Rumi/Dickinson fragments described similarly across paragraphs) and the restatement of October's method in the penultimate paragraph trigger a −0.6 deduction in Q7 for scaffold and momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence variety and rhythm are strong; no template cadence runs. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character state, or plot. However, two paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "The compasses throughout the terminal began pointing toward the screen" followed immediately by repetition of compass steadiness; and the penultimate paragraph ("her steely longing hadn't been about...") restates thematically what the prior image already conveyed. Stock metaphors appear occasionally ("horizon prepared its nightly invitation to darkness"), and one instance of register drift ("dwelling in between frames" edges toward academic phrasing for Sophia's two-year absence). Proofreading is clean, and spatial choreography tracks clearly. The opening and closing images are vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is abundant ("translucent as forgotten names," "heavier than grief"), but density tips toward overwriting in non-peak beats—multiple metaphors per sentence without all earning their space. The closing paragraph stacks three rhetorical questions and summary statements that loop thematically rather than propel. Minor paraphrase: "empirically whimsical warmth—measurable yet inexplicable" restates the same idea. No major template cadence or grammar breaks, but information density dips in the final third where telling replaces image. Filter-verb use is light and purposeful. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and the opening/closing images anchor voice and stakes. Figurative language is dense—"silence stretch like morning mist," "roots remember everything the tree forgets," "thoughts scattered by grief"—and mostly cohesive, though the cerulean passage mixes color, anatomy, and emotional state into near-opacity. Two paraphrase loops: "the pattern his grandmother called 'the tide's return'" followed immediately by "reading his grandmother's hidden message" repeats the lace-decoding concept; "the sea churned with its eternal rhythm, bringing things to shore and taking them away" summarizes what the tides metaphor already established. No major scaffold or template cadence, but density of metaphor in consecutive lines occasionally slows momentum.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, fluent, and generally economical, with many sentences doing double duty for image and idea (“how to preprocess reality without mathematics as an intermediary” is both character insight and thematic statement). Recurrent motifs (collapse, dust, patterns) are woven in without obvious syntactic templating or loops, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. At times, abstraction and near-repetitions of the thesis edge toward over-explanation, slightly flattening momentum in the last third. Still, line-level clarity and information density remain high, and no figurative muddle harms closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally elegant, with varied sentence structure, dense but clear imagery, and good integration of description, backstory, and thought. Lines often do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and theme (e.g., frost patterns as both physical detail and metaphor for adaptive transformation). There are a few slightly redundant or abstract phrasings that could be tightened (“purpose in this pause,” “space between her former life and her transformation”), and the metaphor density flirts with saturation in places, but it doesn’t tip into muddle. Information flow and rhythm maintain momentum for this reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, often doing double duty for image and emotion, and metaphors like “crystallized breath” and “prismatic symphonies” feel purposeful rather than ornamental. There’s good rhythmic variation and minimal scaffolding or repetition; each paragraph advances either the science, the grief, or the emerging music. A few lines lean toward overt summarization (“She was creating a new form of notation,” “The world needed to know...”), which slightly blunts the otherwise immersive showing. Overall, this is close to publishable prose with only minor tightening needed to avoid explanatory notes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled: “bubble of breathable grief,” “bodies of knowledge,” “mausoleums from coral and memory” each do multiple jobs without stacking into muddle. There’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn; most sentences advance image, world, and theme simultaneously. The only check on a higher score is that figurative language is nearly continuous, and while it remains clear here, the edge toward lushness could begin to crowd sharper scene-movement in a longer piece.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-driven (“benevolent shadows,” “silent marketplace of dignity”) with strong information density and minimal scaffolding. Sentences generally do double duty—advancing both action and atmosphere—and there’s little redundancy or clotted metaphor. Occasional abstract or aphoristic lines flatten texture slightly compared with the more vivid, scene-grounded passages. Line-level control is strong enough for elite venues, though not quite so singular or risk-taking as the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character interiority simultaneously). Rhythm is varied and mostly avoids scaffolding or repetition; the metaphors (prayer written in stone, door of compressed starlight and forgotten promises) are striking and coherent. There is a mild tendency toward density—several clauses stacked with figurative language—that risks purple in places but rarely tips into genuine muddle. Overall clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally concise despite their lyricism, and most metaphors are coherent and mutually reinforcing (time as granular, gardens as memory, bridges as temporal paths). There is some density of figurative language and repeated abstract phrasing around “texture of time” that edges toward overload but doesn’t quite tip into muddle. Information density is high, with few true scaffolding lines, and the final image lands clearly. Small trims to repetitious conceptual statements would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: clear syntax, good information density, and efficient integration of world-building into action (“Each teddy bear's belly held heritage grains; every snow globe contained dormant legumes”). There are some slightly purple or sloganic formulations (“patient rebellion,” “weight of ten thousand possible futures”) that tip into abstraction, but they don’t obscure sense. Momentum rarely stalls; exposition is compact and purposeful. No evident scaffolding loops or major metaphor mishaps appear, and the final image is concrete enough to carry thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple layers of work (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy, and figurative language is generally fresh and coherent (“roots releasing soil,” “hull splitting like overripe fruit”). Rhythm varies well, and there are no significant scaffolding phrases or paraphrase loops dulling momentum. The density of metaphor is high, but it seldom tips into blur or self-contradiction, and the prose remains clear through the climax. Small trims could make a few passages even tighter, yet nothing meaningfully obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally elegant, with vivid images like “emerald-tiled walls…gleamed like scales” and the moonbeams as “silver threads” doing double duty for worldbuilding and tone. Sentences vary in length and structure, and most lines carry more than one function (setting, character, and theme at once). There is a mild tendency toward explanatory or slightly purple phrasing and some repeated thematic language (“golden hour,” “light,” “beautiful”) that could be tightened for maximum impact. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closing image is clean and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished and musical, with varied syntax and a good balance of image and action; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Recurring metaphors around heat, ice, and dust are coherent rather than muddled, and there is little in the way of scaffolding or redundant phrasing. At times the prose leans toward the ornate, with frequent figurative turns that border on purple but mostly remain controlled and purposeful. Momentum is maintained despite the lyricism, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is clean, largely free of redundancy, and maintains momentum; most sentences do double duty in establishing mood and advancing stakes. Imagery (“stars pierced through the collapsed roof sections,” “years of stellar dust”) is vivid without tipping into full purple prose. Expository patches are concise enough not to bog the scene, and there are no significant syntactic or logical slips. A slight tendency toward high-density metaphor in places could be moderated, but it does not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character) and the rhythm flows without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphoric density is high but mostly precise and thematically aligned with stone, silence, and starlight; it rarely muddies sense. Some phrases and constructs recur (e.g., “ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” reiterations of her booklet and maps) in ways that flirt with purple repetition rather than fresh deepening. For an elite venue, a light tightening of redundancy and occasional over-ornamentation would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally concise, with strong images and minimal redundancy; sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding + theme + mood) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and the closing image of the violin sublimating while Seven mops is clean and effective. A few abstract formulations (“transformation through patient accumulation,” “tidying up the chaos of existence by observing it”) are blunter and more expository than the surrounding lines, but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Line-level control is solid enough for publication with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and a high density of lines that do double duty for atmosphere and character. Images like “puddles a mirror to questions Mira had stopped asking aloud” and the forecourt turning breath into music are vivid without becoming convoluted. There is occasional abstraction or mild purple (“transparency had a way of demanding its due,” “elaborate architectures of protection”) that could be pared for even greater immediacy, but they don’t materially slow momentum or obscure sense. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts appear, and the final image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Lines like “a smile both blooming and withering” and “fruit ripening toward rot” are vivid without tipping into incoherence. There’s minor lushness, but it’s largely in service of tone rather than gratuitous ornament. No notable loops or scaffolding artifacts slow momentum or blur meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally well-paced; most sentences carry both worldbuilding and mood without obvious scaffolding or loops. Some metaphors and paradoxes are effective, though a few (“mechanically warm efficiency,” repeated “icy warmth”) begin to feel like motifs verging on tics rather than deepening each time. Expository phrases (“holographic principles,” “temporal vectors”) occasionally read as abstract labels rather than sensuous images, which mutes impact slightly. Still, there are no major artifacts, and line-level clarity and rhythm meet a solid professional standard.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich, and purposeful: almost every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or the central conceit. Metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s materials (water, music, reflection) without stacking into purple excess, and there’s little to no scaffold or synonym-churn. Rhythm supports mood—longer, flowing sentences for reflection, shorter for the climactic act of holding the note. One could trim a handful of slightly redundant explanatory lines, but line-level craft is strong and never obscures clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Metaphors (e.g., “like grief made visible,” “a second, wiser heart”) are fresh and coherent, rarely feeling strained. There is a mild tendency toward lushness and abstract phrasing in a few spots, but it doesn’t obscure sense or slow momentum meaningfully. No notable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony undermine the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences do double or triple duty in advancing atmosphere, character, and theme without noticeable scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors (“lined the walls like metal tombstones,” beads like “DNA strands”) are coherent and apt. Syntax varies nicely, and paragraphing creates a smooth rhythm down and back up the tunnel. A handful of lines land in familiar territory (“where the living world was just beginning to stir”), limiting the very top of the band, but there are no significant artifacts or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely meaningful, and usually do multiple jobs (image, theme, mood) without obvious scaffolding. Metaphors remain coherent and on-theme, avoiding mixed or strained imagery even at high density. There is some repetition of concepts (“crumbling peace,” decomposing knowledge) that edges toward overstatement but doesn’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready, if a bit luxuriant.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, good rhythm, and generally high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery like “traveling through root systems… creating an underground symphony” effectively fuses motif and setting without collapsing clarity. There is some mild redundancy and a few abstract, thesis-like lines that could be tightened, but no serious loops, mixed metaphors, or momentum-killing purple patches. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with minor trims.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphorical language is mostly precise (“spines that remembered being trees,” “half-burned diaries…like broken birds”), and there’s good information density. The prose sustains atmosphere while advancing concept and character, with few true redundancies. However, the figurative texture verges on saturated in places, and a couple of abstractions (“fundamental sliding of reality’s centerline”) blunt immediacy. It’s publishable-level prose with slight restraint needed to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and key images (the beam’s rhythm, fortunes as measures, “composer becomes his own music”) are clear and resonant. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases, and momentum holds despite reflective passages. A slight tendency toward repeated abstract phrasing (“open secrets,” “orchestrating”) is noticeable but not enough to dull clarity or cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is polished, with high information density and metaphors that are mostly clean and mutually reinforcing (sound as architecture, silence as decoration, doubt as indigo). Repetition (loops, stillness) is purposeful rather than scaffolding, and there’s little obvious synonym churn or filler. While the prose edges toward purple in places, rhythm and clarity are preserved; images rarely become muddled. A touch more restraint in explicit abstraction could push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that are largely apt and reinforcing (spirals, reflections, music). There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. The figurative load is high but generally disciplined; only occasionally does the density edge toward purple without tipping into confusion. The closing cadence is especially well tuned.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean yet evocative, with most doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, psychology, and atmosphere) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; the rain, light, and bridge metaphors cohere around a single image system rather than veering into mixed metaphors. There’s little scaffold or synonym looping, and the prose maintains momentum through complex ideas. A few phrases (“labyrinth of self,” “quantum foam”) feel slightly stock or abstract compared to the most concrete images, but they don’t materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: rich images (“each note arriving before its own birth,” “filament of hush”) do more than one job and feel anchored in the physical situation. Sentences vary in length and structure, maintaining momentum despite the reflective mode, and there’s little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping. At times, figurative density in the final third edges toward purple and explanatory (“mirrored hush,” “backward recorded song playing endlessly beneath her feet”) and a few abstractions are repeated in slightly different wording, which slightly dulls the sharpness. Overall, though, clarity remains high and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, economical, and vivid; most sentences do multiple jobs (characterization, world-building, and atmosphere at once). There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the figurative language is restrained and coherent. The closing paragraph in particular lands with good rhythm and a clear, charged image. It’s not formally dazzling or stylistically daring, but it’s polished to a level compatible with high-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme) with good rhythm and minimal scaffolding. Imagery is rich but generally coherent, and repetition (extinction, light, scent, tears) mostly functions as motif rather than loop. There is minor over-explication at the thematic level, where a few sentences restate insights the images already convey. The prose maintains clarity and momentum throughout, with no artifacts that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, clean mechanics, and high information density—most sentences do double duty for setting, character, and theme. Metaphors are generally coherent and anchored (rope/texture/time), and repetitions of “texture,” “impossible choices,” and “weight” read as motif rather than careless looping, though they approach overuse. Momentum holds well for a reflective piece; there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn, and the images are legible. The main constraint on a higher score is a mild tendency toward abstract summarizing in the final paragraph rather than leaving more work to the images.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, sensuous, and purposeful, with images like “shipwrecks ringed the greenhouse like broken teeth” doing multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler transitions. Rhythm adapts well to the accumulating music, and the final lines land cleanly without syntactic clutter. A touch more compression in thematic statements could sharpen impact further, but overall the prose is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong images, good rhythm, and efficient integration of worldbuilding into sentence-level texture. Occasional repetitions (“The transformation was beginning now…” / “The transformation was nearly complete now…”) and explanatory lines in the final paragraph slightly blunt momentum. A few abstractions (“professionally thorough,” “deeper patterns”) could be grounded more concretely at peak beats. Overall, density and clarity are high, with only minor drift toward exposition and faint purple notes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and information-dense, with good variation in rhythm and no major clarity issues. Images like “tears fell like rain on calm water” and “pages’ whispers like symphony notes across the water” are conventional but controlled, and figurative language isn’t so stacked that it muddies sense. There’s mild redundancy in the closing moral formulations and a few abstractions (“eternal exchange,” “currencies beyond her careful calculations”) that could be tightened. Overall, however, the line-level work supports momentum and mood without obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is graceful and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“luminescent ache of belonging finally found”) occasionally leans purple but generally remains coherent and aligned with the story’s aesthetic. Rhythm varies nicely between lush description and brisker summary; syntax is clear and grammatical throughout. Some metaphors and abstractions in the final paragraph could be pared slightly for sharper impact, but they do not materially blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, largely free of scaffolding, and information-dense, often accomplishing worldbuilding, mood, and motion in the same sentence (“water flowing impossibly upward between the towers, defying gravity through ancient engineering”). Figurative language is generally apt and not over-stacked; only occasional lines flirt with abstraction, but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing support a feeling of continuous forward drive from studio to canals to chamber and back.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid images like “bioluminescent fungi, each ring a calculation of what was versus what remained” do multiple jobs at once, and line-level rhythm supports the contemplative pace. There are very few redundancies or scaffolding sentences; information density is high and momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. Some phrases (“mathematics of emotion,” “presence and absence”) recur in abstract form often enough to feel slightly didactic, but they don’t seriously muddy clarity or closure. Figurative language remains coherent and grounded in the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and mood. Figurative language (“constellation of memory,” “sapphire hush of dawn”) is vivid and mostly well-judged, stopping short of purple excess and avoiding mixed metaphors. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or repetitive sentence stems; momentum is maintained despite the quiet stakes. Minor elevated phrases are in character for the reflective, archivist-adjacent lens, so they don’t jar.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with strong verbs, concrete imagery, and minimal scaffolding; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Figurative language is generally controlled and apt (“like watercolor on wet paper”), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. A few lines articulate theme a bit directly, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image. Rhythm and paragraphing support a smooth escalation toward the final, charged moment under the trellis.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Imagery like “the Atlantic pulled back its skirts” and “liquified time” is vivid and largely coherent, with little redundancy or scaffold. There is some accumulation of figurative language in early paragraphs that flirts with purple but doesn’t obscure sense or momentum. A stricter pruning of a few abstract phrases in the closing lines could heighten the impact of the already-strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, syntactically clean, and often do double duty for mood and information. The figurative language (threads of futures, sugar in rain, music between sound and silence) is mostly fresh and coherent, with few mixed metaphors. There is some redundancy and abstraction in the closing paragraphs—repeated formulations about “magic,” “every moment,” and “bright darkness”—that slightly blunts impact. Overall momentum and clarity remain intact, with only mild flirtation with purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language (“salt crystals clung…like memories,” “absence has its own grammar”) is mostly fresh and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances character or concept. A slight tendency toward abstraction in a few spots is the only thing keeping it from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong images and efficient worldbuilding woven into movement. Sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain flow, and most lines carry more than one function (world, mood, and character). There is a mild tendency toward purple/aphoristic phrasing and a few near-redundant assertions of theme, but they don’t significantly bog momentum or clarity. Line-level control is solidly publication-ready, if not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong information density: details almost always pull double duty for atmosphere and theme (“transcribed stellar movements into mathematical proofs,” “some truths require sculpting absence”). Rhythm and syntax are varied, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. The main limitation is occasional drift into slightly generalized or slogan-like abstractions that could be rendered more concretely; they don’t break clarity but slightly soften impact. There are no significant line-level artifacts or muddle affecting the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally sharp, with good information density and few wasted sentences; description usually advances both mood and plot. Some metaphors are lush but not overstacked, and they mostly cohere with the speculative imagery; the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There are occasional slightly purple touches and familiar constructions (“whispering promises of dimensional rifts,” “voice…like hushed thunder”), but they don’t bog down momentum or blur clarity. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts interfere with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and purposeful, with strong images like “deathly vitality” and the ink pot “heavier now with truth” doing thematic and atmospheric work simultaneously. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffold or redundancy; most lines advance more than one layer (plot, character, or theme). The repeated math metaphor nudges toward over-insistence but stops short of feeling gimmicky. No significant figurative muddle or syntactic clutter interferes with clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and cadence, images are mostly clean, and information density is high without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Some metaphors are lush, but they remain coherent and support the atmosphere rather than tipping into purple excess. Prose momentum fits the accumulative, lyric mode—unhurried but not static, with each paragraph adding a new facet to method, setting, or theme. There are no noticeable grammatical or clarity issues, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but precise, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding and theme, or image and emotion) without slipping into purple or muddled metaphor. Rhythm varies well between longer, flowing descriptions and shorter, more declarative insights, keeping momentum in a reflective piece. Repetition is purposeful (tides, containers, annotations) rather than looping or scaffolding, and there are no significant line-level artifacts or clarity drops. A few formulations could be pared slightly for sharper impact, but overall the line craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and images that are both concrete and apt (“broken crown,” papers “like dying moths,” the note hanging longer than physics allows). Sentences vary in length and structure, sustaining momentum without feeling breathless or cluttered. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding lines. Aside from a couple of slightly expository statements of theme, the line-level work would be competitive in a strong literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is tight, polished, and rhythmically varied, with a high density of lines doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, character, and thematic charge—without obvious loops or scaffolding. Figurative language (“carnival lights reflecting off black water like scattered prayers”) is vivid and generally well-placed, rarely feeling overwrought. Information flow is clear and momentum-relevant; backstory is efficiently tied to present action via the stone chip and education details. A few sentences lean toward summary exposition over dramatization, but they do not measurably dull the closure or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, and theme) with minimal redundancy, and rhythm is pleasingly varied. Imagery (“Earth hung pregnant and blue,” “vapor emerged like a ghost’s breath”) is vivid without tipping into muddled metaphor, and syntax remains clear. There’s a slight tendency toward high-density figurative language in reflective moments, but it doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image. No notable loops, scaffolding, or mechanical artifacts interfere with momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: vivid images, efficient exposition, and a clear progression through the repair process. Figurative language (“canvas of perception,” “tiny vortexes in the mist”) is mostly apt and not overstacked. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances either atmosphere, character, or plot. A few phrases stray toward the generic or slightly purple, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly controlled: images like the “cataract eye” lake and dendritic condensation pattern are vivid without veering into purple. Nearly every line does double duty, advancing atmosphere and character while carrying information. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or strained metaphors, and rhythm shifts gracefully between description, thought, and dialogue. The final sentence in particular is precise and earned, recharging prior motifs without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, and most do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and idea. Sound-related imagery (“tone hung in the air like a promise,” “wild hush”) is precise and not overstuffed, and there’s minimal redundancy. There are a few slightly expository phrases, but no major loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors. The final paragraph in particular lands with clean, uncluttered rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is controlled and dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and internal state—without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. Metaphors are largely consistent with the underwater, memory-preservation frame (amber, threads, gathered hush) and rarely feel strained. There is some abstract summary (“The temple had been built to harness the ephemeral”) that could be sharpened into more scene-anchored imagery, and the final explanatory sentence slightly over-tells. Overall, though, rhythm and clarity hold under pressure, supporting momentum through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lean for its level of imagery, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information (“threading his way into the corridor like smoke through a keyhole”). Figurative language is controlled and thematically linked (labyrinth, lattice, hush, copper light) rather than scattered. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the paragraphs turn on new information or escalation rather than rephrasing. A few lines flirt with purple, but they don’t obscure clarity or blunt the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with images that usually do double duty for mood and worldbuilding (“luminescent fruits pulsed like hearts,” “fields outside cracked like broken promises”). Line-level clarity is strong; events and emotional turns are easy to follow. There is occasional purple saturation—multiple metaphors per paragraph, with some leaning on familiar emotional constructions—that slightly risks over-ornamentation. Still, momentum rarely stalls, and the closing paragraphs land with clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“barnacles grew on petroglyphs,” “threads that wouldn't exist until tomorrow into fabric that had unraveled yesterday”). Rhythm varies well, and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-echo. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful; only a few spots border on purple or explanatory (e.g., restating the miracle as “not restoration, but transformation”), slightly softening the line-level bite. Overall, momentum and clarity are preserved despite the density.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are well-shaped, with varied syntax and high information density—most lines do double duty in atmosphere and theme. Imagery is precise and evocative (“roots embracing skulls and femurs,” “pomegranates splitting against marble angels”) with only minor risk of overstatement. A few thematic lines verge on abstraction or repetition, but there’s no real scaffolding, synonym churn, or figurative muddle that dulls closure. Line-level craft is solidly above-average and largely submission-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, economical, and often do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus character). Figurative language—“memories of a future that never quite arrived,” chalk as “constellation”—is vivid but not overstacked, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffold. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and paragraphing supports momentum despite the reflective mode. The only modest limitation is that the prose rarely shifts tempo or texture to mark an internal turn, keeping everything in roughly the same lyrical key.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“bruise against the sky,” “echoed silence between words”) and good information density—most sentences advance both world and character. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and action sequencing is clear. The main limitation is that some metaphors (e.g., “adjacent possibilities”) sit at a higher conceptual register than the surrounding texture and could feel slightly abstract compared to the otherwise concrete line work.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean yet evocative, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and emotion. There is some density of metaphor (“roots twisted like frozen screams,” “space where an apology waits unspoken,” “moonlight mending broken things”), but they are coherent and not obviously mixed. Redundancy is minimal and transitions are smooth; the prose keeps moving the scene forward. Occasionally, diction leans toward the sentimental or abstract, slightly softening impact, but not enough to harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “shared anxieties hanging in the humid air like unspoken prayers” and the coral as “map of neural pathways” are vivid and multi-functional. The prose largely avoids redundancy and keeps momentum even while being lush. There is a mild tendency toward density of metaphor in a few sentences, but it stops short of purple and does not blur clarity or closure. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with good information density and minimal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and generally efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for image and emotion (“their techniques flooded through her consciousness like exposed film developing in reverse”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful rather than gratuitously ornate, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and the final lines land with a clear, charged image. Minor tendencies toward purple abstraction in places don’t significantly obscure sense or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally avoid redundancy, with most imagery doing double duty for mood and concept (e.g., questions fracturing into harmonics, time crystallizing in the pause). The figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts that drag momentum. A few phrases edge toward the ornate, yet clarity remains intact, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“The greenhouse hummed with ten thousand wings…” is a strong, efficient opener). Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and there’s little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or repetition. The prose occasionally leans into elevated phrasing (“photosynthetic rebellion,” “converging chaos”) that flirts with slogan, but it doesn’t obstruct clarity or momentum. With just a touch more austerity around those high-register coinages, this would edge into truly exceptional line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple layers of work (world, theme, emotion) with good rhythm and few redundancies. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and purposeful, and the repeated spiral/pain-into-light motif feels patterned rather than purple. There are occasional near-overwritten stretches and explicit lesson-sentences that lightly drag momentum, but no serious artifacts or clarity issues. The final paragraph lands cleanly with a resonant, well-shaped image.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clear causal sequencing, and high information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically aligned (orchids, light, clouds, extinction of sensations). There are no significant loops or redundancies, and rhythm supports the calm urgency of the scene. The lushness does flirt with purple in a few phrases, yet never enough to obscure sense or dull the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished and image-rich, with effective metaphors like “symmetries of truth” and “crystallizing like frost patterns on winter glass” that feel thematically apt. Line-level clarity is strong; sentences pull their weight and maintain momentum without obvious scaffolding or loops. There is mild risk of purple or repetitive diction (promises, symphonies, truth) and some summarizing lines that tell what’s already implied. These are minor rather than structural issues, keeping the piece comfortably above-average but shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and images that usually do more than one job (e.g., “stone lungs” immediately fuses architecture, geology, and theme). Sentences are well-shaped, avoiding obvious scaffolding or loops, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, resonant cadence. There is a fair amount of figurative language, but it’s controlled and coherent rather than purple; the metaphor of breathing architecture and flowing water is carried consistently. Slight over-insistence on a few motifs/phrases is the only minor drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and musical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character—e.g., “her fingers learning to trust paper that wouldn't betray her” elegantly fuses image and psychology. Metaphor use is frequent but controlled and coherent (dust motes as constellations/flight paths, meteorite as talismanic debris), avoiding mixed images or purple excess. There’s little to no scaffolding or redundant looping; each paragraph advances the emotional movement. A marginal tightening of a few adjectival clusters could push this toward truly exceptional, but the line-level craft already reads at a high literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding, and there’s little redundancy or synonym-churn. Metaphors (grain as wind history, maze as weather map, pressure differential as holiness) are coherent and sustained rather than mixed. The prose flirts with purple in places but generally stays controlled, and momentum is maintained despite the density of imagery. No significant artifacts or loops blunt the closure image; the final paragraphs land cleanly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is vivid and generally economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“stone breathed and coral grew in perfect spirals that matched galactic arms”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and coherent; it rarely descends into muddle or cliché. There are a few spots of mild purple or abstraction in the final paragraph, but they do not significantly blunt the closure image. Information flows clearly, without noticeable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and largely fresh figurative language (“Joy that tasted purple. Sorrow that hummed at precisely middle C.”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once. There is some risk of metaphor stacking, but images stay coherent and rarely feel redundant or muddled. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece; no significant scaffolding or loops drag the line-level experience.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, economical, and often do double duty—advancing action while deepening character or atmosphere. Imagery such as “stars pricked through the marine layer like pinholes in black velvet” and “foam fingers reaching” is vivid but not overwhelmingly stacked. There’s little in the way of redundancy or scaffolding; the prose keeps moving without looping concepts. A slight tendency toward polished, thematically tidy phrasing in places keeps it from feeling fully effortless, but it remains very solid.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, theme, character) with good rhythm and clarity. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, and key beats (dust multiplying, garden holding her imprint) land cleanly. There is mild purple-prose pressure and some repetition of favored constructions (e.g., “obsidian grace,” “cosmic verse”), which slightly reduce sharpness. Even so, there are no serious loops or artifacts that impede momentum or understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong image choices (“darkness still clung to the water like oil,” “each droplet a tiny lens”) and good information density—most sentences do multiple jobs for setting, character, and theme. Rhythm varies well, and the repeated motifs of rings, prisms, and boundaries accumulate instead of looping aimlessly. The main weakness is a slight drift into abstraction and explanatory phrasing near the end, where lines start telling the lesson the images have already earned. Overall, there are no major artifacts or redundancies, and clarity and momentum are well-maintained for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and economical, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“each crack mapping a different heartbreak, each fracture sealed with gold in the Japanese way”). Rhythm and sentence variety support the contemplative pacing, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few metaphors verge on the purple or are reiterated in slightly different abstract terms (destruction/creation, hard/soft grief) but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication with minimal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, image-rich, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. Metaphors (e.g., reality reorganizing like sand after a wave) are apt and thematically aligned, and technical terms (amplitude, quantum signature) serve both character and worldbuilding. There is some leaning into abstraction and conceptual phrasing, but it stays legible and doesn’t blur causality or the closure image. The prose supports mood and structure with minimal artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful information; most sentences carry both atmosphere and character or world-building work. Imagery like “labyrinth of green corridors” and “their pages brown and brittle as autumn leaves” feels apt rather than purple. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal, and the narrative moves forward without looping or bogging in exposition. A few theme statements verge on the abstract, but they do not materially dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, grammatically clean, and often do double duty in advancing mood and stakes (“The hush stretched like taffy, sweet and golden”). Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; images of light, echo, and rain interlock rather than clash. The piece mostly avoids scaffolding and repetition, keeping momentum through a steady accretion of charged detail. Some phrases verge on ornamental, yet they do not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“a constellation of almost-peace,” “moving like grief itself,” “broken music”) that do multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies well, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but generally controlled; metaphors align and avoid muddle. There are no noticeable grammatical issues or loops that drag momentum, and the final sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, with most doing double duty (worldbuilding plus character, or image plus theme). Figurative language is inventive yet coherent with the world (cracks as maps, songs fossilized in sediment), and the piece avoids redundancy and scaffolding. The rhythm carries momentum even through reflective passages, and clarity never suffers despite conceptual ambition. A few lines edge toward overtly “crafted” phrasing, but they don’t tip into purple or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is lush and generally precise, with metaphors that are both imagistic and conceptually apt (threads as crystallized longings, body as living poem). Sentences carry multiple functions—worldbuilding, theme, and action—without much redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. There is a mild tendency toward density and abstraction in a few lines, risking purple prose but not tipping into confusion. Overall clarity and propulsion are preserved, particularly around the sanctuary’s opening and the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“translating echoes into meaning,” “those moments when understanding hovers just beyond full comprehension”). Metaphors largely cohere around light, echo, and narrative recursion, giving the piece a unified texture. There are moments of conceptual redundancy and near-purple density where abstraction piles up and slackens momentum. Still, clarity holds, and the line-level craft is above-average for competitive submissions.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied structures, high information density, and figurative language that generally earns its place and clarifies rather than obscures. There are a few moments of near-purple concentration (e.g., droplets as “prisms that hung like unfinished sentences”) but they remain coherent and on-theme, not muddled. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony drag momentum. The prose could be fractionally tightened for maximum sharpness, but it’s already at an advanced, publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong image work (“releasing names like smoke,” “snowmelt running down like tears of relief”) and good information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and idea. Rhythm varies naturally, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding, synonym churn, or clunky exposition. Some metaphors and abstract summaries of theme edge toward the purple or didactic, but they remain coherent and do not obscure action or causality. The final paragraph in particular balances image and statement effectively enough to sustain momentum into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, image-rich, and efficient; most sentences do double duty for mood and information (“its letters bleeding rust down the walls like tears of iron” is emblematic). Rhythm and paragraphing create good momentum for a largely contemplative piece. There is slight over-reliance on high-flown metaphors and aphorisms in the final third, which risks purple territory and softens impact, but clarity and propulsion remain intact. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts appear.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and motion) with relatively little scaffolding or redundancy, and images like “starlight filtered through calculated gaps in the crumbling ceiling” are precise and apt. A few phrases and constructions recur (“empirically ironic,” “devotion…understanding,” “covenant”) in a slightly heavy-handed way, but they don’t obscure clarity. Figurative language is dense yet mostly controlled, and the final paragraphs maintain momentum rather than dissolving into abstraction. Overall, the prose is near-ready for elite publication with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong images like “reality bent like water around stones” and “rage filled the soundless space like smoke” that carry both atmosphere and theme. Information density is high; many sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and emotional framing without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“cellular memory,” “resentment,” “broken things”) but it reads as motif rather than padding. A few lines verge on purple or aphoristic, yet clarity and momentum never seriously suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is clear, rhythmic, and efficient; most sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and story. Figurative language (fog as prisms, trees as pillars holding galaxies) is vivid and coherent with the mirror/star motif without slipping into muddled metaphor. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or template cadence; the piece reads smoothly aloud. A few phrases verge on the ornamental, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally concise yet evocative, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“There were no accidents in a mender’s life, only patterns waiting to reveal themselves”). Rhythm varies naturally, description is selective rather than list-like, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Some lines verge on purple or aphoristic, especially near the ending, and the “no accidents” idea is reiterated in slightly similar terms. Still, clarity and momentum remain high, and figurative language is mostly coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong, specific imagery (“blossoms fell upward,” “juice ran silver down her chin like liquid starlight”) and generally high information density. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly every line advances either atmosphere, concept, or character. There is some risk of metaphor stacking verging on purple in the last paragraph (“tasted like memory, like prophecy, like the precise flavor of temporal paradox”), but it remains coherent rather than muddled. I see no scaffolding loops or clarity issues that materially harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or image plus theme). Figurative language—“chambers of an ancient heart,” “condensed starlight,” “music of possibility and redemption”—is mostly coherent and tonally apt, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few phrases verge on purple or conceptually redundant (e.g., reiterating the library’s purpose in similar terms), slightly dulling momentum. Still, line-level craft is comfortably publication-grade and supports rather than obscures the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors (“face… viewed through disturbed water,” “waves peeled into tentacles of canvas”) are vivid and coherent, enhancing rather than obscuring sense. The prose sustains a rich descriptive register without tipping into purple or bogging momentum, and there are no notable loops or mechanical artifacts. Rhythm supports the story’s slow-blooming pressure and the closure image is crisp and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors (e.g., documents existing “only in their absence”) are apt and coherent rather than showy for their own sake. Exposition about treaties and vanished places is compressed efficiently into vivid images, maintaining momentum. The prose approaches but does not cross into purple; it keeps clarity even when ideas become abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and metaphorical language that remains coherent and grounded in the story’s sensory logic. Sentences regularly do double duty—advancing action while deepening atmosphere or theme—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm modulates well between dense description and quieter, summarizing closure. The density of imagery borders on lush but stops short of purple, maintaining momentum and clarity through the climax and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is rich but mostly controlled, with multi-tasking sentences that carry setting, concept, and emotion simultaneously. Figurative language (anti-light, shadows that fall upward, hush as honey) is mostly coherent and thematically aligned, not random ornament, and there’s little obvious scaffold or repetition. Density does flirt with purple in a few patches, yet clarity and momentum are maintained through the climb and activation sequence. The final paragraphs land with strong cadence and avoid syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and purposeful, with most lines doing double duty for setting and theme. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler scaffolds. The prose sustains momentum in a contemplative mode without getting bogged down. A slight tendency toward repetitive abstract nouns (“experiences,” “memories,” “moment”) keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and carry multiple functions (world-building, emotion, and motion) without obvious padding. Figurative language (“gravity of hopelessness,” “fortress walls bloomed”) is apt and not overstacked, and there are no major mixed metaphors or cadence loops. The prose sustains momentum through the instructional middle without bogging in technical detail. Minor repetitions and slightly familiar constructions appear but do not materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, imagery is vivid yet mostly economical, and there’s little paraphrase or scaffolding. Many lines do double duty, advancing both scene and theme (e.g., the sea star simultaneously regenerating and consuming). There is a high density of figurative language, but it’s coherent and pattern-consistent rather than purple or muddled, and momentum never fully stalls. Minor trims could heighten compression further, yet as-is the prose would not embarrass an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences accomplish multiple tasks (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme) without feeling overstuffed. Figurative language is vivid and coherent; metaphors extend and echo rather than clash, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn. Minor redundancies appear in thematically declarative lines, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure events. Overall, rhythm and clarity hold even in the more baroque descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong images (“acoustic pockets,” “echoes of thoughts never spoken”) and efficient worldbuilding woven into action. Sentences generally do multiple jobs—advancing setting, mood, and character simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few phrases lean toward aphoristic or branded (“presence without intrusion,” “architecture of silence”), which slightly cheapens otherwise fine-grained texture. Overall momentum remains smooth and clear, and figurative language rarely muddies sense.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with vivid phrases (“kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “smart-paint surface flickering… like a glitching memory”) doing multiple jobs. Most sentences advance either world-building or thematic resonance without obvious scaffold or repetition. Some lines verge on purple or expository (“the wisely adventurous choice of pioneers who’d sailed into the dark rather than bend to tyranny”), where trimming could heighten impact. Still, clarity is maintained and the final image lands without being obscured by figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: imagery is often arresting ("burned with the rest, teaching herself that some entries must be destroyed to find exit") and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some repetition of concepts (suffocation, necessary endings, burning bridges) with similar phrasing, and a few sentences feel like paraphrased restatements rather than new pressure. The figurative density stays just shy of purple, though occasional abstract formulations ("careful devastation," "loaded emptiness") risk vagueness. Rhythm and clarity remain intact; there are no major artifacts or syntactic stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are often striking, and most lines carry more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language around pressure, light, and promises is recurrent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to clog momentum. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. A few aphoristic turns flatten complexity, but they don’t materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, and interiority often at once) with minimal redundancy, and the metaphoric language tends to be coherent and thematically linked (sepia, vinyl, waves, golden light). The cadence varies enough to prevent monotony, and there are no obvious scaffold phrases or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but generally purposeful, and it doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image. A touch more restraint in a few descriptions could sharpen impact even further, but the prose is already publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but mostly disciplined: images do double duty for worldbuilding and concept, and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym-churn. Sentences like “These were not mere plants but living equations, solving themselves endlessly” show information density and rhythmic control. At times the figurative stack (“shivering bliss,” “molten possibility,” “radiance of could-be”) edges toward over-saturation, which might prompt a line-trim in a top-tier venue. Still, clarity remains intact and momentum carries through the ritual without significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is strong line by line, with high information density and generally efficient sentences that do multiple jobs—atmosphere, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and patterned around dust, archives, and archaeology, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There is some conceptual repetition (variants of “some wounds require archaeology / a witness”) that could be tightened, but it doesn’t significantly stall momentum. Mechanics are clean, and the opening and closing images are both sharp and well-matched.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, with good rhythm and a judicious use of figurative language (“auric lagoon,” “mirror of possibilities”) that supports mood without devolving into purple excess. Sentences tend to carry multiple functions—worldbuilding, tone, and characterization—maintaining momentum and clarity. There are a few slogan-like or generic phrases (“carefully resourceful,” “anger without knowledge is just noise”) that feel more like thesis than lived perception. Overall, the line-level work is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed for maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, image-dense, and mostly avoids redundancy; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Figurative language (e.g., prophecy fragments re-forming “like mercury finding itself”) is fresh and legible rather than overwrought, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. A few phrases (“quietly vivid tableau,” “songs never born”) edge toward the ornate, but they remain coherent and purposeful rather than purple. There are no obvious scaffold loops or line-level errors, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level writing is polished, with strong rhythm, high information density, and generally precise metaphors; many sentences do double thematic and atmospheric duty. The prose occasionally verges on purple through cumulative flourish—stacked modifiers and frequent metaphors in close succession can create a slight sense of uniform lushness rather than modulation. There is minimal scaffolding or obvious repetition, and syntax remains clear even in complex images. A touch more spareness or variation at peak beats would lift momentum and impact to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is tight, economical, and often elegant, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information; there is little scaffolding or redundancy. Images are coherent and thematically linked (waterfall, rust, leaves, clocks) rather than scattered metaphors, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm lively. Occasional phrasing leans toward the expository or abstract (“temporal map that made no logical sense yet felt absolutely true”), but it does not significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image. Line-level control is strong enough for top-tier venues with only minor trimming needed.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images like “each drop catching the moonlight like liquid mercury” and the gold-filled cracks are vivid and purposeful. Sentences vary in rhythm, and most lines carry more than one function (setting, mood, and theme at once). There is some risk of purple prose and thematic repetition in the philosophical statements, but it stays just this side of overwrought and does not obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density—most sentences do at least two jobs of image, tone, or character. Figurative language is generally precise and thematically aligned, and there’s little in the way of paraphrase loops or scaffolding. The cadence from opening to final line reads intentional and controlled, supporting momentum through a largely introspective scene. A mild tendency toward sentiment in the closing beats (“another healing born from the marriage of sorrow and joy”) is tasteful but somewhat on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with high information density and some striking images (“drowning in reverse,” “landscape that belonged nowhere and everywhere simultaneously”). The mathematical/physical precision is nicely harnessed to character, though a few lines verge on purple or slightly redundant motif restatement (multiple formulations of “mathematics of X”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, sustaining momentum despite the introspective focus. The prose could benefit from a touch more spareness at peak beats, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and a good balance of image, action, and interiority; lines often do double duty advancing both worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language—“read the spaces between languages,” “pentimento shadows”—is apt and not overstacked. There’s little redundancy or scaffold, and syntax remains clear even in more abstract passages. The lyric register occasionally leans toward the ornate, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language (“dust motes spiral through the last shaft of evening light,” “weight like air”) is vivid yet controlled, rarely feeling purple or redundant. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity-breaking metaphors, and key beats (dust analysis, journals falling, the final winding of the mainspring) are rendered concretely. A few thematic sentences could be trimmed for even greater sharpness, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“books that ripened like fruit,” “eternity folded into itself like origami made of time”). Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous lines and shorter emphatic ones, supporting the accumulative pressure. Occasionally the density of metaphor edges toward lushness that risks abstraction, but it rarely obscures sense, and there’s little outright redundancy or scaffold. The final images land cleanly and precisely, suggesting strong line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and generally well-controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“caught light like frozen tears,” “streams of liquid history”). Rhythm varies nicely and paragraphs carry momentum rather than looping. There is occasional overstatement or near-platitude at thematic peaks, but figurative language remains coherent and rarely feels purple or muddled. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening possible around explicit thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally precise and musical, with images like “midnight itself grew teeth and swallowed the sun’s first light” and the rust spreading on tools doing multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, tone, stakes). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding; most lines either advance action or deepen atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and controlled, avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. The main limitation is a small cluster of somewhat platitudinous final sentences that flatten, rather than sharpen, the otherwise vivid closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, interiority, and theme) with few redundancies, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Imagery (e.g., “realities folded into the limestone like pressed flowers in a book”) is vivid and largely controlled. There is some repetition around “petrichor,” “explanations fail,” and similar abstractions, and the final paragraph leans slightly expository rather than purely imagistic. Still, there are no serious artifacts, and momentum holds through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, imagistic, and generally do more than one job, advancing mood, character, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors like “time folded like origami” and “turbine-hum reverie of creation” are striking yet coherent with the established aesthetic. There’s mild risk of thematic overstatement in a few explanatory lines, but little in the way of redundancy, scaffolding, or muddled imagery. Rhythm and clarity hold well through the closing beats, preserving the final image’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and multi-functional, with very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Imagery like “flowers that opened only in darkness, petals that caught moonlight like memories” is vivid and largely coherent. The density of figurative language is high, and certain abstractions or repeated constructions (“tenderness of hidden things,” “dawning hush”) flirt with over-ornamentation but don’t significantly obscure sense or momentum. A light tightening of a few near-echoes and abstractions would push this fully into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich without tipping into incoherence; sentences tend to carry multiple functions (world, mood, and theme) efficiently. Phrases like “in her searing reverie” and the infinity of floating libraries land as strong, memorable images. There’s very little scaffolding or repetition, and the narrative flows smoothly from sentence to sentence. A few closing lines veer toward summary statement rather than concrete image, slightly dulling the final beat’s sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean, clear, and purposeful, with evocative imagery (“windows dark as dead eyes,” the bottle pulsing then cooling) and minimal redundancy. Rhythm varies well across exposition and peak moments, and there are few if any true artifacts or muddled metaphors. Some mid-story exposition (“working memory wasn’t just recall…”) and thematic generalization slightly slow momentum, though they remain intelligible. Tightening a few explanatory lines and letting images carry more weight would heighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and economical; nearly every line advances atmosphere, world, or theme without scaffold, synonym churn, or obvious loops. Figurative language is striking yet controlled, usually doing double duty for worldbuilding and concept (e.g., the description of sound as patterns prefigures the prophecy mechanism). Sentence rhythm is varied and readable aloud, and there are no mixed metaphors or density spikes that blur sense at peak beats. The final images (glass case, rising waters, ripening apples) are cleanly rendered and land with clarity and weight.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and largely clean, purposeful imagery (seeds as compressed time, ice sublimating as entropy drops). There is some metaphor saturation and conceptual repetition (“wild and serene,” “furiously tranquil”) that edges toward purple but rarely muddies meaning. No major scaffolding, loops, or grammatical slips interfere with clarity or closure. A touch more restraint—letting a few clean concrete images stand without additional abstraction—would make the best lines hit even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, mostly concise, and rhythmically varied; it balances description, interiority, and action without major redundancies or scaffolding. Several lines carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, stakes) efficiently, and figurative language is generally apt and controlled. There are a few moments of slight over-explanation or reiteration, and some metaphors risk mild purple if pushed any further, but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Line-level craft is strong and publishable, even if not yet at an unmistakably standout level.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty with image and idea. There is some repetition of conceptual language (vulnerability, strength, stillness, understanding) and a few lines that read like thematic slogans rather than lived perception. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not excessively purple. Overall momentum holds, but trimming a handful of explanatory sentences would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“broken teeth,” “captured sunset,” “heavy and luminous as honey in abandoned combs”) that do multiple jobs—world-building, mood, and theme. Sentence rhythm varies well and sustains momentum despite a reflective mode; there’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent with the beekeeping/oasis motif. A few phrases repeat conceptual territory (e.g., “weight” and “silence” as abstractions) enough to be faintly redundant, but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally tight and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme; the metaphors around time’s texture and crystallization largely land cleanly. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose maintains momentum despite being idea-heavy. A few lines verge on abstraction or mild purple (“stood suddenly timeless because it existed in all moments simultaneously”), but they remain legible and on-concept. Overall density and rhythm are strong, just shy of the crystalline precision expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong imagery (“each barbule a thread waiting to be woven into dawn,” “lagoon resumed its breathing”) and good syntactic variety. There is a high density of figurative language, but it remains coherent and legible rather than muddled, and repetition around “broken” and “beauty” is more thematic than loop-like. Very little scaffolding or redundancy appears; most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme) efficiently. The main limitation is that the lyrical register occasionally edges toward purple, slightly softening momentum and bite.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is fluent, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; images like “salt spray on a windless day” and “die at the correct frequency” are striking without becoming incoherent. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and thematically unified around frequencies, minerals, and growth. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax supports momentum from setup to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong rhythm, vivid images, and high information density; nearly every sentence advances concept, mood, or character. Phrases like “luminous skepticism” and “mechanism for human consciousness to discover itself” are striking without tipping into purple. There is a mild tendency toward expository summarization in the final third, where key insights are told rather than fully embodied, and a few abstract formulations feel slightly overexplained. Nonetheless, there are no major loops or muddled metaphors, and momentum is well maintained for this contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient: images typically carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, atmosphere) and sentence rhythm prevents the lyricism from congealing. Phrases like “narrow vastness” and “submerged concord” feel considered rather than ornamental, and there’s little true scaffolding or repetition. At times, figurative language edges toward the purple (e.g., “telling him where the earth hungered most,” “liquid fertilizer, transformed by decomposition into something viciously fertile”), which risks softening impact through abstraction. Trimming a few high-level metaphors in favor of more concrete friction would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that generally do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) at once. Phrases like “wild hush that infected everyone who'd survived the wars” and “every crack in the earth readable as scripture” are vivid without tipping into purple, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Prose propulsion remains steady from opening through closure, with no major momentum-sapping exposition blocks. A few metaphorical flourishes verge on familiar, but they don’t materially dull clarity or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with good rhythmic variation, and images like “moments pulled thin like taffy across hours” or “starlight remembered in gold” are striking and apt. The prose flirts with density but mostly avoids purple excess, and there are few, if any, scaffold or paraphrase loops. A couple of abstractions (“navigation encoded in beauty,” “a map for the lost souls”) could be grounded in more concrete language, and repeated “echoed silence”/“confusion into exploration” phrasing slightly undercuts tension. Still, clarity and propulsion remain intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Imagery such as “the sky writhed in impossible geometries” and the mirror showing first discovery of magic is striking without becoming purple or tangled. There’s little to no scaffolding, synonym loops, or clunky exposition, and syntax remains clear even when language becomes lyrical. A high concentration of metaphoric description is present but it’s purposeful and doesn’t blur sense or slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) with minimal redundancy, and rhythm varies effectively. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically aligned—whispers as ghosts of legislation, pawns as history’s dead, interregnum as penumbra. I don’t see paraphrase loops or scaffolded filler; nearly every line earns its space and advances the accumulative pressure. A hair of abstraction in a couple of phrases keeps this just shy of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, confident, and varied in sentence structure, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (e.g., the stone’s message as feather-texture) is consistent and thematically aligned rather than piled-on ornament. There is little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn; momentum holds despite the lyricism. A very slight tendency toward lushness in low-pressure moments is the only thing keeping this just short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with vivid, mostly coherent imagery and high information density; lines often do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“fierce repose of this temporal prison,” “memories being revised by understanding rather than regret”). Sentence rhythms are varied enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and there are few, if any, syntactic or clarity errors. A handful of phrases verge on purple or abstract (“the bitter edge of his self-condemnation,” “wisdom winnowed from the labyrinth’s silence”) and occasionally restate what the scene has already shown, but they do not materially drag momentum or obscure cause and effect. Overall, the line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, vivid, and generally economical, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. The central metaphoric web (prisms, refraction, water, echoes) is consistent and largely unmuddled, and there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A mild tendency to repeat abstractions like “truth,” “forgiveness,” and “complexity” in close proximity slightly blunts the sharpness of some lines. Overall, momentum and clarity are well maintained, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful metaphors (“time moved strangely…between breaths held underwater”), and minimal redundancy; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and stakes. The prose approaches lush but generally avoids purple excess, and clauses are well-controlled with no confusing simultaneity or loops. There are a few moments of conceptual repetition (“transmuting despair into something eternal,” “dire enchantment against the void”) and quasi-abstract phrasing that feel slightly over-articulated. These minor ornamental flourishes in the closing paragraphs keep it from 9-band precision.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are generally lean, purposeful, and rhythmically varied, with most lines doing multiple jobs (advancing plot, revealing character, and building atmosphere at once). Metaphors are apt and not over-stacked; images like “caves yawned like dark mouths against the tide” and “temporary eternities” are clear and tonally consistent. There’s minimal scaffold or repetition, and syntax remains transparent even in more lyrical stretches. A few thematic statements could be slightly trimmed for sharper impact, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax, clear sequencing, and high information density; most sentences do at least two jobs (image + emotion, or world rule + theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and sensorially grounded, though phrases like “garden of sensation” and “gentle violence of refusing to let go” skirt purple. There are no evident paraphrase loops or scaffolding remnants, and rhythm modulates effectively toward the climax. The prose’s lushness is a feature here, but a touch of restraint in key lines would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lean yet lyrical, with strong verbs and purposeful images (e.g., “build bridges from words until the last caller found their way home”) doing multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately between stress (shorter, physical beats at the crank) and reflection (slightly longer, thematic lines). There is very little scaffolding or repetition; exposition about the world is folded smoothly into action. A few abstractions (“vast indifference that had swallowed whole cities”) verge on familiar, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally clean, concise, and image-rich without sliding into purple; sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) efficiently. Metaphors like trees as “broken arms” and “hanged men” are strong and consistent with the grim setting, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or confusing constructions, and the closure image of the blind eye clicking against truffles is sharp. A few explanatory lines about Victorian alienists and cross-referencing neuroscience flirt with info-dump but remain just within efficient density for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, images are generally precise, and almost every line carries either atmospheric or narrative weight. The prose balances density and clarity, avoiding significant loops or scaffolding, and the closing image recalls prior motifs without clutter. There are minor hints of purple or over-explanation (particularly in the explicit naming of the son and of “baptism”) where implication might have sufficed. These are small slips; momentum and readability remain high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lean for its lyric mode, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character insight—without obvious redundancy. Metaphors are generally apt and not overstacked, and the rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. Lines like “the air tasted of minerals and promises, thick with the weight of midsummer despite the season being wrong” verge on density but remain clear and purposeful. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic tics dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly tight, do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, plot) and flow well when read aloud. Metaphors (“voice like silk drawn across broken glass,” “stone glowed… like a bruised heart”) are vivid and coherent, with no major mixed-image muddle. There is some density of figurative language, but it remains legible and purposeful, not gratuitously purple. No noticeable scaffold, repetition loops, or syntactic templates drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery ("ember nexus glowed like a dying heart," "a small infinity, spiraling home") and generally high information density. Metaphor use is frequent but coherent, anchored in light, warmth, and geometry, and it rarely tips into strained or mixed comparison. Sentence rhythm varies nicely, supporting both reflective and climactic moments without obvious scaffold or loops. A few phrases ("scientifically romantic in the truest sense") flirt with over-noticing the text’s own cleverness, but not enough to damage clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are generally clean, and most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding plus emotion, etc.). Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition; the circularity feels intentional rather than accidental looping. A few formulations verge on density for their own sake, but they don’t materially blur causality or the closing image. Overall, it reads as carefully crafted and essentially publication-ready at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, with varied rhythm and high information density; images like “water sang different notes through copper versus brass” feel fresh and precise. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. A few phrases edge toward the abstract or mildly purple (“ordinary miracles,” “mapping emotional terrain”) but they don’t significantly impede clarity or momentum. Overall, the prose would require only light tightening to be publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and generally high information density—details often serve both atmosphere and character. Imagery around crystals, storms, and breath is coherent and thematically aligned rather than random ornament. There is some leaning toward lush description, but it does not obscure causality or momentum, and there are no obvious scaffold sentences or synonym loops. Minor tendencies toward familiar figurative moves (“like dropped porcelain”) keep it just shy of the truly exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, vivid, and information-dense without feeling bloated, and almost every line carries atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is mostly sharp and controlled (perfume as current, ghosts humming unfinished symphonies), with no noticeable loops or scaffolding. The rhythm shifts appropriately as pressure rises, with the falling trees punctuating the softer lyricism. Occasional near-sententious lines (“Sometimes reconnection requires breaking apart first”) slightly flatten the texture into thesis, but they don’t seriously harm propulsion or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally precise, image-rich, and economical for this density of concept; sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and motion). Rhythmic variation is good, and there is little obvious scaffolding or synonym-churn repetition. Some lines lean on abstract noun-stacks (“the space between spaces, for the moment before moments”) and near-similar constructions recur, which slightly blurs edges but does not harm closure clarity. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language (e.g., fjord as “mercury in a basin,” fingers “like bird bones”) is vivid and coherent without piling into purple excess. There’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping; momentum flows smoothly through the countdown structure. Minor abstractions near the end slightly thin immediacy, but they don’t blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and layered images like the “quiet wildfire” of discovery and the farm glowing “like a constellation beneath the earth.” Sentences typically do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, character, and theme—without obvious padding, and transitions are smooth. There is some conceptual repetition around “boundaries,” “barriers,” and their permeability, and occasional abstract phrasing, which slightly blunts sharpness. Still, there are no major artifacts, mixed metaphors, or momentum-stalling loops, and the closing lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and strong information density; most lines serve multiple functions (character, setting, theme). Images like “grocery lists bleeding into differential equations” and “clover in late summer” are striking without becoming overwrought. There is some conceptual repetition around “contradiction,” “certainty,” and “chaos,” and a few lines verge on slogan-like, but they don’t seriously drag momentum or obscure sense. Overall, the line-level work is strong and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is controlled and economical for a lyric piece: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Recurrent phrases (“endings,” “lost,” “wrong numbers”) feel intentional rather than redundant, and the rhythm varies well. A few metaphors and aphoristic turns lean toward the purple or familiar, slightly dulling their impact. Overall, though, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the final image is cleanly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images do multiple jobs (sensory grounding, characterization, theme) and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The recurring tea/ink/steeping metaphor set is cohesive rather than overstuffed, and modifiers are mostly precise. Momentum holds despite the reflective mode because each paragraph either advances knowledge (the fire’s cause) or sharpens the impending choice. The main limitation is a mild tendency toward overtly abstract phrasing in the final paragraph, which slightly dilutes the otherwise image-driven intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, varied in rhythm, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for character and atmosphere (“her grin sharp enough to cut glass” both visualizes and characterizes). There is minimal redundancy or scaffold, and figurative language is generally clean and consistent with the story’s logic. A few lines tilt toward aphoristic abstraction, but they do not significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. Line-level craft comfortably clears professional standards and supports the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“Portuguese flooded through her skin like warm honey”). Rhythm varies well and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The main limitation is a mild tendency toward conceptual repetition and abstract noun clusters (“architecture,” “territories,” “emotional depths”) that slightly blur sharpness. Imagery remains coherent and doesn’t obstruct clarity, but a touch more concrete grounding in a few lines would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean, vivid, and efficient: “bent starlight into impossible spirals” and “editing history” as a cosmic editor are strong, memorable formulations. Information density is good, with most sentences carrying both conceptual and emotional weight without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases lean abstract (“thresh meaning from experience,” “contingent relationships”) but mostly remain anchored in imagery. There are no serious loops or overwrought metaphor clusters that impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, imagery is mostly precise, and nearly every line carries both scene and emotional weight. The metaphor of the harbor, light, and the empty camera is sustained without descending into muddled or mixed figures, and there is little to no paraphrase looping or filler. A few phrasings brush familiar lyric territory (“harbor glowed like spilled mercury,” “ache of beauty without sound”), but they don’t materially dull clarity or closure. The final paragraphs in particular are clean, tight, and well-cadenced.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and dense with information, and metaphors (e.g., lava cooling into new earth) are apt and consistent with the premise. There’s some repetition of key phrases and a few expository lines that tell theme rather than letting image carry it, but no serious loops or purple muddle. The prose maintains momentum despite reflection-heavy passages. It’s polished and submission-ready, if not yet razor-honed to absolute minimality.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for image and concept (“auric waters rose, spilling beyond their containment into the sound wave garden”). Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned, and the line-level momentum rarely stalls. There is some flirtation with purple abstraction (“space between spaces,” “the hush of the universe inhaling”), but these moments are controlled and pattern-consistent rather than muddled. Redundancy and scaffold are minimal, and syntax remains clear even in the most lyric passages.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally avoid redundancy, with imagery that is vivid without tipping into purple. Metaphors (labyrinth, amphitheater, aurora as green fire) are coherent and support both atmosphere and theme. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or filter-verb stacks that blunt momentum. A few abstractions in the final sentences (“wisdom traveled best in whispers”) slightly reduce sharpness, but they don’t significantly mar the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images are concrete, and most lines carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without bogging pace. There is some redundancy and purple edging—several late sentences reiterate the darkness/light thesis in slightly different abstractions, and metaphors pile up in places. The final paragraph in particular could be tightened by cutting explicit commentary while keeping the potent images. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained, and no major artifacts obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with generally efficient sentences that carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious padding. Occasional phrases edge toward the purple or repetitive (“forests of second thoughts,” “amplified quiet”) but do not accumulate into real drag or muddle. Figurative language is coherent and aligned with the chess/quiet-rebellion imagery, and there are no evident scaffold loops or syntactic templates dulling momentum. Line-level control supports the closure image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions, and maintain clarity while sustaining a lyrical register. Images like the island “not emerging but becoming” and “space between truth and possibility” are strong without turning to purple prose. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffold or template cadence artifacts. A few abstract, thesis-like lines slightly dull momentum near the end, but they do not obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: images like “her expression as empty as winter sky” and “each curl of wood falling like a secret” are vivid without tipping into purple. Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and character—without padding, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping. The prose modulates tempo effectively, lingering on key gestures (the crumbling petal, the bird’s lightness) while keeping overall momentum. Figurative language is controlled and internally coherent, especially the sustained carving/lightness metaphor that undergirds the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied syntax, relatively high information density, and few if any mechanical errors. Metaphors are generally coherent and in-character, though they cluster densely—“cloud-shadow,” “living calligraphy,” “lantern-moth hush,” “paraphrase reality itself”—pushing toward purple in places. There is some conceptual repetition (boundaries dissolving, permeability, fixed forms) that could be tightened, but it does not materially obscure causality or the closing image. Momentum holds across the scene despite the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is controlled, with good sentence variety and a high density of purposeful detail; there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors (shades of gray, broken glass, ashes) are consistent and not overextended, aligning with character and theme. The rhythm supports the calm, accumulative build of the story and the final image lands cleanly without purple excess. A few thematic statements could be trimmed or grounded more in image, but line-level craft is comfortably publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, descriptive details carry thematic weight, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors (cathedral of potential, texture of connection) are coherent and grounded in the story’s concrete objects. A few lines drift into slightly abstract or slogan-like phrasing, especially near the end, but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Overall, the prose has good information density and moves the scene forward while maintaining atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding, and rhythm alternates between long, flowing lines and concise beats. Repeated motifs like ash/flame, light/dark, and stars are handled with control and avoid metaphorical muddle. There are occasional slightly abstract or summary phrases (“subdued ardor for life,” “genuinely artificial and absolutely true”) that read more like commentary than lived perception, but they don’t seriously drag momentum. No major loops or syntactic tics interfere with clarity, leaving the prose polished and publication-ready with minimal fine-tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally tight and vivid, with effective metaphors such as the measuring tape “marked not with inches but with algorithmic intervals” and ghost data “singing through the walls.” Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, enriching tone rather than smothering clarity. There’s little in the way of obvious scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony. It stops short of exceptional because the density of metaphor occasionally flirts with being decorative rather than carrying new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and economical for its density: most sentences carry setting, emotion, and concept at once without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language (“refracting the sunset into impossible geometries that hurt to perceive directly,” “atoms of nostalgia”) is vivid and largely coherent, and rhythm varies in step with the scene’s pressure. A few lines in the final third lean toward conceptual abstraction over concrete image, slightly dulling the immediacy of the closure beat. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density; many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Figurative language (“trembling like a dark aurora,” “colors that had no names, only feelings”) is generally precise and evocative. There is mild abstraction and thematic restatement in the final third, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or blur images. No major artifacts or loops impair clarity, and the closing image with the stone’s shadow is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lean yet vivid, with most sentences doing double duty (advancing action and deepening emotion or image), e.g., the tail “blazed quietly vivid against the darkness.” There are no noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences; the syntax varies and carries momentum through what is essentially a reflective night. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess even around charged images like mist and stars. Line-level craft easily meets a high-market standard, though there’s a touch of familiar phrasing (“layers of deception”) that keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are generally precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (world, mood, and theme at once). Metaphors like “meteor hush” and “scars were libraries” are memorable and internally coherent, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. The density of figurative language occasionally approaches purple, with several metaphors stacked in close succession, but clarity remains intact and closure isn’t dulled. Tightening a few abstractions and reiterated insights would elevate this to truly top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, theme) with little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful; images of storage, projection, and incubation create a unified metaphor field rather than a grab bag. There are almost no paraphrase loops or clunky transitions, and grammar and pacing are clean. The density of metaphor comes close to purple in spots but remains intelligible and doesn’t blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: vivid imagery, mostly clean syntax, and a good balance of description and motion keep momentum despite the contemplative mode. Some metaphors and intensifiers verge on purple (“smoke made of pure potential,” “liquid emerald,” repeated stardust rhetoric), and reflection occasionally restates what the images already imply. However, information density is high; most lines are doing multiple jobs, and the closure image is clear and uncluttered. Trimming a few redundant phrases and sharpening 1–2 mixed metaphors would push this toward top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and mood) and the rhythm varies well. There is a high density of metaphor and coined phrases, but they are mostly coherent and purposeful rather than decorative purple prose. One could trim a few compounded images (“quantum flowers… probability waves,” “markets of never-was”) for even more sharpness, yet they don’t significantly impede momentum or sense. The final paragraphs in particular land cleanly, with the clock and dune reprises free of figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense: sentences typically do double duty, advancing both worldbuilding and thematic frame. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, e.g., memory as “peeling back layers of encoded memory,” avoiding mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; the momentum stays steady despite reflection-heavy content.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, with most images pulling double duty for atmosphere and theme. Metaphors (“mist clung like unspoken prayers,” “beard moved like kelp in unfelt currents”) are fresh and coherent with the water/shore motif. The prose largely avoids redundancy and scaffold; progression is smooth, and the closing lines are particularly clean and charged. A high concentration of figurative language edges toward lush, but it doesn’t tip into obscurity or true purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; the prose balances lyricism with clarity, especially in the opening and closing images. Metaphors are controlled and mostly apt (the fortress’s “whispered apology,” “agreement between sound and silence”), with no significant overwriting or mixed imagery. There are a few mildly abstract or summary lines (“frostbitten hope that beauty could survive even the harshest winters”) that flirt with purple, but they remain legible and do not stall momentum. No major scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony appears at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clear, efficient, and rhythmically varied, with high information density—most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme). Figurative language is controlled and coherent, e.g., “time's conspiracy,” and avoids muddle or mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the action at the climax is easy to follow. A few phrases lean toward generalized mythic abstraction rather than concrete embodiment, but they don’t materially harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and information-dense, with a good mix of concrete image and conceptual weight; the rhythm of short declaratives against more flowing lines works. There is some repetition around the reef’s whiteness and the fossil fuel ban, but it mostly serves emphasis rather than padding. A few phrases verge on over-explicit restatement (“The revelation had been delayed by decades of misunderstanding”) where an image might suffice, and the “water that remembered everything, forgot nothing” line leans toward familiar poeticism. Nonetheless, there is little true scaffold or muddle, and the closing paragraphs in particular read crisply and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images concrete, and most metaphors (“cathedral of rust,” “thunderous serenity”) are precise and evocative without collapsing into muddle. The prose carries multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, mood, and character interiority—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few lines risk over-writing or thematic redundancy (opera/orchestra metaphors are layered heavily), but they don’t seriously slow momentum or obscure sense. Information density and clarity remain high through the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally lean yet evocative, with images like “consciousness brushing against hers like silk scarves in wind” and “the Earth’s own insurgent spirit” doing layered work without excess. There is little redundancy or scaffolding; each line advances either atmosphere, world, or stakes. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and I see no major loops or muddled metaphors that cloud the climax or ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is lean but lush, with high information density: images like “drones that moved like wasps against the sky” and “joy itself had become suspect” do multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies well, balancing longer lyric lines with shorter, grounded beats that keep momentum. There are no noticeable loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffolding; description remains precise and purposeful rather than purple. The final paragraphs in particular are clean, powerful, and free of line-level clutter, fully supporting the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and mostly efficient: images like “glass fell upward, tinkling like chimes” and “books breathing dust” are both vivid and functional, advancing mood and world simultaneously. Sentence-level variety is good, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line carries character, setting, or thematic weight. The density of figurative language approaches the edge of overload but generally maintains clarity, with only a few moments of near-redundant abstraction around “threads” and “wholeness.” A touch more restraint or occasional plainer sentence in high-intensity moments would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean: sentences are grammatical, varied, and information-dense, with some strong images and no serious clarity issues. There is some purple edging (“wild truth of existence,” “quantum foam”) and paraphrastic reiteration of the same idea (time, consciousness, crisis) in slightly different abstract terms. Explanatory sentences occasionally repeat what the imagery already implies, which dampens momentum. Overall, the prose is solid and publishable in many venues, but not stripped of scaffolding or cliché enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with little waste, and images like “vault…hummed with the peculiar silence of frozen time” are strong and coherent. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined, with recurring crystalline/ice motifs that feel patterned rather than purple. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic tics dragging momentum. A few metaphors verge on decorative rather than necessary, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied syntax, good rhythm, and images that mostly pull their weight without clutter. The prose packs multiple functions into single lines (worldbuilding + psychology + theme) with minimal redundancy, and transitions are smooth. Occasionally the language tips toward the ornamental or slogan-like, but figurative density never overwhelms clarity or momentum. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops, grammatical slips, or cadence artifacts that dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) and generally avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but controlled; images like “prowling cat made of departed music” and emotions crystallizing into ice bells are vivid without becoming incoherent. Rhythm and paragraphing sustain momentum, with no major loops or opacity. The occasional near-pileup of metaphors edges toward ornamentation, but it doesn’t blur causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty (advancing plot while reinforcing motif, e.g., the pen’s shadow tracing ellipses). Figurative language is mostly precise and thematically aligned; it seldom feels like decorative purple. Information flows clearly with no noticeable loops or scaffolding, and the final image (clouds like old newsprint held to flame) is strong. At times the figurative density risks overrichness, which slightly blunts sharpness under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, dense with metaphor and image yet largely clear and efficient; most sentences do more than one job, weaving world-building, mood, and theme together. There is some risk of purple density—“meteor hush,” “subsonic guilt,” “digital blood”—but the figurative network remains internally consistent and legible. Repetition reads intentional rather than scaffolded, and there are no significant loops or syntactic tics to drag momentum. Line-level craft supports, rather than obscures, the closure image of the pulsing constellation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and on-theme, with minimal padding or synonym loops. A few sentences verge on essayistic abstraction (“The unlearning wasn’t about erasure—it was about composting the past into fertile ground.”), but even those are tightly phrased and supported by concrete images before and after. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or structural artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “its fractures spreading starlight across the ancient plaza like a promise” are vivid and precise, and most sentences do double duty advancing both mood and meaning. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; the prose moves with purpose. A few formulations (“warm coldness of necessary change,” “cradling empathy in arms of steel”) lean toward conceptual/purple but remain coherent. Rhythm and clarity hold through the ending, keeping the closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level writing is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and coherent with the synesthetic conceit, and the prose sustains lyricism without major muddle. A few lines flirt with purple abstraction (“time’s beautiful wounds,” “possibility’s sharp mint”) yet remain intelligible and supported by context. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and many lines doing double duty (sensory + conceptual). Metaphors like “willowglass hope” and “dendrites of possibility” feel mostly fresh and aligned with the premise; repetition around muscovite, light, and pathways builds a deliberate texture rather than clutter. There is some density of figurative language and abstraction, especially in expository stretches, that verges on purple but stops short of obscuring clarity or momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is strong and controlled enough for near-publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, atmosphere, and thematic weight simultaneously. Imagery is coherent and rarely overwrought, and the rhythm (longer, flowing sentences) suits the meditative, accumulative design. There is some abstraction and mild repetition of conceptual phrases (“transitional object,” “emotional residue,” “science was factually mystical”) that edge toward expository summary. Still, clarity is high, scaffolding is minimal, and line-level craft is solidly publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose often achieves a graceful, imagistic quality, with strong metaphors like “light like frozen honey” and “pulverized dreams.” Nonetheless, there is noticeable abstraction and repetition around key concepts (prophecy, wisdom, possibility, truth unraveling) that verge on purple and dilute momentum. Several sentences paraphrase or reiterate similar ideas (prophecy as assembled/possibility/futures spun) rather than advancing image, situation, or emotion. Line-level craft is solid but would benefit from tightening and a higher ratio of concrete image to conceptual language.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“Three years of anger compressed into four syllables”). There is some repetition of key phrases and a mild tendency toward elevated, slightly purple turns, but it rarely muddies clarity. Line-level momentum is good; exposition is compact, and there’s little scaffolding or obvious synonym-churn. The final image is clear and resonant, not dulled by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (palimpsest, sheet music, golden thread) is coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload. There’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy; the prose moves with quiet propulsion. A couple of elevated phrases risk slight ornament, but they don’t impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Metaphors are generally fresh and legible, and repetition (e.g., of thrumming, sun patterns, pottery motions) reads as patterned rather than redundant. There’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn, and the prose sustains momentum despite being reflective. A few abstractions (“one true way to exist”) are slightly generic compared to the rest, but they don’t materially blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: images are mostly fresh, scaffolding is minimal, and sentences do multiple jobs (advancing action while shading theme). There’s a clear rhythmic modulation between descriptive density and quieter, declarative beats near the end. A few lines verge on explanatory or overdetermined symbolism, but they don’t seriously drag momentum or obscure the closure. Overall, the prose shows strong control with only minor tendencies toward thematic overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, image-dense, and pull double duty for worldbuilding and emotion, with little redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors are generally sharp and coherent (cracked like an egg, brittle before transformation, the library breathing) rather than piled-on purple. There’s a high density of figurative language, but it mostly serves the lyric tone and doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image. Minor moments of abstraction (“translate her crushing isolation into something she could bear”) could be made more concrete, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, rich in image yet mostly precise, with few redundancies and clean mechanics. Figurative language (“whimsy was simply wisdom wearing dancing shoes”; “lotus petals cast prismatic shadows”) is vivid and usually coherent, contributing to tone and theme. There is a mild risk of lushness tipping into sentimentality in the final paragraphs, but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum. The prose consistently carries multiple jobs—setting, emotion, and theme—without obvious scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and images like “metallic sentinels” and “cosmic tricksters” are memorable. Exposition about the AI and its manipulation is somewhat compressed and declarative, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. There are no evident scaffolding loops, strained metaphors, or rhythm glitches in key beats. The prose could push further into idiosyncrasy or sensory embodiment under stress to reach a truly elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for mood and meaning, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is apt and not over-stacked, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. A few phrases lean on familiar abstractions or repeat key terms (“mutiny,” “rebellion,” “tyranny”) in ways that slightly flatten freshness at peak beats, but they don’t materially harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically clean, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is generally apt (“public virtue lancing through private vice like light through prisms”) and not overstacked. Description and reflection both pull weight for character and theme, and transitions between them are smooth. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in the final third trims the topmost range but does not significantly dull clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with most sentences doing dual work (worldbuilding + mood, or character + plot) and a good rhythm between longer descriptive lines and shorter beats of action. Metaphors like “pressed against her ribs like wet wool” are vivid without becoming purple, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Technical exposition is handled cleanly and doesn’t bog momentum despite a high concept load. A touch more syntactic variety at peak pressure and one or two sharper, unexpected images would nudge this closer to truly standout line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and often striking, with images like the dissolving hitchhiker and reality “developing like a photograph in reverse” doing double duty for mood and concept. There is some density of figurative language, yet most metaphors are coherent and on-theme rather than piled on arbitrarily. A few sentences in the final paragraphs veer into slightly purple, explanatory territory, but they do not obscure causality or the closure image. Overall momentum is maintained despite reflective passages, which are well-anchored in concrete cues (glass, wind, fiddle).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, imagistic, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“phantom thieves from statistical noise”). There are no serious clarity lapses or obvious scaffolding/loop artifacts, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. Some figurative phrasing and aphoristic lines near the end flirt with purple or redundancy, but they don’t materially obscure action or cost. Trimming a few explicit abstractions would elevate line-level sharpness to a truly elite register.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“It sounded like whale song, mournful and profound”). A few phrases lean toward the familiar or slightly purple (“whisper of starlight,” “midnight solace of infinite space”), but they don’t accumulate to real bloat or muddle meaning. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; information advances steadily. Line-level control is strong enough for publication, though not quite at a dazzlingly distinctive level.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, rhythm varies, and most metaphors are both clear and thematically resonant. The prose carries high information density without much scaffolding or redundancy. A few phrases verge on purple or conceptual (“what mirrors couldn’t show,” “spaces between truth and deception”) and pile abstraction atop abstraction, which slightly dulls immediacy. Still, clarity at key beats is preserved, and there are no major syntactic or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and characterization) with few redundancies. Metaphors are mostly controlled and thematically cohesive (roots, scars, light, time), with only occasional risk of density edging into purple, but clarity remains intact. There’s no obvious scaffold or template cadence, and punctuation/grammar are clean. The prose is strong and often beautiful, just short of the rare, razor-precise compression that would push into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful information, with few if any redundancies. Figurative language (veins, roots threading bones, light flooding, ash shaping into promise) is vivid and generally disciplined rather than piled on for its own sake. The prose does edge toward the lush in places, but it does not blur sense or stall momentum, and the final images land cleanly. No obvious scaffold, loops, or mechanical artifacts interfere with causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lean, precise, and multi-functional: technical terms, sensory images, and emotional cues often arrive in the same sentence. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, with few to no paraphrase loops or scaffolding (“he…” beats or redundant explanations) to bog momentum. Figurative language (“walls that swallowed sound,” “ghost vibrations”) is controlled and coherent with the sonic motif rather than purple or mixed. A tiny amount of thematic abstraction in the closing paragraphs is noticeable but does not significantly blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and there is little wasted scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language (e.g., “morning mist dissolving,” “seeds of knowing”) is mostly apt and not overstacked. Some abstractions (“knowledge made tangible through forces science barely comprehended,” “patterns of pure information”) lean explanatory rather than sensorial, softening immediacy but not obscuring meaning. The final lines land cleanly despite a slight drift toward essayistic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly tight, varied in length, and multi-functional, often carrying worldbuilding, mood, and character in one move. Figurative language (e.g., memories like silk threads, voice as a chord) is apt and rarely mixed; it enhances without obscuring clarity. There is some mild repetition of conceptual language around paradox, identity, and transformation that edges toward over-signaling theme, but it never stalls momentum. No noticeable grammatical or syntactic artifacts interfere with reading or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with images (scratched confessions, hairline fractures “like veins of hope”) doing meaningful multi-duty. Figurative language is mostly controlled and thematically aligned with shells, walls, light, and dissolution. There is minor redundancy and a touch of purple or abstract phrasing near the end, but not enough to drag momentum or obscure closure. The prose is publishable with only light tightening of the explicitly expository lines.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with many lines doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“dust wheezed out like a confession”; the bellows’ taped patches “catching the light like scales”). Sentence rhythms and paragraphing support a slow, accumulating pressure well suited to the subject. There is a mild tendency toward stacked, self-conscious aphorisms in the final third, but not enough to seriously blunt clarity or momentum. No major scaffolding, repetition, or figurative muddle undermines the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, concept) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned with time, light, and breath—rarely purple enough to obscure meaning. There are no apparent loops or template cadences, and the closing image lands cleanly. A slight reduction in stacked abstractions near the ending could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the violin’s wail as genocide and cultural burning). Line-level clarity generally holds despite the figurative load, and there are no major scaffolding loops or syntactic confusions. That said, metaphor frequency is high—bruised twilight, confession booth drapes, mulberry blood, promise changing color—which edges toward purple and occasionally risks numbing impact. A slightly leaner line at key beats would likely be required for top-tier literary markets, but the craft is already above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, vivid images, and generally high information density—most sentences earn their keep. Figurative language is rich but not so dense that it muddies sense, and key beats (the chip singing, the grotto freezing) are clearly rendered. There are a few mildly purple or redundant touches (“beautiful, terrible,” reiterated formulations of stillness and sculpture) and a couple of explanatory sentences that could be sharper. These are minor slips rather than structural line-level problems.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful imagery (“mist clung…like silk,” “shadows pooled…like aged wine”) that rarely tips into clutter. Sentences tend to do multiple jobs—advancing action while reinforcing atmosphere and theme—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few metaphors feel slightly stacked, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image; the final paragraphs in particular are clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmic, varied, and information-dense, with images that usually do double duty for mood and theme. There’s some tendency toward stacked aphorisms that risk feeling didactic, but they rarely bog momentum or obscure sense. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors interfere with clarity, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. A touch more restraint in the “thesis” lines would move this closer to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, imagistic, and mostly multi-task—advancing mood, concept, and world simultaneously. Metaphors (“sycamore hush,” “cells remembering tomorrow while forgetting yesterday”) are fresh and coherent with the premise. There is some density of figurative language, but it rarely becomes muddled or redundant, and clarity remains intact through the ending. I see no major loops or scaffolding sentences dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight and evocative, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character in tandem. Metaphors are original and thematically aligned, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. A few phrases (“wound in the earth,” “marrow and memory”) edge toward familiar lyric registers, but they don’t create confusion or drag. Rhythm and sentence variation support a measured, meditative momentum that suits the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and multi-functional, often advancing setting, theme, and emotion simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with only occasional mild over-insistence on motif phrases (“brilliant dimness,” “sacred in the simple”). There are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts, and the final image sequence is clear and resonant, if slightly over-explained thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, and theme) with generally strong verbs and concrete images, and the rhythm varies well across paragraphs. Sensory metaphors such as “meteor hush” and “the moment before stars fall” feel largely coherent with the world, and there’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic templating. At times the density of figurative language and explicit abstracting (“gift or curse,” “our real work begins now”) edges toward overstatement, slightly dulling the sharpened mystery. Overall, though, clarity and propulsion remain intact and strong.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally polished and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. Metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically aligned (amber, resonance, tuning fork, breathing universe), and the closing lines land cleanly. There is some drift toward conceptual heaviness and repeated phrasing that verges on purple or redundant (“wavelength aligned,” “static bursts,” explicit restating of causal-loop logic). Even so, clarity is preserved and momentum holds, with no major scaffold or loop artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“dusk paint the sky in bruises,” “its edges soft as grief”). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and well-chosen, rarely tipping into purple or mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; each paragraph adds new emotional or conceptual information. The main limiter is that a few sentences state insights in near-aphoristic form, which slightly blunts the otherwise high implicitness and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“a prayer made of stone,” “water so pure it reflected nothing but sky”) and generally efficient sentences that advance world, character, and stakes simultaneously. A few lines verge on purple or expository density, but they remain coherent and do not stall momentum or obscure cause-and-effect. There’s minor repetition in explicitly re-explaining her theory, yet it doesn’t rise to the level of noticeable scaffolding. Overall, the line-level craft is solidly publication-ready, if slightly more ornate and explanatory than elite venues often prefer.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: vivid but not overwrought metaphors, efficient exposition, and sentences that generally do more than one job (setting, mood, and character at once). There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or clotted figurative stacks that impede clarity. A few constructions (“spinning the fragments into shared meaning,” “mirrored hush”) flirt with abstraction, but they’re supported by concrete images nearby. Pacing is well managed, with descriptive density increasing where the emotional weight rises.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are striking, sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines carry multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and theme simultaneously). There is some metaphor density and minor redundancy in spelling out the logic/intution dichotomy that could be trimmed without loss (“the touch of wonder wasn't something to be captured or catalogued but released” restates what the actions already show). Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closure image is clean and memorable. The prose is polished enough for high-level markets with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-by-line craft is polished: imagery is generally sharp (“soundless echo,” “trees grew upside-down and gravity played tricks”) and sentences do multiple jobs without obvious scaffold. There are a few slightly abstract or familiar turns (“transcends corporate interests,” “essential to planetary survival”), but they don’t seriously dull momentum or clarity. A touch more pruning of abstraction in the final paragraph would elevate the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally tight, clear, and rhythmically varied, with good information density and little scaffolding or redundancy. Images like “the part of me that still remembers terror” and the dojo “indifferent to the history rewriting itself below” are effective and legible. A few phrases edge toward abstract or therapy-like diction (“ego death,” “trauma victims,” “ultimate ego death”) without always being grounded in fresh sensory detail, and some exposition blocks slow momentum slightly. Nonetheless, line-level craft is strong and almost entirely free of confusing metaphors or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs, interweaving atmosphere, characterization, and concept with good economy. Metaphors like logic “flow[ing] like water” and the roots forming geometric patterns are apt, controlled, and thematically aligned. There is occasional purple edging—clusters of elevated images in quick succession—that could be trimmed for sharpness, but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. No significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts interfere with clarity, including in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and multi-functional, with images that carry both emotional and conceptual weight (joy ground into dust fine enough to slip through every attempt to gather it back). There are occasional dense metaphor clusters, but they stay coherent and do not obscure sense or slow momentum significantly. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously, with little scaffolding or redundancy. Line-level control holds through the ending, where the quieter final sentence feels earned rather than deflationary.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, vivid images, and minimal scaffolding (“had taught her patience through endless frozen nights”) do multiple jobs at once. Metaphors are largely coherent and apt, and there’s good rhythmic variation between longer lyric lines and shorter, grounding ones. There is some density of figurative language, but it doesn’t tip into purple or obscure causality, and there are few if any redundancies. A slightly tighter pass might trim one or two explanatory sentences, but this is near–publish-ready at sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: clear syntax, varied rhythm, and vivid metaphors that usually clarify rather than obscure (“living staff of crystallized flame and shadow” is particularly effective). There’s good information density, with backstory, worldbuilding, and emotional context folded into action cleanly. Some lines flirt with purple or redundancy, especially around the theme of breaking/becoming, and a few aphoristic sentences feel more like commentary than lived perception. Still, momentum rarely flags, and there are no serious artifacts, loops, or muddled images.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, and images like “rusted dishes pointed skyward like a congregation of metal prophets” are vivid without devolving into muddle. Figurative language is frequent but generally purposeful and legible, and there’s little in the way of repetition, scaffolding, or template cadence. A few abstractions and direct theme statements slightly dull the sharpness of the closing beats, but they don’t obscure causality or image. The prose would mostly stand as-is in a demanding venue.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, with good sentence variety and a strong ear for cadence; many lines do double duty for world and theme (“when clocks run sideways and time folds into itself”). There is some purple drift and conceptual redundancy, especially around “permanent transience” and explanations of the ferry’s function, but not enough to stall momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled; metaphors align with the time/space motif. Information density is high, and there are no major loops or syntactic confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and most lines carry multiple loads (world-building, theme, and character). Imagery is consistently grounded in the story’s logic; the metaphors are controlled and thematically aligned rather than purple for its own sake. There is some phrase repetition (“patterns began to erupt,” “realistically imaginary”) but it reads as intentional motif rather than looped scaffolding. A touch more compression and a few plainer lines amid the high-density figurative work could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and economical relative to its density, with vivid images (“whale song filtered through crystals,” “bioluminescent pearls”) that usually do more than one job. There are no major loops or scaffold sentences; information flows cleanly and the rhythm supports a contemplative, somber marvel without bogging down. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned with light, depth, and geometry, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. A bit more variation in texture between expository explanation and high-pressure moments could further sharpen momentum, but line-level craft is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, with good syntactic variety and high information density—many sentences carry character, world, and mood simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; the metaphors mostly cohere around sound, bodies, and transmission. There is slight stacking (“reeling hush of forgetting,” “cathedral of suspended gold”) that leans ornamental rather than necessary, but it rarely stalls momentum or clouds meaning. No significant loops, scaffolding, or clarity errors impede the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, the imagery is mostly precise, and almost every line carries narrative or atmospheric weight. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and technical terms (sonar rig, phase chamber, fiber-optic veins) feel integrated rather than expository. There are minimal redundancies and no major artifacts or muddled metaphors; the prose reads smoothly aloud. The occasional conventional simile or phrase keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence structures, clear syntax, and generally high information density with images doing double duty for mood and concept. Repeated heartbeat counts and a few similar constructions (“The screens…,” “The ink…”) create faint rhythmic sameness but not enough to stall momentum. Figurative language stays coherent and on-theme; there’s little purple excess or metaphor muddle. The final paragraphs land cleanly and vividly without scaffold or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and efficient: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept with minimal redundancy. Metaphors are original yet legible (“crack running through its heart like a frozen scream,” “felt like dried lavender crumbling between fingers”) and stay within the story’s sensory and conceptual logic. There’s no evident scaffold, synonym churn, or template cadence, and the final paragraph lands crisply without overexplaining. The density of figurative language approaches lush but is controlled enough not to blur clarity even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and rhythmic, with strong verbs and concrete images (“lavender that floated upward like smoke,” “gravity pocket pull at her bones”) doing double-duty for worldbuilding and mood. There’s minimal redundancy and little in the way of clunky scaffolding or template cadence. A few lines veer into abstraction or cliché (“bloomed into certainty,” “the harmony untamed”) and the closing moral sentence slightly blunts the strangeness of the final image. Still, clarity and momentum are well maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, emotion, and thematic charge simultaneously. Metaphoric language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful; it rarely muddies sense despite the density. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and rhythm modulates reasonably with rising pressure. At times the figurative load flirts with purple, which could be pared slightly in an elite publication edit, but it never derails clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with good integration of worldbuilding, action, and reflection. Some metaphors and abstractions (“where broken promises went to heal,” “invisible authorization of necessity”) flirt with purple prose and could be pared back for even more sharpness. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; each paragraph adds new texture or stakes. The closing image is clean and resonant, not muddled by figurative overload.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, musical, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and character while maintaining clarity. Figurative language (fog as memories, light like water) is generally precise and grounded, with very few mixed or overstrained metaphors. There is mild redundancy and some explicit abstracting near the end, but no major scaffolding or loop artifacts that harm momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and controlled, with strong information density—most sentences carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language (e.g., “equations bloomed into verse,” “shelves breathing like lungs”) is vivid but not excessive, and rhythm varies naturally. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; line-level momentum remains steady and clear. Minor repetition of key concepts (hyperbolic, analog) is purposeful and doesn’t drag.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images precise, and most carry more than one piece of work (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme intertwined). Metaphors (“molten copper,” “luminous absence”) are apt and not over-stacked; the prose skirts purple without tipping over. There’s some mild conceptual repetition around “longing,” “dream,” and “whispers,” and a few summary lines could be tightened, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final image retains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“starlight filtered through impossible angles,” “web of interconnected fears”) and generally high information density. Most sentences do double duty—worldbuilding and atmosphere while advancing Vera’s process. There is a mild tendency toward abstract or lofty phrasing in thematic passages (“cosmic possibility,” “collective will”) that occasionally drifts from concrete embodiment, but it doesn’t significantly blur meaning or momentum. No major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles interfere with clarity, and the closing cadence is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and usually doing multiple jobs (advancing plot, building world, revealing character) without feeling padded. Figurative language (memories as jellyfish, vessels as monuments) is apt and not overstacked, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffold. Syntax is clean and readable, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image. A touch more compression in a couple of explanatory lines could make the prose even leaner.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, image-driven, and densely informative without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and metaphors (shard-mirror archivist, rust-on-iron laugh, spiral of decisions) are coherent and thematically aligned. The prose maintains momentum by embedding description in action and dialogue rather than pausing for static blocks. There is no noticeable synonym churn, template cadence, or filter-verb stacking that obscures causality or dulls the closure image; the final paragraphs in particular are clean and economical. A few sentences flirt with ornamentation, but they remain controlled enough not to feel purple.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density and metaphors that are generally apt and sensuous, doing double duty for mood and world rules. Rhythm is varied and the paragraphs are well-shaped, avoiding obvious loops or scaffolding; almost every sentence adds either image, lore, or emotional charge. There is some risk of purple prose through frequent figurative language and intensifiers (“insatiably creative,” “radiant hush,” “nameless color of wonder”), but coherence and clarity are preserved, especially at the ending. The final sentences land cleanly and do not suffer from figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory detail and metaphors that are largely coherent and apt (“jellyfish made of starlight,” “interlaced hush”). Sentences vary in length and structure, and most lines do multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening atmosphere, and reinforcing theme simultaneously. Figurative density is high but rarely tips into muddle or redundancy; there are few, if any, true scaffold or paraphrase loops. A slightly leaner choice of images at one or two points could prevent any risk of purple, but this is publication-ready line work.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, evocative metaphors, and high information density—many lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme at once. Key images (peeling frescoes “like old skin,” water stains as continents, thumb-oil coordinates) are striking and coherent rather than mixed. There is some risk of over-lyricism, but repetition and patterning feel intentional rather than scaffolded or redundant. Momentum is sustained despite the contemplative mode, and no obvious artifacts, loops, or syntactic glitches mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and multipurpose, and images like the infinite regression of snow globes are striking and precise. The prose sustains momentum despite its lyricism, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Some repetitions around “transformation,” “frequency,” and “nothing truly disappears” edge toward thematic reiteration and faint purple, slightly dulling the peak beats. Overall, though, clarity and cadence remain high, and there are no damaging artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally tight, rhythm varies, and images often do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; metaphors of prayer, bloom, and code interlock rather than clash. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. Some lines approach purple (e.g., “loneliness deeper than code, older than the archive itself”), but they don’t materially blur sense or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean and purposeful, with vivid metaphors that usually sharpen rather than blur (“ice cracking from its cables like breaking bones,” “ice crystals danced…like suspended grief”). The paragraphing and rhythm support forward momentum as the floors tick by, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition beyond the intentional structural count. Some lines verge on purple or redundant in the final thematic summation, and a few abstractions could be trimmed without loss. Nonetheless, clarity and propulsion are consistently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and rhythmic, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned (“clouds drift past like thoughts made visible”; “architecture of water vapor and wind”), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There are a few repeated constructions and coined phrases, but they work more as motif than artifact and do not slow momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final lines land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly economical, and often do double duty advancing both image and theme. Metaphors—“cathedral of knowledge,” “space between touching and knowing”—are apt and not overstacked to the point of muddle. There are a few near-repetitions and slightly purple abstractions toward the end that soften impact (“truth that some things could only be seen by those who couldn’t see”), but they don’t obscure closure. Overall momentum and clarity are well maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is controlled and often striking (“migrations of light and shadow,” “suspended between the obvious and the invisible”), with high information density and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and most metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (light, patterns, maps, games). Sentences generally carry multiple loads—worldbuilding, character, and theme—without bogging momentum. Minor tendencies toward explicit thematic statement prevent it from reaching the very top band, but line-level craft is easily at a competitive-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, dense with imagery, and generally avoids redundancy; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, emotion, or theme) without obvious scaffolding. Metaphors (cathedral of ice, memories in mirrors, driftwood prophecy scraps) are consistent and legible rather than mixed or overwrought. While the language is rich, it stops short of purple prose and maintains clarity and momentum through the reflective passages. A touch more spareness or variation during key realization beats could heighten impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, fluent, and efficient, often doing multiple jobs per sentence (advancing worldbuilding and emotional charge together). Metaphors like “blight…like despair made visible” and “brambled hope took root” are apt and not overstacked, and sentence rhythm varies pleasantly. There are no visible scaffold loops or syntactic tics that drag momentum, and the final image of the bell at the fountain under the arches is crisp and memorable. Occasional sentimentality edges close to the surface, but it doesn’t materially blur clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, dense with metaphor yet generally clear, and most sentences perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). There are no notable scaffolding loops or syntactic monotony; the piece reads smoothly aloud and builds momentum toward the climax in the lamp room. However, the figurative density verges on purple in places, with multiple metaphors stacked in some sentences, which slightly dilutes impact and risks over-saturation. Because clarity at closure remains intact, this is a minor rather than structural issue.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and character. Metaphors (e.g., “graceless beauty of someone who’d learned efficiency over elegance”) are apt and not over-stacked, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. Syntax varies enough to keep the line-level lively without drawing attention to itself. There are no noticeable artifacts or muddled images that obscure causality or the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythmic control and multi-functional sentences that carry image, emotion, and theme at once. Metaphors are mostly coherent and integrated (foam as temporary polymer chains, ravine as neural pathways, music as structure), avoiding mixed imagery despite their density. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold; each paragraph advances the emotional and conceptual arc. The only limitation is that the figurative load approaches saturation in places, risking slight overrichness even though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally tight, imagistic, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Metaphors are mostly clean and thematically aligned (glass, light, clouds, gaps), and there’s little to no scaffold, redundancy, or syntactic monotony. A handful of lines verge on the ornate, but they don’t blur causality or the closure image. Line-level craft meets a high literary standard and would need only minimal polishing for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and thematically apt (culinary, geological, ceramic), with few if any mixed metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or synonym loops that drag momentum. A slight tendency to stack abstractions (“stored remorse,” “digested grief of ages”) in the closing movement keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and high information density; most lines do more than one job (world, mood, and theme together). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent with the story’s sonic/time motifs. There are no significant loops, scaffolding phrases, or muddled metaphors to drag momentum or clarity, and grammar/punctuation are clean. A slight tendency toward lofty phrasing in the final thematic assertions is the only notable softness.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, character) and the rhythm suits a contemplative, visionary scene. Figurative language is mostly coherent and purposeful, with motifs (helix, spirals, fossils, libraries) returning in controlled ways. There are moments of density where metaphors and abstractions stack (“taxonomies of human hope and dread,” “language of fossilized ambition”), risking a touch of purple. Still, clarity and momentum survive, and there are no serious loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong images (“water droplets fell upward like silver rain,” “the fossilized throat of something vast and sleeping”) that do multiple jobs at once. Sentence variety and paragraphing keep momentum, and there’s little evident scaffolding or redundancy. A few metaphors border on density, but they don’t muddle sense or slow the line. This is solidly publishable line-level work, even if it doesn’t consistently leap into the extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“bark scarred with stress cracks from decades of silent screaming”). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to feel purple, and metaphors are on-theme and coherent. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase; the prose tends to move purposefully from image to image. A few conceptual restatements (explaining the cracks and the insulator’s properties) could be trimmed, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, or character plus atmosphere). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and internally consistent, with few if any mixed metaphors. There is minor redundancy in thematic statements and a tendency to explain what images have already implied, but no serious loops or artifacts that impede momentum or clarity. The closing image is clear and well-placed, reactivating earlier motifs without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences do double duty in advancing atmosphere and character, and imagery tends to be clear and apt (“smelled of lavender and gunpowder” is especially strong). Rhythm varies well, with longer descriptive lines balanced by more direct action beats as she tunes and adjusts. There is a mild tendency toward lushness and reiterated formulations about silence and resonance, but it stops short of purple or redundant. No significant scaffolding, loops, or figurative muddle interfere with clarity or momentum, including at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structure, high information density, and sensory specificity doing multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is generally apt and clear, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn; the narrative moves forward smoothly. A couple of images and phrases feel somewhat familiar, but they don’t meaningfully obscure or slow the piece. Overall, line-level craft is above-average and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, vivid, and well-paced, with strong images like rivers flowing skyward and trees rooted on every surface of a spherical grove. Sentences do more than one job—advancing setting, mood, and concept without excessive clutter—and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Occasionally the language edges toward the generic or explanatory, especially in the final didactic lines, which slightly dull the otherwise sharp imagery. Rhythm and clarity hold throughout, making the piece easy to follow and pleasant to read aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is clean, concise, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information. Metaphors (“metallic canyons,” containers as steel flowers) are apt and not over-stacked, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm from feeling mechanical. Information flows clearly; complex ideas like “wind speeds of zero and infinity simultaneously” are handled without muddle. It’s strong, publishable prose, if not yet stylistically singular.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and typically do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character filter) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but thematically controlled around sound/light/silence, avoiding incoherence or mixed metaphors. A few passages flirt with purple (“museum of silence transforming into a cathedral of sensation”), yet they remain clear and on-theme rather than muddy. There is strong momentum for a lyric piece, with no significant redundancy or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and economical; most sentences do more than one job, combining atmosphere, worldbuilding, and character interiority with minimal redundancy. Metaphors are generally apt and coherent (tide versus threshold, mountains “holding breath,” flute as “choreographer’s baton”), and there are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony. A few lines edge toward over-explanation or slightly purple metaphor (“insights began to flow—not the chaotic whispers... but structured knowledge”) but they don’t materially drag momentum or obscure cause and effect. Overall rhythm and clarity would be publishable with only light trimming for maximal concision.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense, and often do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, character, and theme), and rhythm generally flows smoothly. Imagery such as “reading seventeen different texts printed on transparent sheets stacked atop each other” is both precise and thematically resonant. There is an ongoing risk of over-ornamentation—metaphors and abstractions are frequent enough that a few moments feel slightly saturated—but clarity is never seriously compromised and the closing image remains sharp. I see no major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle that would materially dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs, vivid but controlled metaphors, and generally high information density—most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus character, or image plus theme). Figurative language mostly coheres around light, resonance, and seeds/blooming, avoiding mixed-metaphor clutter. There are a few mildly expository or redundant phrases (“Her role as a courier would never be routine again”) that tell what the images already imply, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure closure. Syntax and paragraphing support a smooth, propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“Light fractured into colors that shouldn’t exist—not rainbow spectrums, but emotional wavelengths…”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddled or mixed metaphors. There is slight redundancy in reasserting the world-shaking importance of the discovery, and a few lines tilt toward purple or over-explanatory, but they do not significantly drag momentum. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor trims needed for absolute top-tier concision.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level writing is strong, with high information density and largely purposeful figurative language that ties back to weaving and fabric metaphors. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and paragraphs move the story forward without scaffolding or obvious synonym loops. There’s a mild risk of over-enrichment—several metaphors (tapestry, raveling, loom, silence) cluster—but they stay coherent within the chosen motif. The prose is polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening possible for taste, not necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Phrases like “metal remembered everything” and “cherry blossoms fell upward through the floating stones” are vivid without feeling overwrought. There is some density of figurative language and abstract phrasing in places, but it rarely clogs momentum or clarity. I see little redundancy or scaffolding; most sentences earn their keep.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and mostly tight, with varied sentence rhythms and strong, concrete images; the synesthetic translations are inventive without becoming incoherent. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and nearly every sentence adds either world texture or forward motion. A few formulations (“cyclically throughout her life,” “unraveling at the quantum level”) feel more generic/scientific than the surrounding lyricism, slightly diluting intensity. Overall, though, momentum holds and the final paragraphs land clearly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied in length, and efficient, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors like “dead eye a wound in the star-scattered sky” and “stairs seemed to breathe” are vivid without crowding the page. There are no noticeable repetition loops or scaffolding sentences; information density is high and momentum steady. A few theme-forward lines could be trimmed for maximal sharpness, but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are often fresh (“storms from futures that hadn’t decided whether to exist”), and most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and motion). Figurative language is dense but largely controlled; there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding and no major metaphor muddle. The prose sustains momentum even in descriptive passages, with clear sequencing and clean syntax. A hair below the very top tier because the density occasionally approaches ornamentation more than pressure, though it never quite tips over.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong verbs, varied sentence structure, and high information density; most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion or theme). Some metaphoric clusters verge on ornate, but they generally cohere and don’t obscure sense or momentum. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or template cadence, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. A slight tendency toward stacked abstractions in thematic sentences keeps this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and usually do double duty (advancing both scene and theme), with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Imagery—“growth rings,” “calculations older than numbers,” “map the space between loss and understanding”—is fresh and largely consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overkill. A few sentences compress complex ideas into slightly glib formulae (“In moonlight, everything heals—not back to what was, but forward to what might be”), which softens impact and edges toward aphorism. Overall, though, momentum holds and rhythm supports the emotional arc, well within publishable range.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and metaphors like “broken necklace” and “poorly-knitted shroud” are apt and coherent. The prose occasionally approaches purple, but density remains mostly purposeful and doesn’t obscure causality or image. There are no evident loops, filler scaffolding, or syntactic monotony. A small trim of explicit thematic statements could sharpen impact, but as-is, the language would be competitive in high-end venues.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense; most lines do double duty for mood and character without padding. Occasional familiar phrases (“the library seemed to hold its breath”) are more conventional than fresh but don’t significantly drag. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax follows emotional tempo effectively, especially around the empathic shock and the final expansion of quiet. Overall, the prose reads polished enough for high-tier venues with only minor opportunities for sharper, less expository phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences carry image, mood, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy; lines like “tea that tasted of future rain” are evocative without being muddled. A few phrases lean into conceptual abstraction or near-platitude, slightly dulling the sharpness of some images, but not enough to seriously harm momentum or clarity. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, economical for its lyricism, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; images like “clouds that never moved” and “quartz hush” are vivid without becoming overwrought. Sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without bogging momentum, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is consistent in imagery (ice, light, cold, vows as luminosity) rather than scattershot. The climax and closing lines remain clear and uncluttered despite the elevated style.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are tight, varied, and information-dense, with few if any redundant loops or scaffolding phrases. Imagery is generally sharp and specific, and while metaphor density is high in places, it doesn’t tip into incoherence or purple excess. Transitions between action, thought, and description are smooth, maintaining momentum even during brief expository clarifications. The prose would need only light polishing to be publication-ready at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and imaginative, sensorial metaphors (e.g., “tasting copper-sweet magnetic north,” “bark-pattern fractals, coordinates written in xylem flow rates”). Rhythm and sentence variety are good, and there is little outright redundancy. However, figurative language is almost constant, flirting with purple and occasionally feeling layered for its own sake (“terrestrially cosmic,” “futuristic nostalgia”) rather than strictly serving pressure or clarity. Despite this ornamental tilt, clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually pull double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is mostly apt and integrated, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few phrases lean toward cliché or overstatement (“chest cracked open with understanding,” “museum of her perfect memory”) and thematic restatement in the last paragraphs slightly blunts impact. Even so, rhythm and clarity are maintained throughout with no serious artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, purposeful, and dense with information, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases, and the rhythm shifts naturally between exposition and heightened moments. Imagery is occasionally a bit on-the-nose thematically but remains clear and rarely overburdened; metaphors are consistent with the world’s logic. Nothing in the final movement is dulled or obscured by purple prose or structural artifacts, which keeps the closure clean.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences have varied structure, strong verbs, and high information density, often doing atmospheric and narrative work at once. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and patterned (colors and sound as frequencies, light that “didn’t exist”), supporting the speculative conceit rather than muddling it. There are very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases; momentum is steady despite the reflective, low-action mode. The lushness comes close to excess in spots, but clarity and propulsion remain intact through the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (world, emotion, theme) and maintain forward motion. Imagery—miniature suns, wings of flame folding inward, roots pulsing with “almost like blood”—is vivid without tipping into incoherent purple. There is some repetition (e.g., “strangely organic”) and a few explanatory lines that could be trimmed, but they don’t significantly sap momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with varied rhythm that supports the contemplative yet pressured mood.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich, and varied in rhythm; lines often carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, and theme in one). There are no significant clarity issues or clunky scaffolds, and repetitions like “locked” and “letters” are purposeful. The primary weakness is occasional thematic overstatement and slightly purple abstractions (“sandstorm calm,” “until the locked became open”) that announce meaning rather than letting it resonate, but they don’t materially blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with most doing multiple jobs (advancing action, revealing character, and sustaining atmosphere). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A handful of formulations (“smelling of memories she’d never lived,” “not through force or cleverness”) tilt toward familiar lyricism and mild purple, but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum. The closing paragraphs in particular are tight and well-paced.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and dense with information, with images like ashes drifting “like snow” or vials of visible memories doing double duty for world and emotion. Figurative language is controlled rather than piled on, and there are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates dulling momentum. The final paragraphs braid earlier motifs (salt, flowers, gravity, lanterns) into a clear, resonant image without confusion. A few abstract phrases (“impact on reality”) are less sharp than the surrounding prose but do not materially hurt clarity or cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level writing is polished, with high information density and images that typically do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Metaphoric language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful rather than ornamental, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth flow from incantatory to concrete without losing clarity, including at the closure image. At times the lushness verges on over-rich, but it does not obscure cause/effect or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: images like “meteors traced silver threads across darkness” and the building adjusting “its weight like an old man” are vivid without becoming purple. Most lines perform multiple functions (characterization, setting, theme) and there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. A few abstract statements slightly dilute the otherwise image-led momentum, but they do not obscure clarity or closure. Overall, the prose shows above-market control and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and typically do double duty (advancing both atmosphere and interiority). Metaphors are mostly apt and thematically cohesive (light, resonance, architecture), with relatively few mixed or overwrought moments. There is some density of figurative language and a couple of near-redundant thematic restatements, which slightly blunt momentum. Overall, though, the prose remains lucid and propulsive, supporting rather than smothering the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied enough in length, and typically do double duty in advancing both mood and meaning. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with only a few borderline-purple turns and minor redundancy (“pearl twilight” and aurora imagery are repeated but thematically motivated). There is little to no scaffolding, exposition is economical, and momentum is maintained despite reflective density. A sharper pruning of a few near-synonymous phrases and overt thematic lines could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level writing is polished, with strong, mostly clean metaphors (“layered like sediment,” “canyon walls…catching starlight like scales”) and good information density—most sentences do at least two jobs. There’s little scaffolding or redundant paraphrase, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. The prose occasionally leans toward lush, with a few near-abstract phrasings (“web of intrigue,” “universe’s secret song”) that tell rather than show, but they don’t seriously obscure clarity or dull the ending image. Overall, craft is clearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and plot. Figurative language (“caught candlelight like borrowed starlight”) is vivid and generally coherent with the story’s imagery system. There is some risk of purple prose and thematic restatement in the closing stretch, but it doesn’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity. No noticeable scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony interfere with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing atmospheric, thematic, and character work simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and legible (“each knot a small rebellion against entropy,” “living sparks that traced their ancient routes”). A few phrases tilt slightly purple or self-conscious (“scintillatingly somber rhythm,” “invisible architecture of effort”), but they don’t obscure sense or clog momentum. There is little redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is clean, with strong information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, plot, or theme. Phrasing like “a flaw running through its heart like a crack in reality itself” is vivid without tipping into purple, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Sentence rhythm varies well, and syntax remains clear even in expository passages about the letters and project. Occasional on-the-nose formulations slightly dull the edge, but there are no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors to undercut momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty as worldbuilding and mood. Some metaphor stacking (“his influence unfurling like smoke through history’s lungs,” “reality’s origami creases smoothing and reforming”) edges toward purple but generally maintains coherence. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases; momentum is preserved despite lyric density. A bit more variation between lush description and sharp, concrete beats could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and high in information density—most sentences carry character, setting, and theme at once. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and apt, with only occasional borderline-purple moments that don’t obstruct clarity. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic tics, and action/sequence remains easy to follow. Slight sentimentality in a few lines affects tonal sharpness more than line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean for its lyricism, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“flesh could become a tuning fork, bone could conduct the sacred songs”). Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and thematically aligned—sound, light, bone, and ice recur purposefully rather than as random ornament. There are minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; the narrative moves forward with each paragraph. A touch of purple (“electronic hunger,” “wings of forgotten birds”) flirts with overrichness but doesn’t obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, precise verbs, and metaphors that mostly cohere (water, ice, stone, tides, songs) and do multiple jobs at once. Information density is high with little scaffolding, and the prose maintains clarity even while carrying worldbuilding and theme. There is some mild repetitiveness in the explicit statements about patience and revolution, but it does not meaningfully drag momentum or obscure closure. Overall, the lines are polished and publication-ready with only small opportunities to trim thematic reiteration.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean and purposeful, with varied rhythm and a good balance of concrete image and conceptual framing; there are few, if any, genuine artifacts or confusing lines. The piece maintains momentum despite reflective passages, largely avoiding paraphrase loops or clotted metaphors. That said, some lines cluster abstractions (“modern bondage—abusive relationships, soul-crushing jobs, systematic oppression”) in a way that feels more like gloss than lived perception, slightly dulling intensity. Tightening those summary phrases into more specific, scene-rooted detail would sharpen the prose further.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a consistent ear for image (“vibrant hush,” “calm before realization,” “gears smaller than rice grains”). Most lines do double duty—advancing scene and deepening mood—with little obvious scaffolding or repetition. At times the figurative language clusters (multiple storm/light and music/heart parallels) verge on ornamental and risk softening the climax’s sharpness. Still, clarity is never sacrificed, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid metaphors, good sentence variety, and high information density; most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and theme simultaneously. Recurrent constructions like “transliterating X into Y” verge on overuse, and some abstractions (“dimensions of meaning,” “evolution of consciousness itself”) are less sharp than the more concrete acid-and-brass imagery. Still, the prose remains clear, and purple tendencies do not obscure causality or the closure image. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the final images of equations in the toxic sky and “irreverent awe” land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, character, and concept) without padding. Metaphoric language around ghosts, static, and compression is coherent and not overstacked. A few expository compressions (“Lila pulled up seventeen months of missing person reports…”) summarize potentially dramatic beats, flattening momentum slightly. There are no major loops, artifacts, or figurative muddles that obscure sense, especially at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is smooth, and imagery is often striking without becoming overwrought (“its surface reflecting not light but possibility”). Most lines do double duty—advancing both world and theme—maintaining momentum despite the meditative tone. Some repetition of abstract terms (empathy, understanding, peace) and explicit thesis statements slightly dilute intensity, but there are no major loops or muddled metaphors. The final paragraphs land clean, clear images that carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and vivid figurative language that usually carries multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme). Images like “drift-ice marina…each bobbing floe a temporary headstone” and “paper cranes returning to flat sheets” are precise and resonant. There is a mild risk of figurative over-saturation in places, with several high-concept metaphors in close proximity, but they remain coherent and rarely feel mixed or redundant. Momentum holds throughout; there is little scaffolding or paraphrase-looping.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and mostly economical, with images like “last light like honey crystallizing in air” and “wine that sommeliers couldn’t classify but couldn’t deny” doing double duty as atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined, rarely feeling strained or mixed. There’s minimal redundancy, and sentences advance character or mood rather than spinning in place. A few lines edge toward purple or on-the-nose, but they don’t materially blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is mostly tight, image-rich, and purposeful; phrases like “murmuring pavilion,” “maps of light,” and “a sound like wind through infinite pages” are evocative without collapsing into purple. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition that feels like filler. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically aligned with knowledge and boundaries, and it doesn’t obscure action. A touch more pruning of repeated abstract formulations (“wisdom echoes,” “truth nonetheless”) could sharpen the highest-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and economical, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme (“leather worn smooth as river stones,” “bodies choosing, again and again, to bend toward each other rather than break alone”). Sentence rhythm varies well, and there are few, if any, genuine loops or scaffolding artifacts. The main weakness is a tendency toward stacked metaphors and near-platitudinous phrasing in the closing movement, which slightly blurs sharpness in favor of uplift. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the language would be competitive in high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and high information density; most sentences do more than one job (image, worldbuilding, and character). Figurative language is generally fresh and thematically apt, especially the garden and prism imagery. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffold or synonym loops; rhythm suits the meditative, accumulative mode. A few phrases (“sealed it in digital amber,” “perfect taxonomy”) lean toward familiar conceptual metaphors, but they don’t obscure meaning or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple jobs (image, theme, action), and maintain clarity despite lyric density. Metaphors (fog as memory, tapes as preserved lives, chalk as years) are coherent and not over-mixed. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line feels purposeful. A few moments verge on lush, but they don’t bog momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and efficient, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“Each revolution created a tiny temporal eddy…”). Figurative language is generally fresh and controlled; images like “luminous ache” and “leaf-fall song” enhance rather than obscure sense. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or muddled metaphors, and the prose maintains momentum. A few abstractions verge on the poetic-general, but they don’t significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally multitask (character, setting, and theme often move together). Figurative language—“pulsing stillness,” “the scent of hope,” the record reflecting her split self—is vivid without being overwrought, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts. Momentum holds well for a reflective piece; nearly every line earns its place. A few phrases tilt toward sentimentality, but not enough to dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, advancing plot, hinting theme). Figurative language is purposeful rather than over-stacked, and there are no significant paraphrase loops or template cadences. Key beats—like the automaton writing backwards and the shadows’ “noon refuge”—are rendered with clarity and concision. A touch more variance in sentence structure at peak-pressure moments could sharpen propulsion, but there are no notable artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in structure, information density is high, and metaphors (bones as architecture, spaces holding magic; nests and spider silk) are mostly apt and layered. There are no significant loops, scaffold phrases, or clarity issues, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. A few lines land close to familiar aphorism (“mercy and cruelty often shared the same garden path,” “stars waiting to form constellations”), slightly dulling their impact compared to more original images elsewhere. Overall, the writing is polished and publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences carry atmosphere and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and legible, with only occasional strain (“zephyr bloom of dawn”) and no mixed-metaphor confusion. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax stays clear even in more descriptive runs. A slight tendency toward purple in low-pressure moments keeps it just below top-tier line work.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Recurrent images (moss, servers, ice rings, the pendant) are handled without muddle, and metaphor stays coherent to the nature/tech reclamation frame. There is minor repetition and a faint tendency to explain what imagery already implies (the “quiet revolution” line is close to thesis-stating), but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. Overall, line-level craft would need very little trimming for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are precise, metaphors mostly clean, and almost every line advances either atmosphere, character, or theme. The rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. At times the density of figurative language approaches lushness, but it remains controlled and does not obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful imagery (“bruised with night’s departure,” “cathedral of green shadow”). Sentences generally do multiple jobs—advancing scene, mood, and theme simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. That said, figurative language and elevated diction are nearly constant, risking mild purple excess and leaving little room for sharper, plainer beats that might heighten contrast and impact. Line-level control is strong but not yet at the austere precision typical of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are precise, imagistic, and generally do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, mood, and action). The figurative language is dense but coherent and thematically aligned (light, inversion, heartbeats, mapping), avoiding mixed metaphors or obvious purple excess. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase; most lines move the scene or deepen the atmosphere. A touch more variation in texture—occasionally plainer phrasing under “peak” moments—could sharpen contrast further, but as-is it’s publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are precise (“veins of quartz…like frozen lightning,” “camera obscura” effect), and most lines do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language is frequent but not over-stacked, and it generally clarifies rather than blurs. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; exposition is compressed efficiently through image. A handful of thematic statements tilt toward abstraction, but they don’t materially slow momentum or obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: metaphor selection is coherent (weight, geometry, bone, bronze), sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) with little scaffolding, and there are no significant loops or clarity issues. The “shingled hush” and similar phrases recur as purposeful motifs, not artifacts, and the final image of “seventeen grams, plus the weight of starlight on bronze” is precise and striking. There is a slight risk of purple density—nearly every sentence is figurative—which may tire some readers and occasionally blurs urgency. Still, rhythm, variety, and precision are strong enough that the lushness mostly feels controlled rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, economical, and often do double duty by advancing action and deepening theme (“She carved the clock's outer ring, thinking of circus rings, wedding rings, the circles that contain a life”). Figurative language is selective and coherent, with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm tightens as the kettle nears its boil. There are a few slightly expository lines about lessons and presence, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences multitask by advancing setting, mood, and character simultaneously (“The ambitions of the builders had eroded not through failure but through success…” is a good example). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (erosion, rust, perpetual motion vs. stillness), without falling into mixed metaphor or purple excess. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding, and the final lines land with clarity and resonance. A touch more syntactic variety in a few mid-paragraph stretches could add even more propulsion, but the line-level craft is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: clear syntax, good information density, and vivid, economical images (“water arced in precise parabolas”). There is some conceptual and lexical repetition around “hope,” “intention,” and “equations,” but it doesn’t seriously bog momentum. Figurative language is controlled and mostly apt, with no mixed metaphors or purple overreach. The main limitation is a tendency toward expository summarizing in the thematic passages rather than letting images fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and a good balance between sensory detail and narrative progression. Sentences generally do multiple jobs at once (setting mood, revealing character, advancing the decision), and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or repetition. A few phrases flirt with purple or abstracted metaphor, but they remain intelligible and in character. Rhythm and paragraphing support the quiet, accumulative build without dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and purposeful, with several striking images and no major grammatical or clarity issues. Information density is high, with most lines doing double duty for character, theme, and atmosphere. Some repetitions of core phrases and thematic abstractions create a mild sense of overstatement near the end, but momentum and clarity largely hold.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and economical for its density: images like “each flake dissolving into the weathered planks” and the fulgurite’s branching interior do multiple jobs (setting, theme, character) without apparent padding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with no mixed metaphors or muddled comparisons, and line-level clarity remains high. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, charged image. Rhythm reads smoothly aloud and supports the quiet, accumulating pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, dense but mostly efficient imagery, and few if any genuine redundancies; many sentences do double duty for setting and emotion. Metaphors (“souls halfway to wherever souls go,” “absence now a kind of presence”) are generally clean and apt. There is a slight tendency toward purple or over-articulated theme in a few lines, but it doesn’t significantly impede clarity or momentum. The final paragraphs land with a clear, resonant image rather than getting lost in abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with dense, multi-tasking sentences that build atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (“The mechanical world below had forgotten that mathematics could be poetry…”). Rhythm varies well, and there are few if any genuine scaffolding or paraphrase loops. At times the figurative language flirts with purple or redundancy (“suspended within the suspended palace—a dream within a dream”), but it doesn’t obscure clarity or closure. Tightening a handful of stacked metaphors and reiterated descriptors would lift it further into truly standout line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most images do at least double duty (emotional, thematic, and sensory). The prose sustains a lyrical register without major clarity loss, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few constructions edge into purple or slightly repetitive thematic phrasing (“burning times,” “from ending comes beginning,” explicit moral tags about compassion), softening impact. Nonetheless, the closing cadence is clean and the imagery remains legible and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and imagistic yet generally precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs: advancing concept, atmosphere, and character outlook at once. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors like “accumulated time, thick and viscous as amber” are clear and apt. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the closing images reweigh earlier motifs efficiently. At times the lyricism verges on lushness that slightly softens pressure, but it doesn’t obstruct clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and rarely redundant; metaphors are generally precise and harmonious with the conceit. There’s very little scaffolding or looped phrasing, and the rhythm supports the contemplative mode without dragging. A few images edge toward familiar cosmic-poetic territory, but not enough to feel purple or to dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with strong image choices (“iron bones black against the salmon sky”) and a good balance between lyric description and forward movement. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly every line is doing multiple jobs (world-building, character, theme) without visible scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is controlled and coherent across motifs (grain, weaving, migration) without sliding into purple or muddled metaphor. There are no noticeable artifacts, loops, or clarity problems at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, specific nouns, and an effective mix of long, flowing sentences with shorter emphatic ones. Figurative language generally clarifies instead of obscuring, and repetition (ticks, seconds, swings) feels patterned rather than accidental. There are a few slightly purple or redundant phrases and some explanatory clauses that could be tightened. Still, momentum and clarity remain high, with no significant scaffolding or looping.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically aware, and information-dense without obvious padding or loops. Metaphors are mostly clean and thematically aligned (e.g., “velveteen gloom,” “sound like distant applause”), with only mild risk of over-ornamentation in a few spots. The prose maintains clarity despite its lushness, and transitions between reflection and present action are smooth. A touch more sharpness—paring one or two explicit explanatory lines—would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and generally dense without becoming purple; many sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) at once. Metaphors are mostly clean and aligned with the story’s conceptual core—maps, voids, currents, riverbeds—building a coherent figurative network. There is some abstraction and mild repetition in the back half (e.g., reiterating the system-vs-innovation thesis) that slightly flattens momentum. Still, there are no significant artifacts, loops, or muddled images, and the closing cadence lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and character) at once. Figurative language (“teaching dust to tell stories again,” “thistled calm”) is fresh and largely controlled, rarely tipping into purple. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum is maintained despite a reflective, lyric mode. A few abstractions could be pared back, but they don’t significantly obscure or slow the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is tight and image-rich, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, character, and theme together. Standout phrases like “each grain fell exactly where she intended” and “every emotion, when truly crystallized, carried its own weight” feel carefully honed without tipping into purple. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; paragraphs progress with clear momentum toward the final reweighting. The only notable limitation is a slight tendency to state theme directly in a couple of lines, which marginally blunts the otherwise excellent subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with images like “barnacles creep across marble statues through green-tinted water” doing multiple jobs at once. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors, and exposition is kept tight. A few abstractions (“competing narratives trying to explain,” “rational rebellion”) slightly thin the immediacy but not enough to damage momentum or clarity. With a few more surprising, character-specific turns of phrase at peak beats, this could edge into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and cadence, images pull double duty thematically and sensorially, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are largely coherent and context-appropriate (autumn leaves, cranes, traveled stillness), giving the prose a unified texture without tipping into purple. Information density is high—backstory and philosophy are compressed efficiently into a small number of lines—and the piece maintains momentum despite being reflective. A few moments edge toward aphoristic neatness, but they do not materially blur clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“rust bloomed into patterns that looked like constellation maps of synapses”). Figurative language is mostly controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess despite the lyrical premise. A few explanatory or slightly stock phrases (“They think they’ve won”; some spelled-out neuroscience) soften the impact but don’t significantly drag momentum. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts, and the final paragraphs land with strong, clear images.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong image-to-information density—most lines advance both mood and story. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful; metaphors (bees as kingdom-builders, drones as “broken promises”) are coherent and not over-mixed. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the final paragraph efficiently braids object, light, and theme. A few aphoristic lines flirt with overtness, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax and strong information density—most sentences do at least two jobs (setting tone, advancing concept, revealing character). Figurative language is generally apt and legible, and there are few if any outright mixed metaphors or clunky constructions. There is some tendency toward stacking abstractions (“burning away the day’s accumulated noise like fever burning infection,” “slow, sacred transformation”) which skirts the edge of purple but doesn’t quite tip into muddle or drag momentum. Overall, line-level craft comfortably meets elite-publication standards, even if a small tightening of repeated “understood”/“sanctifications” phrasing would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with many sentences pulling double duty for atmosphere and character (“drowned garden,” “eternal sentinel,” “captured sunset”). Rhythm varies well, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; the piece moves efficiently from image to action to realization. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned, especially around threads, structural weakness, and color. The final paragraphs lean slightly into abstract summation, which softens the sharpness of the closing image, but not enough to seriously blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally concise yet layered, with minimal redundancy and strong information density (“the safest choice was often the most dangerous illusion” reframes both his past and present in one stroke). Figurative language is used judiciously and tends to clarify rather than blur, and there are no obvious loops, scaffold phrases, or mechanical cadence issues. The pacing of paragraphs tracks well with conceptual turns, sustaining momentum in a story that could easily have felt static. Occasional high-register phrases flirt with abstraction, but they don’t materially obscure sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, mostly lean despite its lyricism, and sentences often do double duty—advancing action while also reinforcing theme or mood (e.g., scripts described as “dots like seeds waiting to sprout”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, with no mixed metaphors that jar or obscure sense. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph adds new information or reweights prior images. Slight purple-tinged tendencies (“saffron hours,” “whispers of lost languages in the steam”) keep it just below the very top band, but the line-level craft is still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with metaphor and image generally doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Phrases like “alphabet of belonging etched in carbon and flour dust” are vivid yet legible, and the rosewater/waterfall motifs recur with purpose rather than as ornament. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold; almost every sentence advances setting, stakes, or theme. A few more abstract formulations (“tomb of culture”) slightly soften the otherwise sharp imagistic texture, but not enough to dent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clear sequencing, and images that generally pull their weight without redundancy. Metaphors like “tide pulled away...like a dying breath” and “a sound like time itself cracking” are vivid yet coherent within the established logic. There’s mild density of figurative language, but it rarely tips into purple or muddles clarity, and there are few if any obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The prose sustains momentum and clarity through the high-pressure beats and lands a clean final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is vivid, leaner than its lushness implies, and frequently multi-functional—sentences often carry setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors are striking yet mostly coherent with the story’s biology/decay/photography palette, and rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraph flow alive. There is some flirtation with purple prose (“understanding flooding through her like formaldehyde,” “repulsive allure”), but it suits the chosen mode and rarely muddies clarity or momentum. I see minimal scaffolding or repetitive phrasing; nearly every line earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, imagistically rich, and doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and motion) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and logically coherent, with motifs like resonance, spirals, and music reinforcing each other rather than clashing. There are minor hints of purple density—several metaphors stacked in close succession—but they rarely obstruct clarity or pacing. The climax reads cleanly, with cause and effect legible despite the lyrical overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lean yet evocative, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood while maintaining clarity. Figurative language is controlled and rarely over-stacked; phrases like “its light washing everything in pale gold that couldn't quite hide the spreading cracks” efficiently carry tone and plot. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics that drag momentum. A few lines edge toward familiar formulation, but overall line-level craft is strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and precise, with several strong images (“crimson against the rusted tracks,” the letter “glowing with purpose”). Sentences carry multiple functions—advancing plot, character, and atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few lines veer toward aphoristic theme statements, but they don’t muddy clarity or pacing. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready, if more controlled and polished than stylistically daring.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, with varied openings and a good balance of concrete detail and metaphor (“ink as black as the space between memories” is emblematic). Description usually does multiple jobs at once—advancing setting, mood, and character—without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. While the prose sometimes brushes against the edge of purple, it remains coherent and purposeful, and momentum never stalls in ornament. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic glitches, or muddled images harming clarity, including at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with strong information density: most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and advancing action. Rhythm is varied and readable, and there is no major scaffolding or synonym-looping that drags momentum. A few phrases and constructions verge on the gently purple (“dappled resolve,” “reclaimed stillness”), but they remain coherent and on-theme rather than muddling sense. Line-level craft is publication-ready, if not yet dazzling enough for top-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density; most lines carry worldbuilding, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Imagery (“bridges of woven moonlight,” “luminous torment”) is vivid and mostly coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. There is a slight tendency toward purple or aphoristic phrasing in expository moments, but it doesn’t significantly bog momentum or clarity. No evident scaffolding, redundancy loops, or grammatical slips mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and information-dense; most lines do more than one job, moving plot while layering concept or emotion (“not with light but with possibility itself”). Repetition of key abstractions (“unused potential,” “pools,” “future”) feels intentional rather than like synonym churn, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled and usually apt, without purple drift or mixed metaphors muddying meaning. The prose stops short of exceptional distinctiveness, but it’s publish-ready at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and action), rhythm varies, and there are few if any genuine artifacts or redundancies. Some metaphors and phrases (“brilliant dimness,” “frequency of belonging”) approach the edge of purple or are repeated enough to feel slightly heavy-handed, but they don’t significantly blur clarity. Line-level momentum is good; each paragraph advances either the discovery process or Kira’s internal shift. Tightening a few explanatory lines and trimming minor repetition would bring it close to elite.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and concrete images that do multiple jobs. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned; it rarely tips into genuine purple prose. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and transitions between reflection and present action are clean. A few phrases (“museum of tempered regret,” “restless ghosts of their histories”) feel slightly writerly, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, clean syntax, and high information density with most lines doing multiple jobs (setting, theme, emotion at once). Imagery like “where empires met but never touched” and “furrowed hush” is vivid and generally coherent, and figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to obscure sense. There are no notable loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues, and the final paragraphs cadence nicely into the closing image. A few abstractions (“forces greater than politics or pride”) verge on generic, but they don’t materially blunt momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clear, mostly economical, and rhythmically varied, with strong images (waves eroding confidence, poles as constellation) doing double duty for setting and theme. There’s some repetition around “broken things” and “backlash of regrets,” and a couple of metaphors are on-the-nose (“learning to swim in shallower water”), softening the emotional edge. Still, there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn, and sentences usually advance multiple layers at once. Line-level craft is solidly above average but not yet at the razor-sharp precision of elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and purposeful, and figurative language (“cathedral of stone,” “pressed flowers that refuse to crumble”) is evocative without tipping into purple excess. Most lines do at least two jobs—advancing setting, mood, and theme simultaneously—which sustains momentum despite the lyricism. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or syntactic templates, and the final image is clean and charged. The density of metaphor comes close to saturation in places but remains coherent and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and multi-functional, with strong images like blossoms becoming scales/feathers/light and the blank fortune turning into a moth. Sentences carry both atmosphere and emotional movement without much redundancy or filler. A few phrases verge on familiar sentiment or near-platitude, especially in the reunion dialogue, which slightly dulls the edge of the climax. Overall line-level craft is publication-ready with only fine-tuning needed for maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with few redundancies, and key beats are rendered in concrete, memorable images. The prose’s density and metaphorical layering are ambitious but mostly coherent, avoiding muddled or mixed comparisons. There is mild risk of purple prose—clusters like “air that tasted of lilacs and lightning” plus “beauty…choking her” plus “more beautiful than bearable”—which can feel a touch over-saturated in close proximity. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained through the ending image, and scaffolding or repetition is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmically varied, and vivid; many sentences do double duty by advancing both worldbuilding and emotional stakes (e.g., the photographs’ tears shimmering under special lights). There is some tendency toward abstraction and elevated diction, especially in the closing paragraphs, but it stops short of purple and does not obscure sense. Repetition is purposeful rather than scaffolding, and there are no significant loops or syntactic templates that drag momentum. A bit more concrete, bodily texture at peak stress (e.g., what it physically feels like to endure that chorus of violence) could deepen impact, but line-level control is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished: strong, specific images, a good sense of cadence, and minimal redundancy or clutter. Metaphors are mostly coherent and apt, with a few memorable turns (“black sand becoming glass in volcanic fire,” “vibrant hush”). There is some density of figurative language and conceptual repetition (“texture of transformation”) verging on purple prose in places, but clarity remains intact. The prose could be tightened slightly by trusting images over paraphrased interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and dense with information, and figurative language (“like captured fire,” “death by a thousand paper cuts”) is mostly apt without overgrowth. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm supports a calm, conspiratorial atmosphere. Repetitions like “the cradle of sparks” read as deliberate motif rather than loop, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. The prose is very solid but not so razor-honed or surprising as to reach the topmost band for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and multi-purpose sentences that both worldbuild and advance the scene. Figurative language is frequent but generally clear and controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding lines. The explanatory middle (cosmic friction, grandmother’s choices) leans more on telling, slightly damping momentum but not obscuring sense or closure. Overall line-level craft is publication-ready, with only small opportunities to tighten exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and character in one move) and a strong ear for cadence; lines like “Each wound in the original manuscripts had become a doorway in her new work” are precise rather than bloated. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically unified around storms, stars, scars, and visibility/erasure. A few constructions edge toward over-saturation or explicitness (“applause from the universe itself,” the chains/mist sentence) and risk softening the impact by stating what the images imply. Nonetheless, momentum holds and clarity is never in doubt, with very little scaffold or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean choreography, and a good balance of image and abstraction. Phrases like “philosophical dueling” and “intellectual jazz” verge on conceptual branding but are supported by concrete staging, so they don’t read as empty. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; most lines carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, character, theme) without bogging momentum. A touch of purple flourish appears, yet it doesn’t obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid images (“liquid silver,” “book of broken books”), efficient syntactic variety, and good information density with minimal filler. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically aligned with fracture and reconstruction. There are occasional near-redundancies and slightly over-explicit lines that explain what the images already show, but they don’t significantly dampen momentum or obscure meaning. With a light trim for repetition and a bit more sharpness in a few abstractions, this would be publication-ready prose.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing double or triple duty in worldbuilding, mood, and character, and very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Some figurative density (“divining rods for regret,” “nightly invitation to darkness,” “stars…like perforations in film”) pushes toward lushness but remains coherent and purposeful rather than purple or confusing, so momentum is maintained through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Metaphors are inventive yet legible, and while the prose is lush, it mostly avoids purple overkill or confusing mixes; rhythm supports the contemplative pressure rather than bogging it down. There are no noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences, and the closing images (orchids reflecting stories, rain falling as the island remains) land clearly. A slight overabundance of explicitly abstract phrasing in the final paragraph keeps this just shy of outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple layers of work (setting, emotion, theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances mood or meaning. A few images verge on density, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished but leans on abstract descriptors ("unlikely corners," "profound truths") and summarized action. There are instances of "template cadence" in the montage sections ("She began visiting," "Elena started seeing"). The phrase "fractal patterns that echoed stellar formation" feels slightly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but leans on clichés ("canyon walls held their breath," "punctured by stars") and abstractions ("scorched testament"). The lyrical attempts occasionally obscure the moment with melodrama ("daily surrender to sunrise").

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but overwritten, relying on adjective-heavy abstraction ("visual music," "quiet fire") that softens the impact. The rhythm is smooth, but the density of flowery metaphors reduces the visceral immediacy of the Arctic setting.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong rhythmic control and evocative phrasing ("silence bloomed like funeral flowers"). However, the reliance on summary verbs and broad time jumps creates a distancing effect that prevents the prose from achieving high-density immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent and rhythmic but relies on "literary" clichés and abstract metaphors ("forgotten prayer," "benevolent shadows," "forged in darkness"). While the "amplified quiet" is well-placed, phrases like "silent marketplace of dignity" feel overwritten and slightly imprecise.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "purple" density ("ribbons of light... like silk scarves," "compressed starlight"). While technically sound, the reliance on flowery metaphors occasionally obscures the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe rhetorical tic—the "not X, but Y" construction—appears six times in this short space ("not trapped... but trapped by," "not smooth... but granular," "not violently, but gently," etc.). This repetitive template cadence creates a lecturing rhythm that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from lack of clarity in key action beats; the chain-breaking moment is physically unintelligible. Abstract phrasing ("impede the Authority's sterile tomorrow") replaces concrete description, and the pacing drags under the weight of explanatory thought processes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong sensory density ("hull splitting like overripe fruit"). There is a slight tendency toward abstract metaphor ("soft metal of consciousness," "tumors of stress") that borders on purple, but the rhythm and imagery generally support the high-concept tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("scales," "silver threads"), though phrases like "destiny's door" veer into purple territory. A few filter verbs ("watching," "saw") slightly distance the reader during the magic application.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from density of abstract similes ("like hope itself," "like captured suns") and pathetic fallacy ("ice continued its patient surrender"). This "overwriting" creates a melodramatic filter that distances the reader from the concrete reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished and readable, though occasionally overwrought ("seep through his skin like a promise"). Prompt phrases ("firmly adaptive," "trembling certainty") are inserted visibly rather than woven invisibly into the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.3)
    Severe repetition of multi-word epithets ("flaking gold leaf booklet" x3, "storm-tossed ridge fort" x2, "ambered hush" x3, "marbled hush" x2) creates a stuttering, checklist-like rhythm. These artifacts significantly obstruct immersion and signal a lack of lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished and dense, but the opening simile ("gleamed like polished steel") is a cliché that weakens the hook. Some phrasing is slightly repetitive, though the lyrical descriptions of the violin and the "gaps" are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is technically clean and evocative but suffers from a high density of metaphors that can feel overwrought ("sewn itself... like a dark thread," "crystallized like ice"). While the imagery is consistent, the relentless poeticism sometimes distances the reader from the raw emotion of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally high-quality with evocative imagery ("ripening toward rot"). A minor cliché ("practiced ease") appears early, but the line-level craft is otherwise dense and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from the clumsy, verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("icy warmth" x3, "mechanically warm" x2, "subdued awakenings" x2). These repetitions create a checklist effect that disrupts rhythm and breaks immersion, compounding with stock similes like "rippled like water."

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong imagery ("violin case floating... like a patient dog") is undercut by adverbial shortcuts ("miraculously," "perfectly") and filter verbs. The prose sustains the mood but lacks the tightness required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sentence rhythm. A minor artifact appears with the phrase "peripherally aware," which feels mechanically inserted twice to satisfy the prompt, creating a slight repetitive drag. Otherwise, the line-level craft supports the story's ethereal weight well.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, though some metaphors feel slightly worn or heavy-handed ("metal tombstones," "DNA strands"). The integration of the radio dialogue is handled smoothly without disrupting the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and dense, though it occasionally drifts into cliché ("truth bent like light," "silence speaks louder"). The high density of metaphor sometimes slows momentum, and the reliance on list-like cadences ("Books became mulch became moss") creates a stylized but static rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from reliance on cliché lists ("first steps, skinned knees, graduation, heartbreak, triumph") and sentimental overwriting ("underground symphony only mothers could hear"). Pathetic fallacy ("roots... whisper their approval") undermines the grounding established by the eclipse details. The repetition of specific phrases ("dreaming roots," "cautious exuberance") feels mechanical rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric ("spines that remembered being trees"). Rhythm supports the pacing well. Minor deduction for a slightly stock simile ("scattered like broken birds") and the abstraction "tasted of... older secrets," but overall density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory details ("watered whiskey," "contraband instead of cod"). The rhythm matches the "three seconds, darkness, three seconds, light" motif. There are no significant artifacts or loops, though a few phrases ("nothing and everything") lean slightly toward standard rhetoric.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has a strong rhythmic quality and polish, with good attention to cadence. However, it suffers from a density of abstract metaphors ("indigo of pre-dawn doubt," "habit dressed in terror's clothing") that veer into purple prose. These artifacts prioritize sounding profound over clarity, creating a layer of abstraction that dulls the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose has a strong rhythm and high information density, with evocative imagery throughout. However, the text relies heavily on "like" similes to describe abstract concepts ("like pasts," "like memories," "like sand," "like musical notes," "like snow"), which becomes repetitive and creates a slight scaffold artifact. The sentence-level propulsion remains effective despite this tic.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose has rhythm but suffers from clichés ("heavier than physics should allow") and moments of purple abstraction ("fingers made of might-have-beens"). Diagnostic labeling in the climax ("soldier's courage," "hermit's wisdom") flattens the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("frozen heart," "scar tissue," "tender shoots") and oxymoronic overwriting ("filament of hush," "audibly muted") that obscures clarity. The heavy reliance on adjectival stacking slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with good information density and pacing. However, it relies on some familiar phrasings ("practiced grace," "deepening sky") and abstract descriptors that slightly dull the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans heavily into "purple" phrasing ("concentrated absence," "breath of dying stars"). The density of abstract metaphors sometimes distances the reader from the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from a high density of abstract metaphors and "purple" descriptions ("sharp like the moral edges," "savoring impossible choices like wine"). These constructions obscure the physical reality of the scene in favor of thematic posturing. The rhythm is competent, but the reliance on abstract simile reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the phrase "chronic hush" repeats three times, creating a distracting lexical loop. Abstract descriptors in the finale ("magnificent simplicity of survival itself") dilute the concrete imagery established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmic, with high information density in the descriptions of the emotions. Minor reliance on standard adjective pairings ("ancient resin," "professionally thorough") prevents the highest band, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose has a pleasant rhythm but relies on clichés ("eyes blazing with determination," "tears fell like rain") and stock phrasings ("Word spread as word does"). The density is diluted by summary telling, which smooths over the textures that would make the world feel real.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from adjective-heavy description ("endless, forgiving light"). The ending relies on abstract labeling of emotions ("luminescent ache of belonging") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and functional, with flashes of strong imagery ("creatures that existed only in the margins of time"). However, reliance on filter verbs ("She knew," "She saw," "She understood") and passive realizations at pivotal moments distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("stone wept nurturing water onto patient roots"). Sentence-level craft is high, though there is a tendency toward adjectival stacking ("gentle inventiveness," "buried optimism") that tells rather than shows. The density of information is good, keeping the short word count efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, though "ghost in the machine" is a cliché that flattens the specific interiority. The phrase "sapphire hush" reads as slightly purple for a dialogue tag, momentarily distracting from the otherwise clean imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("dissolving into his skin like watercolor on wet paper"). Rhythm and syntax support the pacing well, with no significant scaffold or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm, though it leans toward "purple" phrasing in spots ("cisterns like liquid gold," "liquified time"). The "rain trails" imagery is beautiful and precise, effectively grounding the speculative elements. Line-level momentum is maintained throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from frequent filter verbs ("realized," "could see," "felt") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. There is a tendency toward "purple" abstraction ("dissolved like sugar in rain") and repetitive usage of words like "shadow" and "magic."

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rich, though occasionally dense with figurative language ("salt crystals... like memories"). The transitions between time periods are handled smoothly, though they rely on scaffolding that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is competent, with good rhythm and sensory imagery ("pavement hummed"). However, the prose relies on explanatory scaffolds ("She understood now," "not a question but...") that tell the reader how to interpret the action rather than letting the scene do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstraction ("space between certainty and wonder") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene. Several phrases border on cliché ("flooded through," "hidden language"), reducing the freshness of the imagery and weakening the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    A high frequency of repetitive Subject-Verb paragraph openers ("The solar storm...", "The escondite...", "The intrigue...") creates a plodding rhythm. Additionally, density of abstract modifiers ("electromagnetic fury," "impossible spaces") borders on purple prose, reducing immediate clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and distinct, though occasional abstract phrases like "inherited rage" and "deathly vitality" tell rather than show the underlying tension.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective stacking and occasional purple phrasing, such as "incandescent restraint." While lines like "valley's throat" are evocative, the reliance on filter verbs ("She could feel it now") and abstract descriptors flattens the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density and strong rhythm throughout; the prose avoids major artifacts or loops. The "metal voices harmonizing" in the penultimate paragraph leans slightly into purple prose, but overall line-level craft is precise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("rustled... like dying moths"), maintaining good momentum. However, occasionally abstract phrasings ("simultaneously ancient and immediate") slightly dilute the sensory immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is clean and occasionally lyrical ("reflecting off black water like scattered prayers"), establishing a strong mood. However, pivotal moments often rely on abstract summary or slightly clichéd phrasing ("hopeful desperation," "painful clarity") rather than concrete, immediate action, particularly in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on some decorative abstract noun phrases ("dawnlit melancholy") and stock metaphors ("ghost's breath") in key moments. The technical description of the silver nitrate process is a high point, offering density and specificity that contrasts with the softer descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with good information density and evocative sensory descriptions ("condensation dripped rhythmically"). Mechanics are clean, though dialogue tags occasionally veer into stagey variance ("murmured," "whispered") rather than letting the action carry the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished with strong imagery. However, the verbatim insertion of the prompt phrase "subtly confident precision" creates an adverb-heavy cluster that disrupts the flow, and the "dry wit a shield" phrasing borders on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies on stock "writerly" phrases ("thrummed with life," "weep clear water") and repeats prompt-specific phrases ("wild hush," "infinitely patient") verbatim, creating echoes. The label-heavy description tells rather than shows the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is functional and propulsive but marred by several clichés and stock phrases ("terrified and thrilled," "insects in amber," "defied logic," "science couldn't explain") that dull the imagery. These artifacts prevent the line-level craft from matching the ambition of the setting, resulting in a competent but occasionally generic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("salt air had turned green"). However, the climax relies on summary ("Images flooded through") rather than dramatized scene work, and compound neologisms like "hover-carved" feel slightly clunky.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("swallowed this corner of the world"). Minor deductions for the repetitive use of prompt phrases like "mournful elation" and "winter-cracked fields" as verbatim refrains, which feels slightly looped rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from abstract descriptions mixed with concrete nouns ("dried blood and hope") and repetitive word choices ("impossible hues," "impossible stitches," "impossibly alive"). Telling dominates showing, with heavy reliance on explanatory sentences to justify the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose flows well but leans on stock "literary" phrases ("forgotten promise," "marriage of life and death," "sacred and profane") that dull the impact. While the setting descriptions are sharp, the connective tissue is often abstract or clichéd.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmically controlled ("constellation of symbols," "choreographed nostalgia"), maintaining a high level of craft. However, the middle section leans toward abstraction, "telling" the meaning of the symbols ("fear transformed into art") rather than dramatizing the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong rhythm. However, the phrase "echoed silence" is repeated verbatim within a short space, creating a noticeable loop artifact. Additionally, "hemoglobin code" constitutes a register drift, introducing a scientific clinical term that clashes with the story's established mythic/fantasy lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose relies heavily on a repetitive "noun like noun" simile structure ("roots like frozen screams," "eyes like broken glass," "moonlight... like mercury," "condensation... like morning mist," "like a pearl of truth"). This structural redundancy creates a formulaic rhythm and clutters the imagery, distracting from the scene's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose flows well but suffers from overwriting ("lotus-hearted," "shrewdly innocent," "mist-clad") that distances the reader. The final summary creates a drag on momentum right at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but relies on familiar "ethereal" descriptors (gossamer, luminescence, shimmering). There is a tendency toward "telling" internal states ("faces bright with a happiness so pure") rather than showing them through action. Rhythm is smooth but lacks variation to match intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally smooth and evocative ("beams of reflected sound"), but marred by occasional abstract labeling of emotion ("crystallizing into something tangible," "inexplicable playfulness"). These moments of telling reduce the immediacy of the magical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose has strong rhythm and acoustic texture ("hummed," "cacophonous"), fitting the insect motif. A few abstract phrases ("practiced nonchalance," "deliberate obscurity") act as mild scaffold artifacts, slowing the otherwise high density of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.5)
    Overwriting frequently obscures clarity, particularly through mixed metaphors ("grenades of beauty... shrapnel of longing") and dense abstract pairings. The reliance on poetic affectation stalls momentum and creates distance rather than immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally smooth and evocative, with good rhythm. However, there are register clashes, such as introducing "molecular structure" into a mythic fantasy setting. The phrase "foxglove regret" feels like a forced mixed metaphor that calls attention to itself rather than clarifying the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but relies on adjectival clutter ("cautious exuberance," "catastrophic silence") and stock phrasing ("impossible, but undeniable"). These artifacts distance the reader from the action, replacing immediate sensory experience with narrated conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with dense metaphors ("star-drunk night," "stone lungs," "dappled resolve") and aphoristic statements ("Water, like truth, always finds its level"). These stylistic flourishes sometimes draw attention away from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic. There is a tendency toward summary-style sentence structures ("She began her work by...", "Theodore noticed..."), but the line-level craft is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with high information density and vivid imagery ("fractured hush," "drifting prism"). The phrase "featherly determined" reads as unidiomatic and slightly forced, likely a prompt artifact, but the overall line-level craft remains strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery like the "crimped and blackened" feather. While generally clear, some phrasing leans toward the ornamental ("shadowseam wonder") without adding distinct causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is competent but suffers from sentimental metaphors ("dandelion wishes," "bells wrapped in velvet") and stock synesthesia ("tasted purple"). These artifacts create a layer of "poetic" gauze that softens the imagery and distances the reader from the raw emotional content.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, though it occasionally dips into purple territory ("pinholes in black velvet"). The phrase "foam fingers" is a minor distraction due to its sports connotation, but otherwise, the imagery is functional and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose leans toward the "purple" side with phrases like "chrysalis of solitude" and "shadows pooled like ink waiting to be written." Specific prompt elements like "spontaneously anchored" create register clashes, introducing technical diction into a lyrical passage.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is often striking ("clung to the water like oil," "nodes that rose and fell like breathing"). However, the prose relies on filter verbs ("Marcus understood," "He realized") to convey meaning rather than dramatization. The "physics made visible, mathematics made beautiful" line leans toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on some clichés ("weighed nothing... yet it held everything") and repetitive oxymorons ("harder and softer," "hard softness") to convey depth. These artifacts dampen the emotional immediacy of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is competent, but marred by clichés ("Data didn't lie") and expository heavy-lifting. The text artifact of the equation breaks immersion, reading more like a prompt response than organic fiction. The prose tends to summarize emotional states ("patient determination") instead of showing them through action or sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but relies on stock imagery ("brittle as autumn leaves") and familiar sentimental phrasing ("whispered," "ghosts," "memories"). The rhythm is steady but lacks the sentence-level propulsion or fresh textural density expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and high adjective density ("hesitant colors," "precious hush," "crystalline balustrade"). Phrases like "infinite grace" and "thrumming through her chest" are clichés that dull the impact. The reliance on abstract nouns and decorative modifiers obstructs narrative momentum and distances the reader from the visceral reality of the vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is generally excellent, with standout phrases like "operatively gentle" and "constellation of almost-peace." The opening line ("absorbed centuries of tears") leans slightly into melodrama, but the writing quickly tightens into precise, evocative imagery. Information density is high, and the rhythm supports the solemnity of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and dense with striking imagery ("unborn song crystallized," "archive of absences"). A few phrases lean slightly purple or abstract ("mottled with memories," "nature's own desperation"), but the rhythmic control and sentence variety are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, with figurative language packing nearly every sentence ("starlight like scattered diamonds," "breaking bells"). This density creates a "purple" texture that slows momentum and prioritizes ornamentation over clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is competent but dense with simile strings ("like the skull," "like disturbed dust motes") and abstract summaries of the puppet show's intent. This tendency to explain the metaphor ("stories that justified rather than illuminated") blunts the impact of the imagery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from adjectival clutter (e.g., "weathered fingers," "verdant grotto," "perpetual dew"), creating a dense, slightly overwrought texture. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings reduces immediacy, though the sentence variety and flow remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative. However, the required phrase "technically gentle" appears twice and feels forced, and the "tears freezing" moment leans slightly into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished but leans into purple phrasing ("tears of iron," "trapped stars") and some clichés ("bitter and beautiful"). The syntax flows well, but the density is occasionally diluted by the need to explain the high-concept mechanics explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetition artifacts ("empirically ironic" x2, "dusky harmony" x2, "covenant" x4) mar the prose and trigger the template-cadence penalty. The phrase "knowledge uncloak itself" is syntactically awkward, and the "empirically ironic" usage feels like a prompt constraint pasted in without integration.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is competent but leans heavily on purple, abstract descriptions ("reality bent like water," "metal's cellular memory") that distance the reader from concrete action. There is a tendency to "tell" significance through metaphors rather than "show" it through specific details, resulting in a dense, fable-like texture that lacks immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.5)
    While there are moments of beauty, the prose relies too heavily on stock imagery ("fog... like a living thing," "insects in amber," "spider-web patterns"). These clichés flatten the unique imagery of the glass and orchard, reducing the textural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but relies on stock imagery ("dying stars," "determined fingers") and heavy-handed similes ("deciduous vows—like autumn leaves"). While readable and clear, the line-level craft lacks the freshness found in the setting concept, leaning on familiar phrasings.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from filtering ("turned to find herself," "saw her own hand") that distances the POV. Abstract metaphors ("tasted like... prophecy," "flavor of temporal paradox") reduce the visceral impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and achieves good information density, but relies on genre-standard phrasing ("groaned open," "ancient heart," "hummed with... frequencies") that blunts the novelty. The description of the "unheard symphony" borders on abstract telling rather than concrete sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("viewed through disturbed water"). The mandatory phrases are integrated smoothly, though the final thematic summary slows the momentum slightly at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and readable with good momentum, particularly during the rope-braiding sequence. Minor repetition of descriptors (warmly methodical, pulsed warm) and some filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") distance the reader slightly from the immediate sensation of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.2)
    The phrase "gentle luminescence" is repeated three times in a short text, creating a distracting artifact. The prose also leans on stock pairings ("practiced precision," "patient certainty") and filter verbs that dilute the vividness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought, relying on "purple" descriptors ("impossible geometries," "devoured light") and familiar similes ("wildflowers through concrete"). While the rhythm is smooth, the reliance on decorative phrasing softens the impact of the stronger, more concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is polished but dense with abstract nouns and filter verbs that dull immediacy. The reliance on "thought verbs" to convey the character's internal state prevents the reader from experiencing the realization through concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong sensory imagery ("breathing green light") and a distinct rhythmic quality driven by the chant. The prose maintains momentum, though a few phrases veer into slight melodrama ("absolute black," "defiance against the weight").

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from occasional overwrought metaphors ("rearranging the topography of their conversation") and heavy-handed similes ("like the jade cicada—solid, ancient, and translucent"). These artifacts obscure the emotional immediacy of the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally evocative and polished, with strong imagery like "frost made of whispers." A few phrases tilt toward the overwrought ("molecular bonds prepared to reverse their ancient dance"), and the required phrase "intangibly tangible" creates a minor stylistic bump, though the surrounding sentence absorbs it reasonably well.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with good sensory density, though the repetition of "crystalline" in the opening paragraphs and the slightly awkward prompt insertion ("fluidly logical precision") create minor textural hiccups. Rhythm is well-managed to match the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is weakened by clumsy telling, particularly the forced insertion of "wisely adventurous steps" as a modifier for movement. Phrasing often relies on stock constructs ("liquid curtain," "song of democracy") that reduce information density and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but leans on familiar metaphors ("surgical precision," "noose") and abstract phrasing ("careful devastation"). The density of adjectives and explanatory clauses slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by significant telling artifacts, most notably the dialogue tag "voice carrying a virtuously mischievous undertone," which smuggles abstract emotional labeling into the scene. Some descriptions veer into cliché ("bitter and bright"), though the "snow made of light" image lands well.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("shattered in a cascade of golden fragments"). However, the verbatim repetition of several multi-word tags ("sepia reading room," "golden shadows," "first yawn of evening") creates a scaffolded feel that detracts from the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with high density, though some descriptions veer into abstraction ("living equations, solving themselves"). The integration of required phrases varies; "factually mystical energy" reads as a clumsy modifier that disrupts the line-level flow.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and flows well, but suffers from occasional overwriting and cliché (e.g., "wounds required archaeology to heal"). These moments of "essayist" narration flatten the emotional impact of the otherwise strong specific imagery like the button and the marginalia.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is readable but heavily modified with adjectives and standard metaphors ("unraveling like poorly woven cloth" is tautological). Some purple description ("transforming the surface into a mirror of possibilities") slows momentum. The writing tells rather than shows, particularly regarding Mira's resourcefulness.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, though it occasionally suffers from overwriting ("shadow-song," "unheard harmonies"). The insertion of prompt phrases like "quietly vivid tableau" creates minor rhythmic stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is frequently overwritten with abstract adjective-noun clusters ("fractals of emerald joy," "ancient satisfaction") that blur imagery. The phrasing often tells emotions rather than evoking them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("rust loved and precision hated"). Sentence variety is good, and the text is free of distracting artifacts or loops, supporting the fable tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically competent but leans heavily on abstract, "purple" descriptions ("distilled intention," "captured starlight"). While the imagery is often pretty, it occasionally obscures concrete reality with metaphorical density that distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has strong moments ("weeping made of music"), but suffers from occasional weak modifiers ("modestly fearless") and slightly purple diction ("achingly luminous"). The rhythm is generally good, though the dialogue tags and beats feel somewhat standard.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("drowning in reverse"), maintaining high information density. However, some phrasing leans into abstraction ("decimals of her pain"), and the "cracking open... not breaking" line is a familiar cliché that softens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically sound, with strong imagery like "pentimento shadows" and "cobalt blue." However, phrase-level straining appears in required elements like "elusively tangible" (an awkward oxymoron) and "anchors of intuition," which feel slightly forced into the sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with high density and evocative imagery. The score is limited by the "explain-everything" summary paragraph at the climax, which tells rather than shows the critical backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("sun painted frost patterns"). While some phrases lean towards the purple ("origami made of time"), the rhythm is strong and the line-level mechanics support the dreamlike atmosphere without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is functional but marred by a density of clichés and stock imagery ("frozen tears," "edges singing," "unshed tears," "familiar fire," "beautiful and terrible"). These artifacts dull the emotional sharpness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is functional but marred by stock metaphors ("tongue dripped honey," "heart pumped tar") and simile overload ("like sugar in rain," "like morning rain"). Frequent filter verbs ("Elias felt," "Elias recognized") distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmically sound, with strong imagery like "stalactites that hung like frozen rain" and "realities folded... like pressed flowers." The density of metaphor supports the tone well, though the repeated character label slightly mars the otherwise clean execution.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but suffers from repetitive phrasing (the specific compound "turbine-hum" appears three times in a short space). Several lines feel like inserted prompt artifacts ("scaffold complexity with simplicity"), breaking the organic flow of the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with some strong imagery ("catching the last light like a held breath"). However, the text relies too heavily on filter verbs and summary statements ("She understood," "seemed to shift," "understanding now") to mark progress. The repetition of "understood" as a beat marker weakens the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract telling ("something had torn inside her mind") and balanced-phrase clichés ("hurt and healed in equal measure"). These artifacts dilute the density and immediacy of the prose, particularly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished and readable, with clear syntax and decent rhythm. However, it relies on several clichés ("dark as dead eyes," "pulsing in unison like a heartbeat") and abstract summaries of the magical process ("hummed with remembered purpose") that blunt the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery ("mathematics carved in wax"). There are minor dips into cliché ("joints protesting") or abstraction ("spectrums of emotion became inexpressible"), but the overall density and flow are strong. The line-level craft supports the story's somber weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished but marred by the repetitive, forced insertion of the prompt phrase "furiously tranquil." Some redundancy exists ("sublime directly into vapor"), though information density is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose relies heavily on telling and abstract descriptors ("unnatural calm," "primal authority," "unprecedented magnitude") rather than concrete sensory details. Phrasing like "credibly curious" is awkward and adverb-heavy, and the final sentence drifts into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is polished but leans on abstractions and slightly purple phrasing ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance"). There is a tendency to "tell" the emotional import of images rather than letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery like "broken teeth" and "captured sunset." There is a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing ("luminous weight"), and the required phrase "contextual clues" feels a touch academic against the poetic backdrop, but the overall rhythm is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished with strong opening imagery, but the climax relies on summary telling ("feeling them click together like puzzle pieces," "mysteries were finally revealing themselves") instead of concrete action. These shortcuts dilute the impact of the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is competent but suffers from overwriting and cliché (e.g., "breaking heartstring," "symphonies in seaweed"). The reliance on adjective-noun pairings creates a monotonous rhythm that dampens the immediacy of the kite-flying scene.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is high-density and rhythmic, with standout phrasing like "diagnosis had arrived like salt spray" and "remodel not buildings but boundaries." Syntactic control supports the pacing, particularly in the transition from mechanical work to metaphysical realization. No significant artifacts or drag.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but marred by abstract phrasing (skepticism "casting doubt") and repetitive tagging ("bronze quiet" appears three times). The reliance on telling ("Elena had built her career on...") slows momentum and distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("pods rattled like old bones"), supporting the accumulative drive. However, occasional purple phrasing ("purple twilight bled") and the repetition of the specific phrase "narrow vastness" within a short span distract slightly from the otherwise high polish.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally evocative ("wild hush," "amber wax"), though the ending slides into abstract summary ("sorrow transformed into hope"). The line-level craft supports the tone well, with only minor reliance on slightly worn phrasings for emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.0)
    The four-word phrase "gilded compass rose applique" is repeated verbatim four times in a short space, creating a jarring, unedited rhythm. Additionally, the phrase "echoed silence" appears three times, signaling a reliance on stock descriptors rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong, with evocative imagery ("frozen needle," "living ice") and good information density. The prose flows well, avoiding major artifacts or repetitive sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally high-quality with strong rhythm and imagery ("ghosts of legislation"). However, a few metaphors feel slightly overworked (rats holding votes) or self-consciously literary, which occasionally distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished with evocative imagery ("mercury... rippled without wind"), but suffers from explanatory scaffolding. Phrases like "Not literal ones, but the memory of seeds" and "not her past, but permission to plant" interrupt the narrative flow to decode the metaphor for the reader, reducing the density and impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Polished, evocative prose with strong rhythm and imagery ("veins across the pewter sky"). A few phrases in the resolution tilt toward abstraction ("fog made of whispers"), but line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose relies on familiar similes ("broke apart like ice in spring," "truth... like light through water") and abstract metaphors that dilute the scene's physicality. There is a tendency toward melodrama ("whispered to the bone") that reduces the grit and immediacy of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose has momentum but suffers from abstract telling ("transmuting despair into something eternal") and filter verbs ("Mira could see," "Mira understood") that dilute immediacy. The sentence-level craft is competent, but the reliance on summarizing emotional states rather than showing them limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mechanically polished but suffers from abstract emotional labeling and clichéd similes ("spider-webbing," "dark mouths") that flatten the imagery. The phrasing "colors of today's confused grief" tells rather than shows the complexity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose has moments of beauty ("bruise healing into gold") but suffers from overwriting ("vibrations of intent," "gentle violence"). These dense, abstract phrases sometimes clutter the emotional clarity rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic ("scraped against concrete"), though occasional phrasings like "vast indifference that had swallowed whole cities" and "terrible longing" feel slightly generic compared to the sharper, more specific imagery of the salt and sulfur fields.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and atmospheric with strong imagery ("hung like broken arms"). Mechanics are clean, though the summary in the second paragraph slows momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with standout imagery ("stretched into fog like a severed finger") that serves the tone. There is a slight tendency toward over-explanation in the climax ("The final gesture hadn't been suicide but baptism"), but the line-level craft is generally excellent. The repetition of the prompt phrase "softly persistent" is noticeable but functionally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rhythmic and precise, with strong sensory details like "oilcloth and string" and "edges worn smooth." Aside from a few abstract phrasings ("kingdoms swallowed by time"), the line-level craft effectively maintains momentum and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally polished and dense, but leans occasionally into overwrought phrasing ("voice like silk drawn across broken glass," "pulsing like a bruised heart"). Adjective stacking in places ("softly commanding," "practiced indifference") slows the rhythmic momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose has rhythm but relies on abstract modifiers ("ineffable weight," "wild hope") that obscure concrete detail. Several prompt phrases (e.g., "directed spontaneity") are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the natural flow of the sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally evocative and polished, though the simile "sound like bark peeling" feels slightly strained and "smelling possibility" is a minor abstraction artifact. The rhythm effectively mimics the spiraling nature of the protagonist's reality without losing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but overwritten in places, relying on abstract metaphors ("mineral deposits mapped emotional terrain") that distance the reader from the physical reality. The repetition of "trembling calm" and diagnostic phrases ("humanize grief") acts as scaffolding that should have been removed.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mechanically smooth but relies heavily on "like [noun]" similes ("like velvet," "like frost," "like stars," "like porcelain"), which creates a repetitive texture. The final beats lean on summary rather than dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no significant artifacts. The final image ("written in a dead woman's perfume") is a strong, resonant closer that anchors the story's metaphors in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm and high density. There is a tendency toward abstract phrasing ("moment before moments," "space between spaces") that risks slight opacity, but it generally suits the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("soft echo in the reservoir"), supporting the story's flow. A few similes lean toward the conventional ("mercury in a basin," "bird bones"), preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is competent but marred by clichés ("quiet wildfire") and "telling" artifacts ("familiar strangers"). The metaphor density in the latter half obscures the immediate reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("rivulets trace equations," "grocery lists bleeding into differential equations"). There is a slight tendency toward overwriting in moments of reflection, but the line-level craft is generally strong and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and readable, though slightly purple in descriptors; the insertion of the required phrase "melodically haunted" feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and has good momentum, but it suffers from occasional overwriting and cliché ("purple waterfalls," "sheets of gold," "halo"). The technical descriptions of the archival work are the strongest line-level elements.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but marred by clichés ("grin sharp enough to cut glass") and reliance on abstract adjectives ("desperately jocular"). The flashforward summary at the end acts as a prose artifact that distances the reader from the pivotal moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rhythmic and competent but relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings and slightly purple abstractions ("impossible music," "quiet blaze"). The flow is smooth, but the density of modifiers occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is competent and clear, though occasionally leans into sci-fi clichés ("constellations of data," "raw manuscript of spacetime"). The rhythm is good, but the reliance on slightly purple descriptors prevents the line-level work from reaching the highest tier of freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but frequently relies on filter verbs ("realized", "felt") and abstract adjectival labels. The "spilled mercury" simile is a worn cliché that reduces the freshness of the opening imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose flow is generally competent, but the triple repetition of the specific phrase "volcanic tenderness" constitutes a significant text artifact that mars the polish. The phrase "analytically intuitive" also reads as a slightly clunky modifier stack that tells rather than depicts.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies and repetitive descriptors ("auric lagoon," "auric waters," "aurora," "auroral"). Phrases like "beautiful and terrible and absolutely irreversible" read as clichés. The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with strong density and evocative imagery. Sentences move with momentum, though occasional phrases like "painted green fire" lean toward standard description rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies on awkward adverbial phrasing ("spiralingly calm") and clichés ("lodged in his throat like a stone"). The heavy use of filter verbs ("Thomas began to understand," "Thomas found himself") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is competent and evocative but leans into purple phrasing ("breathing with an ancient pulse") that can feel ornamental. There are noticeable lexical loops, such as the phrase "forests of second thoughts" and "amplified quiet" repeating without deepening the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is fluid but marred by filter verbs ("Mira recognized," "Mira understood") and abstract labeling of emotions ("combative tenderness") instead of embodied showing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("carved through morning mist," "dark clock hands"), though the simile "roses turned brittle as old laws" leans slightly into explaining the theme rather than letting it resonate. Overall rhythm is excellent, mirroring the whittling.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetition artifacts mar the prose in the final third: "lantern-moth hush," "tremor of certainty," and "aesthetically driven" each appear multiple times in close proximity. These loops suggest a limited lexical buffer and detract from the otherwise competent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but marred by oxymoronic tells ("innocently cunning undertone") and received phrases ("money had lost meaning"). The final paragraph summarizes the emotional takeaway rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but relies on oxymorons ("powerfully gentle") and clichés ("perfectly imperfect," "dust motes dancing") that reduce precision. The repetition of "golden shadows" in such a short space suggests a lack of distinct descriptive variety. Sentence rhythm is functional but lacks the propulsion of a high-stakes scene.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is competent and atmospheric but relies on several clichés ("rock bottom," "shoulders hunched against more than cold," "whatever came after"). The mandatory phrases are inserted somewhat conspicuously, disrupting the natural rhythm. However, images like the "constellation of flames" are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished with some strong imagery ("sleeping snake," "flowing river"), but suffers from repetitive rain motifs ("rain drummed," "rain-slick," "rain from his coat," "rain intensified," "rain continued"). Phrases like "algorithmic intervals" tell rather than show the complexity of the magic system. The line-level craft is competent but leans into purple descriptions that occasionally slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with excellent rhythm; the syntactic disruption during the transformation ("dancing—no, convulsing") is purposeful and effective. No scaffold or loop artifacts detected.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant prose artifacts lower the score: the specific phrase "softly deliberate" repeats (echo), and "colors that had no names, only feelings" is a classic ineffability cliché. The reliance on abstract modifiers ("luminous," "perpetual," "prismatic") creates a density of adjectives that slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is functional and clear but relies on some clichés ("dissolved like mist") and slightly heavy-handed abstractions ("surrounded by mist and consequence"). The metaphor of the glass roof as judgment feels a bit manufactured, preventing a higher score for line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("water seeping through stone"). However, the sentence structure often falls into a repetitive subject-verb cadence ("She lay," "She sat," "Maya stood"), and the pervasive filtering dulls the immediacy of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm and flow are competent, but the prose suffers from abstract-concrete pairings ("dust motes and memory") and oxymoronic overwriting ("hushed thunder"). These artifacts slightly dull the immediacy of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("liquid emerald," "velvet darkness," "trembling hands"). The density of adjectives and "purple" phrasing ("shadowed rapture," "divine madness") slows momentum and distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose rhythm is strong and sentences are dense with imagery. A minor artifact penalty applies for the repetitive use of "quantum" and "probability" as modifiers (quantum flowers, quantum foam, quantum entanglement, probability fog, probability pirate) which dulls the precision.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is competent but decorative, often prioritizing poetic cadence over muscular action ("ripening toward miracles"). There are moments of "tell" disguised as "show" (e.g., "understood with sudden clarity"), and metaphors occasionally feel strained ("mate with logic").

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose suffers from "simile fatigue" and abstract vehicles ("clung like unspoken prayers," "braiding... like trust and release"). The density of figurative language obscures the physical reality of the scene, creating a purple-prose effect in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and dense with sensory detail ("numb from frostbite," "phantom sensations"). The "nerve regeneration" motif is handled with precise, non-repetitive language that tracks the story's progression. Minor artifacts include the mixed metaphor of "frostbitten hope" and the slight overuse of the "cobalt" descriptor, but line-level propulsion remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory details ("ink that spread like living shadow") and high information density. The pacing moves effectively from the montage of centuries to the immediacy of the final scene without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    While sensory imagery is often vivid ("glass sang high"), the climax suffers from filter verbs and expository scaffolding ("Lena finally understood," "The revelation had been delayed"). These artifacts flatten the immediacy of the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival bloat and "purple" tendencies (e.g., "exhaustion dressed as peace"). The literal insertion of the prompt phrase "awkwardly confident" disrupts the flow, and the "thunderous serenity" oxymoron feels forced rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally competent with clear action and imagery ("soften like honey"). However, there is a tendency toward overwrought metaphors ("brushing against hers like silk scarves," "vegetal dreams") that occasionally slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense ("drones that moved like wasps"), with strong sensory signaling. A momentary lapse into abstract summary ("anchored optimism in realism") slightly flattens the mid-story momentum, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally vivid but occasionally overwrought ("mirror that had seen too many futures"). Some moments of "telling" interrupt the immersion ("Not metaphorically—actually, physically closer"), and the epiphany is partly explained rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished and dense, but relies on a few clichés ("stretched like taffy") and heavy "telling" of significance. The rhythm is good, but the reliance on expository summary to convey the epiphany dulls the impact of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from several overwrought phrases and the awkward insertion of prompt requirements ("bravely conflicted," "blink that follows surprise"). The repetition of crystal/crystallized textures ("ice crystals," "breath crystallized," "crystalline warnings") borders on repetitive. Momentum is otherwise maintained well.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is polished but suffers from abstraction ("inculcating values into their very roots") and heavy use of filter verbs ("she saw," "she watched"). Figurative language often obscures physical reality ("prayer made solid"), resulting in "telling" disguised as "showing."

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is polished, the specific word "transliterate" appears three times in a short text, creating a noticeable lexical loop. Some descriptors lean toward the ornate (“vowels of void”), and the repetition of the zigzag motif slightly dulls the propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished, but marred by a few clichés ("pulse with possibility") and filter phrases ("That was when she understood"). The insertion of the attribute "devotedly observant nature" is syntactically clunky and reads as a forced prompt check rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is fluid but dense with adjectival stacking and mixed metaphors. The specific phrase "meteor hush" is repeated in both the dialogue and the final paragraph, reading as a forced insertion of a prompt term rather than an organic recurring motif.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has moments of strong imagery ("milk through water"), but often relies on clichés ("beautiful chaos") and abstract modifiers ("unsettling beauty," "profound"). The "telling" of the emotional shift—rather than showing the sensory details of that shift—dulls the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery. However, the phrasing "warm coldness" and "cold warmth" feels repetitive and oxymoronic without adding depth. The ending leans into slightly purple abstraction ("cradling empathy in arms of steel") that feels less grounded than the earlier descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but leans toward "purple" territory with stacked sensory metaphors ("symphony of purple light and cinnamon warmth") that occasionally clutter the imagery. The rhythm is good, but the reliance on adjective-heavy description slows momentum in the back half.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally polished, but the phrase "somatic markers" repeats three times as a jargon crutch. The prompt phrase "fractally precise" appears twice as a static modifier, creating a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, though some "tell" heavy sentences drag on momentum. The use of "residue," "constellations," and "topology" builds a cohesive lexical set, but expository density in the first half slows the reading speed.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished and lyrical but leans heavily on abstract nouns ("essence," "possibility") and "telling" summary; the final section devolves into expository scaffolding that explains the plot's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prompt phrases like "prudently daring" and "vouchsafed" feel mechanically inserted and disrupt the flow. Repetitive phrasing ("silver hush," "unused courage") and some "tell-y" internal summaries dampen the prose's density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose rhythm and imagery are polished, though emotional beats rely on abstract labeling ("betrayal," "disappointment") rather than concrete embodiment or action.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density in descriptive passages. A reliance on filter verbs ("she understood," "she saw," "she felt") during the epiphany distances the reader from the immediate experience of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from a lexical error with "instill" (used incorrectly to mean embed/wedge a physical object) and some overwrought imagery ("spilled... like mercury," "quivering hush"). The high volume of reflective backstory slows the sentence-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the prose is generally polished, the word "brittle" appears five times in a short space (awakened brittle, brittle awakening, brittle of weakness, etc.), creating a distraction. "Atomically reflective" is also repeated verbatim, indicating a need for tighter lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is fluid and rhythmic, but the density of figurative language ("prayer made manifest," "wisdom wearing dancing shoes") borders on overwriting. Some phrases lean into cliché ("space between heartbeats"), which dulls the impact of otherwise sharp imagery like the solder and jasmine.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("heated debates," "trembling fingers," "smiled grimly") and "told" emotions. There is a tendency toward melodrama ("metallic sentinels," "weapons of cognitive disruption") that undermines the gritty realism the opening attempts to establish.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies heavily on clichés ("clawing at his chest," "eternal dance," "yawned before him," "trembling fingers"). While readability is high, these stock phrases dull the impact of the unique conceptual elements. The "then he heard it" transition is a functional but standard scaffolding artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("sibilance of charcoal"), though figurative language is dense and occasionally leans into "writerly" phrasing ("silk weave speak of expensive parties").

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is marred by distinct lexical loops. The specific phrase "spongey dread" appears twice (paras 6 and 13), and the descriptor "nervously confident" is repeated for two different characters (paras 2 and 11). These artifacts create a sense of limited vocabulary and distract significantly from the otherwise competent sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally competent but leans on abstract metaphors ("pixelated amnesty made tangible," "ashes of 'never'") that tell rather than show. Some phrasing, like "dissolved like morning frost," borders on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("rusted into the hillside like a wound healing over"). However, it occasionally leans into "literary" clichés ("perpetual twilight," "eternal game") that soften the impact of the stronger, more concrete details.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished but relies on some clichés ("whale song," "scientific skepticism crumbling") and abstract summaries. The "healing words" metaphor muddies the causal logic at the line level. There is a tendency to "tell" emotional states ("weight of shared exhaustion") rather than evoking them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information density is generally good, but the prose suffers from occasional purple patches ("liquid truth") and abstract phrasing. The "tell" heavy middle section reduces the immediacy of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from artifact repetition, specifically the phrase "anxious elation" appearing twice to define the mood. Metaphors are sometimes dense to the point of abstraction ("braille," "sutured," "cradle of light"), slowing the momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with high density, but slips into overwriting ("settling into her bones like sediment"). The threefold repetition of the prompt phrase "fiercely gentle" creates a lexical artifact that feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("threads worn soft," "ghost vibrations"), though it occasionally slips into purple phrasing ("swallowed his shame") or filter verbs ("Marcus understood," "he felt"). The rhythm supports the melancholic tone, but the explicit internal summary at the end creates a drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable but relies on abstract phrases ("pure understanding," "strange, beautiful geometries," "reorganized her very atoms") that lack distinct texture. Filter verbs ("She felt," "Sarah understood") appear at key moments, distancing the reader from the immediate action. The writing is functional but lacks the density or propulsion of higher-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong image density ("pulling memories... like silk threads") and no distracting mechanical artifacts. A few phrasings veer into abstraction ("pulsing with displaced meaning"), but the line-level craft generally supports the serene, mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from purple abstractions like "sparkle like veins of hope" and "constellation of reflected possibilities." The phrasing "during the heartbeat of a hesitation" is syntactically clunky and interrupts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative, though it leans heavily on similes ("like a man trying to disappear," "like a confession," "like a heartbeat," "like scales"). While individual images are strong, the density of figurative language occasionally calls attention to itself. The pacing and sentence variety are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is rhythmically smooth but suffers from abstract modifier stacks and occasional clichés ("whispers that echoed from nowhere and everywhere"). While some images land well ("folding through time like origami"), the reliance on "telling" summaries weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("absorbed sound like a confession booth"), with strong rhythm and distinct imagery. Information density is high, avoiding loops or scaffolding, fitting the demands of the short form well.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but relies on abstract intensifiers ("perfect threshold," "infinite depth") and synesthesia clichés ("sound like light given voice"). These reduce the visceral impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies heavily on stock similes ("like silk," "like water," "like bark," "like smoke") and abstract descriptors ("softer than memory"). Clichés like "racing heart" and "settling dust" reduce the freshness of the line-level work, though the rhythm is generally competent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density. However, a stylistic tic of oxymoronic or abstract modification ("sincerely insincere," "designer uncertainty," "protected vulnerability") repeats enough to become noticeable, and the dialogue sometimes prioritizes aphorism over naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally lyrical and dense ("floating like leaves"), but marred by clunky exposition ("At seventy-three years young—or rather...") that disrupts the rhythm. The repetition of the specific prompt phrase "sycamore hush" in both a dialogue tag and narration feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("stretched like a wound," "sheet music written across the sky"). However, telling artifacts ("Yula's historically reverent nature demanded...") and the summarizing final didacticism flatten the poetic impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished but leans on "purple" abstractions ("last light of things that once mattered," "cape woven from dawn itself") that reduce concrete immediacy. While the rhythm is good, the reliance on metaphorical density sometimes obscures the physical reality of the scene. The description of "sculpting theorems" is a creative but slightly strained image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.7)
    Integration of prompt phrases is clunky ("signify not meaning," "meteor hush," "wandered purposefully"), resulting in stilted syntax. The prose suffers from abstraction ("signified doorways") and repetition of key terms. There is a lack of sentence-level propulsion, as the narrative halts frequently to explain the metaphysics of the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with high density, though marred by prompt-mandated phrasing ("quietly enthusiastic") that weakens the line-level impact. Some metaphors ("insects in resin") are strong and precise, while others verge on over-written description ("gnawed... like background radiation").

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with a strong rhythmic quality and high information density. A few abstract similes ("soft as grief") weaken concrete descriptions, but the line-level craft effectively supports the atmospheric tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, though it relies on somewhat standard imagery ("like a prayer," "flickering like a candle"). The technical descriptions of the acoustics are handled well, balancing clarity with atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("memory pooled like standing water"), though "mirrored" is repeated as a primary descriptor. The rhythm supports the contemplative pacing required by the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with some striking images like "water became light." However, the density of abstract metaphors ("winter's entire library," "cursive mathematics") borders on purple, occasionally distancing the reader from the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is functional but marred by the repetition of specific phrases ("soundless echo," "muscle memory") within a short word count. The phrase "attentively inventive" is a clunky "tell" that disrupts the rhythm and offers summary instead of dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean and competent with good density. A few phrasings lean toward cliché ("understanding flooding through me"), but the descriptions of the neural tissue and the dojo are sharp and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by frequent filter verbs ("She understood," "She recognized," "reminded her") that distance the reader. Several phrases lean into purple abstraction ("hush of a possibility just born") which clogs the rhythm, and the reliance on summary in the middle section drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose features strong rhythmic moments and inventive imagery (the mechanical choir), but slips into cliché with phrases like "happiness into dust" and "slipped through the hourglass." The word "macerated" is a bold choice, but the text relies too heavily on adjectives and "supernatural" descriptors to do the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong sensory imagery ("drinking light," "crunched like broken glass"). The sentence rhythm supports the pacing well, though the rhetorical question regarding tears leans slightly toward melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is readable and rhythmic, with strong imagery in the alchemical descriptions. However, reliance on clichés ("struck him like lightning") and slightly purple phrasing ("frozen bloom") detracts from the otherwise solid craft.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery and good rhythm. A few moments of "telling" (e.g., explaining the Guild's training rather than showing it in action) and the clichéd final thematic summary hold it back from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level craft is competent with some evocative phrasing ("dawn approached sideways"), though it leans toward purple prose in places. The pacing is smooth, but the reliance on abstract concepts over concrete action dampens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished with some evocative imagery ("sinew thread sang"). However, certain phrases ("realistically imaginary") feel awkward and repetitive, and the reliance on binary descriptors (organic/synthetic, real/not) becomes a noticeable tic.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is readable but marred by clunky adverbial clusters ("balancedly curious") and abstract telling ("impossible patterns") that dilute specificity. Key transitions, such as the students' shift from skepticism to wonder, occur in summary rather than dramatized scene work. The reliance on label-speak ("somber marvel") reduces the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the imagery is vivid, the prose suffers from strained metaphors; the opening simile ("breath through broken teeth") is visually confusing for mist in a glass atrium. Phrasing like "virus of forgetting" and "reeling hush" leans on cliché rather than fresh, concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong imagery like "constellations in the flooded dark." A few phrases lean on standard descriptors ("crushed... like a physical weight," "clutched his journal"), which slightly dampens the otherwise high density of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("code cascading like snowfall"). The sentence rhythm supports the pacing, particularly with the interjected heartbeat counts. No significant loop or scaffold artifacts disrupt the flow, though some phrasing leans slightly towards the ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lush and atmospherically dense, supporting the "textural" drive of the story. A few phrases lean toward the overwrought ("crack running through its heart like a frozen scream"), but the rhythmic control and sensory specificity generally maintain a high standard.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("physics bent like growing vines"), but occasionally leans on clichés ("defying physics"). The momentum is good, though the final paragraph's summary of the theme drags the ending into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong with high density and good rhythm. There are moments of slight overwriting or adjectival clutter ("resonantly soft," "calculated patterns," "metronomic time") and some filter-like phrasing ("She had discovered," "Lira had learned") that distance the reader slightly from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose relies on stock "workshop" imagery ("mechanical ballet," "uncertain shadows," "ghost of thunder") and overwrought phrases like "cobalt cathedral of broken promises." While mechanically competent, the density of clichés and adjectival padding reduces momentum and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from the repetitive use of prompt phrases ("misting hush" appears three times, "whispering gleam" twice) which dulls their impact. The climax relies on cliché similes ("like water," "like stars") and abstract summaries of emotion rather than concrete, embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is mechanically sound but relies on "writerly" stock phrases and abstract sensory pairings ("smelled of... possibility," "apologizing to an old friend"). Paragraph openers tend toward a repetitive scaffold ("Marcus...", "The...", "He..."), reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with clear momentum. However, the reliance on slightly familiar imagery ("eyes the color of deep water") and the explanatory nature of the ending hold it back from the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("pinprick of light," "defying physics") and overwrought, mixed metaphors ("supernova compressed into a whisper," "symphony of potential futures"). These artifacts obscure clarity and reduce the impact of the imagery, prioritizing flowery sentiment over precise description.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally evocative ("squelched," "amber shadows") but relies on some standard phrasing ("familiar thrill of discovery," "shattered glass ceiling") and filter verbs ("she could see," "Margaret understood"). The description of the constellations is the highlight, but line-level texture could be sharper in the internal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and functional but relies on several clichés ("eyes that had aged years," "understanding dawning") and some overwritten phrasing ("watching how the frozen shadow writhed"). The dialogue has a staged quality, serving exposition more than naturalistic interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjective-heavy "purple" description and tell-y shortcuts. The phrase "insatiably creative" appears twice as a clumsy label rather than a demonstrated trait, disrupting the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery, though it occasionally drifts into purple territory ("shadows that seemed to breathe"). Information density is good, but some emotional beats rely on abstract descriptors ("lucid unrest") rather than concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished but slips into "purple" abstraction at the climax ("transformed pigment into prophecy"). The use of balanced toggles ("Protection without isolation, revelation without exposure") feels rhetorical rather than organic. A few stock phrasings ("adjusted her spectacles") detract from otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense, but reliance on adverbs like "impossibly," "miraculously," and "somehow" to explain the premise weakens the line-level authority. Occasional filter verbs ("she realized") distance the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is evocative but cluttered with filter verbs ("recognized," "understood") and awkward hyphenated constructions like "sang-spoke-encoded." The reliance on the specific phrase "dream electric dreams" feels like an unexamined cliché that detracts from the story's unique imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished and readable, with some strong imagery ("gears clicked like a grandfather clock"). However, it occasionally relies on abstract similes ("light like suspended grief") and aphoristic phrasing that pushes the tone toward sentimentality rather than literary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished and high-density, but the repetition of prompt-specific phrases ("quietly explosive," "dusty starlight," "spooled wholeness") becomes noticeable and mechanical within the short length. The imagery is otherwise evocative and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but relies on several clichés ("crystalline clarity," "wind held its breath") that dull the imagery. While the rhythm is generally good, some descriptions feel slightly overwritten ("condemned cathedral of knowledge") rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from filter verbs and clichés ("understanding flooding through her") and telling rather than showing ("diligently curious nature"). The writing is competent but plays it safe, lacking the density or freshness required for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lyrical and dense with strong imagery ("words tasted of salt"), maintaining good rhythm. However, a reliance on modifiers (adverb-adjective pairings) and filtered perception prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent and clear, with some strong phrasing ("brambled hope"), though it occasionally drifts into purple territory ("despair made visible"). The density is adequate, but the reliance on summary prevents rhythmic acceleration during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("nested patterns" x4, "pane of hush" x3, "beautifully flawed" x3) within a short word count. This "keyword stuffing" creates a mechanical rhythm that distracts from the otherwise evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("copper wings," "amber light"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the pacing of the rescue. The phrasing "graceless beauty" is deployed well to characterize the aesthetic of survival.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense with relevant metaphor ("hurt polymerized into distance"). A few phrases land as slightly stock ("pieces fell into place," "sat down hard"), but the rhythm generally supports the reflective pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high-value imagery ("quantifying absence," "parole-glow") that supports the magical logic. Sentence rhythm varies effectively to control the pacing of the incision scene.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is marred by mixed metaphors (sandpapering vs. digesting; crystallized time vs. frozen scream) and clichéd phrasing ("time moved differently," "empires rising and falling"). Register drift is significant, oscillating between lyrical description and diagnostic labeling ("emotional contagion"). The reliance on filter verbs ("She glimpsed," "She felt") distances the reader from the sensory immediacy of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose has a smooth rhythm but suffers from cliché ("ancient heartbeat," "sentinel") and evident prompt-artifact insertions. The "vigorous, tender" pairing appears as a direct adjective drop rather than an organic description of sound.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition of key phrases ("abandoned dreams" x4, "helix-minded" x3, "chaotically precise" x2) within a short word count creates a stalled, looping effect. The prose relies on convenient labels ("Fibonacci sequence") over fresh description, and the repeated text artifacts dull the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("breath becomes stone"), but suffers from specific artifacts. The "Orin understood" loop repeats a realization stem three times, and the spatial contradiction in the gravity description ("hung... from... floor") obscures the image. These issues drag on the otherwise solid line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm and clear imagery, but relies heavily on "telling" and diagnostic labeling ("Mira was symphonically minded," "Mira's empathy in motion guided her"). These summary statements distance the reader from the immediate experience of the sculpting process.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is competent but leans toward purple descriptors ("bleed from the sky") and repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("thoughtfully precise" appears twice). The word "correlate" is forced into contexts where it feels unnatural ("correlating with the magnetic field's rhythm"), creating a mechanical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the imagery is generally strong, the prose suffers from significant repetitive word choice, specifically the word "theatrical" appearing three times in key descriptors ("theatrical stillness," "theatrical timing," "theatrical sincerity"). Additionally, the verb "adjust" is overused for the primary action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    While mechanically sound, the prose suffers from register clashes ("olfactorily sensitive nature" vs. "wildflower hush") and forced phrasing ("journalize"). The reliance on summary flattens the rhythm, lacking the propulsion of active scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative with strong imagery ("frozen waterfalls in reverse"), establishing a distinct texture. However, the climax relies on abstract descriptions like "knowledge flooded through her" rather than concrete, grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear but suffers from repetitive vocabulary (using "impossible/impossibilities" three times) and sentence structures. The "montage" of installing monitors glosses over physical logistics too smoothly, reducing the textural density of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but leans toward purple ("magenta harmonies that smelled of ozone and childhood"). While the imagery is creative, the density of adjectives and filter verbs ("Lyrian understood," "She felt") occasionally slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery, though the adverb construction "avalanchingly quiet" borders on purple. The score is capped due to the register drift of "fail forward," which introduces a business-manual artifact into an otherwise lyrical passage.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("mechanical heartbeat," "solutions to the equation"), but occasionally lapses into "purple" mathematical metaphors that obscure rather than clarify ("grief multiplied by infinity," "square root of abandonment"). These abstract constructions reduce the visceral impact of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with adjectival stacking ("aurora's electromagnetic song"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("She watched," "She held") that distances the reader, and the "knowledge flood" sequence relies on abstract summary rather than concrete, dramatized detail.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is competent but suffers from repetitive lexical loops (variations of "crystallized/crystallizing," "accumulated," "firmly grounded," and "shifted hush" all repeat). Phrases like "shattered like winter ice" and "truthful lies" read as clichés that flatten the specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally evocative, but the middle section relies on scaffolded explanation ("Not metaphorically—literally threading words") that disrupts momentum. There is also a noticeable repetition of the word "raveling/unraveling" in close proximity, creating a minor textural loop.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but dense with abstract nouns ("patterns of bartered awakenings," "fog of traded consciousness") that obscure the physical reality. Some sentences rely on explanatory scaffolding ("His meekness wasn't weakness but...") rather than showing the trait in motion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no significant scaffolding. The synesthetic imagery is evocative without sliding into confusion, maintaining a strong forward momentum throughout the shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from sentimental adjectival phrasing ("peculiar ache," "anguished"). The "telling" of emotions prevents visceral impact, and the pacing drags during the expository dialogue in the lantern room.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose flows well but is marred by stock metaphors ("pierce the veil," "blade through silk") and abstract phrasing that reduces information density. Filter verbs ("Mira felt it then," "Mira could see them all") distance the reader from the immediate action, and the physics terminology feels slightly grafted onto the fantasy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and descriptive, with high information density in the imagery. However, there is a reliance on adjectival stacking ("iridescent caution," "unfamiliar rhythms") that occasionally slows momentum. The recurrence of "Kael [verb]" sentence structures creates a repetitive cadence that a more varied syntactic approach would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but occasionally dips into cliché ("time seemed to pause," "storm holding its breath") and purple phrasing ("whispering calculations older than numbers"). The rhythm is generally good, but these artifacts blunt the sharpness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally dense but suffers from specific weak points, such as the tautological opener ("caught no light, for there was none to catch") and the clumsy phrasing "wasn't quite not-dawn either." The image of "subsonic thrumming" making iron "ring like a struck bell" creates a sensory contradiction (inaudible vs. audible).

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is competent and moves the story forward, but relies on some stock phrasing ("anguish washed over him," "gift and curse"). The pacing is steady, though the density of imagery could be higher in the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, relying on "purple" phrasing ("ghost-echo," "future rain") and abstract-concrete pairings ("rosemary and time"). The density of modifiers slows momentum without adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("footstep rang like a prayer bell"). However, the simile "blood from stone" carries an idiomatic weight (impossibility) that slightly muddies the intended image of leakage, and the decimal ratings feel tonally distinct from the surrounding lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high-quality imagery ("recognition blooming like algae," "broken bottles"). The rhythm supports the tension, particularly in the descent and the confrontation. Minor artifact: the prompt phrase "curiously steadfast" sits a bit awkwardly as an adverbial cluster, but overall line-level craft is publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sensory density is high, but the "tasting/flavor of [abstract concept]" construction becomes repetitive (used for revelation, convergence, questions, destiny). Phrasing like "terrestrially cosmic" is repeated as a label.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("chest cracked open," "time moved differently") and abstract telling ("rectify the imbalance"). High density of filter words and "to be" verbs in key moments flattens the immediacy of the artistic act.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("pale green crystal"), but occasionally slips into "telling" internal summaries ("She understood now"). The phrase "smelled of copper and regret" is a mixed-metaphor artifact that strains for poignancy rather than earning it through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but leans toward "purple" abstraction ("gossamer of curiosity," "crystallized awe"). Phrases like "stone finger pointing at eternity" border on cliché, though the rhythm and flow are generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("wings of flame that folded inward"). However, the phrase "complete incompleteness, a perfect imperfection" is a rhetorical tautology that reads as overwrought and slightly clutters the resolution. The rhythm effectively slows during the ritual, enhancing the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies on stock metaphors and clichés ("tears fell like rain after drought," "words bloomed fresh") that dull the emotional impact. The phrase "sandstorm calm" is repeated as a label rather than integrated into the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong with evocative imagery ("smelling of memories," "carved patterns through the water"). There is a slight tendency toward "purple" descriptors ("danced across Maya's shoulders," "mathematical poetry") that softens the impact, but the rhythm and clarity remain high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished, but the phrase "gleaming silence" appears three times (twice in adjacent closing paragraphs), creating a distracting lexical loop. Additionally, "crystalline clarity" is a cliché that weakens the pivotal moment of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    While imagery is often vivid ("invisible fruit"), the prose suffers from the register slips noted above and occasional heavy-handedness ("trillion smaller possibilities"). These anachronisms break the spell of the otherwise lyrical style.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and maintains a steady rhythm, with strong textural details like "warm wax" and "chipped porcelain." A few phrases lean towards cliché ("steam rising... like incense") or awkward construction ("patiently nimble"), but the line-level craft is generally competent and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and strained metaphors ("inverse stars," "twilight's embrace," "memories learning to dance") that obscure clarity. While grammatically sound, the reliance on abstract noun phrases ("resonance structures," "ghostly resolve") reduces the visceral impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is strong, with good rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A few phrases lean into cliché ("liminal moment," "precision of weapons") or abstraction, but the prose generally moves with momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally functional with some strong imagery, but is marred by "telling" artifacts (e.g., "The revelation came through progressive disclosure"). The text relies on summary to explain patterns rather than dramatizing them in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but leans into clichés ("voice like wind through ice caves") and purple abstraction. The mechanics of the reveal are glossed over with vague phrasing, and filter verbs ("Marina saw," "Marina recognized") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is marred by adjectival clutter (&quot;scintillatingly somber,&quot; &quot;demure audacity&quot;) that feels forced and oxymoronic. There is a significant repetition artifact with the word &quot;whisper&quot; appearing five times in a short space. Filter verbs like &quot;recognized,&quot; &quot;understood,&quot; and &quot;saw&quot; frequently distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by frequent telling and stock phrasing (&quot;clicked lazily,&quot; &quot;sharply observant nature,&quot; &quot;crack in reality itself,&quot; &quot;comfortable lies&quot;). These artifacts, particularly the opening adverb and the summary of attributes, reduce immediacy and prevent the writing from feeling fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with strong rhythm. However, the text relies heavily on metaphor ("history's lungs," "taste copper and rebellion"), occasionally prioritizing lyrical flourish over clarity, which creates a slight drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but overwritten with adjective-heavy descriptions ("achingly beautiful," "salt-stiffened"). The reliance on stock phrasing to convey emotion flattens the impact of potentially strong images like the sound jars.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with adjective stacking ("fleeting golden sunset") and vague similes ("wings of forgotten birds"). The phrase "electronic hunger" feels slightly abstract compared to the concrete grounding elsewhere. The line-level craft supports the tone but draws attention to itself in places.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("rose like organ pipes"). There is a slight tendency toward simile stacks ("Like water... like ice...") and standard phrasing ("tide turning," "falling at first") that softens the impact. Rhythm is generally well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but leans on clichés ("unfinished business," "heart too full") and abstract summaries; repetition of "memories" and "saw" creates a slight drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but prone to adjectival stacking ("aptly deliberate precision") and sentimental abstraction ("sure as grace"). The repetition of "vibrant hush" and the heavy use of weather metaphors reduce line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong visual descriptions of the kaleidoscope's effects. However, it leans heavily on abstract pairings ("death into data, hunting into harmony") and rhetorical parallelism that occasionally distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by tech inaccuracies (RGB values cannot naturally be 4827) and purple phrasing ("sang in mathematical harmony") that distracts from the grounded opening.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong and evocative with good rhythm ("patience of trees"). There is a tendency toward adjectival stacking ("shadow-woven," "weathered," "impossible"), but the line-level craft remains clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic ("rosary of sharper prayers"), but the presence of several stock images ("insects in amber," "breath forming ghosts," "sigh more than a scream") in descriptive peaks lowers the score. These clichés flatten moments that otherwise aim for high poetic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose leans into purple overwriting ("honey crystallizing," "taillights dissolving," "tears reflecting flames"). The metaphor of the voice carrying "passionate subtlety of aged wine finally uncorked" is strained and mixed. These artifacts clutter the line-level experience and distance the reader from the emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is mechanically competent but marred by prompt-forcing and repetition of key terms. The phrase "whisperfield calm" is used as a clunky modifier ("whisperfield calm deliberation"), and the prompt phrase "after the prophet arrives" creates a jarring tense error in a past-tense narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but overwrought with dense metaphors ("crystalline clarity," "living prayers") that slow momentum. The writing tells emotions ("earnest whimsy") rather than evoking them through specific action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from a severe density of similes (seven "like" constructions in a short space), creating a template cadence that dulls the imagery. Phrases like "like sleeping animals," "like mushrooms," and "like seeds" cluster too closely, functioning as a scaffold rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("chalk grew smaller... wearing away like years"). However, the reliance on filter-like summaries for emotions ("strange sorrow," "surprise, then recognition") and the swift summary of the climax ("Then they found it") undercut the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and distinct, but relies on scaffolding phrases ("She understood now") and explicit telling of realizations ("She'd found her purpose"). The phrase "luminous ache" is used as a label for emotion rather than allowing the feeling to emerge from the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and readable but marred by poetic clichés and oxymorons such as "pulsing stillness." Adjectival phrasing like "decisively kind hands" feels overwrought and reduces the density of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and high information density. Phrases like "coordinates, not of stars, but of absence" and "shadows that fell upward" demonstrate excellent line-level craft without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery ("clouds that never quite touched the earth"), but suffers from "telling" the emotional conclusions (e.g., explicitly explaining that forgiveness became innovation). Abstract summaries of Thomas's understanding blunt the impact of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mechanically clean, but marred by adjectival clutter and telling ("instantly and magnificently"). The prose leans on standard descriptions ("smooth as silk") and the simile "memories resurfaced like breaching whales" is a cliché that detracts from the specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose is polished, it relies on familiar "literary" pairings ("emerald and jade," "trembling fingers") and motif hammering (repeating "honeyed hush," "amber pendant," and "pattern the ice left"). These repetitions feel like forced cohesive devices rather than organic threads.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is frequently overwritten, relying on abstract metaphors and oxymorons ("violent patience," "archived silences," "sculptures of rust and rebellion") that obscure rather than clarify. High density of filter verbs ("she understood," "she watched," "she felt") creates distance during pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies heavily on "purple" descriptors ("perfume of remembrance and renewal," "cathedral of green shadow") that abstract sensory experience into labels. While grammatically clean, the reliance on standard creative-writing metaphors ("bruised sky") and abstract nouns dampens the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose suffers from metaphor stacking ("mercury made of dawn," "patience of tides," "furnace of its birth") which creates drag during high-momentum beats. The description of "colors that had no names" is a genre cliché that weakens the visual specificity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("frozen lightning," "instruction manual written backward"). The rhythm supports the contemplative tone, though there is a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in the reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high, with strong sensory verbs ("exhaled," "calcified") and consistent rhythm. "Boundary-lessly" is jarringly ungrammatical, though accepted here as a prompt constraint; otherwise, the prose supports the meditative tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    "The tiger turned wrong" demonstrates high-level compression and impact. However, lines like "tears that wouldn't fall" lean toward cliché, and the prose occasionally drifts into abstract definitions of love rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory density ("rust eating through iron," "disposable camera wheel"). The rhythm supports the pacing of the discovery. No significant scaffold or loop artifacts; the writing remains tight and propulsive despite the contemplative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but suffers from "purple" abstractions ("mathematics of human aspiration") that obscure concrete action. Phrase-level artifacts like "system groaned, protested" rely on clichés rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with good density. There is a slight tendency toward over-explanation (e.g., defining "petrichor" in the text) and adjectival density ("excruciatingly gentle," "meticulous script") that occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is competent but leans on standard literary descriptors ("mirror-black," "weathered hands"). The mandatory phrase "serene upheaval" is used twice as a noun phrase, creating a repetitive and slightly clunky rhythmic artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by specific clichés ("smooth as silk," "morning frost") that flatten the imagery. The flow is steady, though it leans on expository summaries of the "secret weavers" history rather than active dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is evocative but repetitive with key terms ("absence," "presence") and relies too often on filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "realized"). The phrase "lonesome splendor" appears twice, feeling forced as a refrain in such a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés ("dream within a dream," "days blurred into nights," "tick-tick-tick"). These artifacts flatten the emotional texture and indicate a reliance on stock phrasing over fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is competent but suffers from cliché ("weight of memory," "smoke like water") and sentimental metaphors ("soft as forgiveness"). The reliance on abstract adjectives and explicit emotional labels reduces the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is marred by severe phrase looping and "prompt-itis," with specific terms ("defiant hush," "sidereal patience," "luminous skeptic") repeated verbatim multiple times as labels. Metaphor density is suffocating, often stacking similes ("like a compass needle," "like silk on a thorn") that obscure rather than clarify the action.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "adjective-noun" density ("translucent form," "cosmic blooms," "stellar flowers," "ethereal body"), creating a slightly purple texture. Metaphors like "starlight like dew on spider silk" feel decorative rather than urgent. There are no major technical errors, but the rhythm is sedate, lacking the propulsion required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery. However, the specific phrase "thundering calm" appears twice (once in memory, once in Martha's speech), creating a repetitive artifact that draws attention to itself. Some descriptors like "fiercely meditative" feel slightly adjectival and told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally competent but stumbles into abstraction at peak moments ("shimmered with meaning," "vibrated through the air"). The physical impossibility of the carved rake handle (microscopic text on rough splinters) is a significant logic flaw at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("shears catching starlight," "pearl to charcoal"). Some phrasing leans toward the ornamental ("hollow throat," "endless song"), and the direct repetition of distinctive phrases reduces the freshness of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is competent but leans into abstraction ("visual symphonies of probability") and summary rather than concrete scene work. Phrases like "darkness cannot darken what already gleams black" feel overwrought and slightly tautological.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasional purple phrases ("narrative spores") and the tendency to explain effects ("dreams would return") reduce line-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but occasionally leans on clichés ("practiced precision," "silence," "flooded in") and explicit telling ("Time to complete the ritual"). The reliance on abstract summary to land the ending ("promise as ephemeral and essential as breath") weakens the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm ("receded like a tide"). There are minor lapses into "telling" at crucial moments, particularly the simile about the journal's weight ("as if it contained the mass..."), which explains the emotion rather than trusting the image to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from weak phrasing at critical moments, such as "implied to be moving" and the tell-heavy "somehow, impossibly." There is a tendency toward overwrought description ("absorbed sound like autumn leaves absorb rain") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Competent flow is undermined by reliance on cliché abstractions ("sweet nostalgia mixed with bitter loss") and tired similes ("memories are like weeds"). These "scaffold" phrases reduce the sensory immediacy of an otherwise tactile concept.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with good density. A minor confusion arises with "Her pocket buzzed" immediately followed by pulling out a matchbox (implying the box buzzed or an unmentioned phone did), and the simile "like broken promises" leans toward melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("blazed through her consciousness") and a reliance on filter verbs ("she saw," "she realized") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, but the climactic dialogue ("mixed from red necessity and blue grief") is overwrought and abstract. The "tentacles" metaphor for the mind is a cliché that weakens the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffold artifacts. The sentences propel the narrative with a specific, hard-edged lyricism ("ruthless logic of perpetual motion") that mirrors the story's environment. The transition between the physical act of rolling dice and the metaphysical implications is handled with syntactic grace.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("unshed tears," "mind's eye," "deep within her") and adjective-heavy descriptions ("saffron-tinted," "moon-tipped"). The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation or propulsion needed to convey the urgency of insomnia or the trance state.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent and descriptive but relies on some "scaffold" phrasing ("Working frantically," "familiar dread"). The use of "palimpsest" feels slightly cliché in this context, but the overall rhythm supports the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and maintains good momentum, with strong imagery ("time itself cracking"). There is a reliance on some adjectival clustering ("practiced precision," "neatly inventive") that slightly dulls the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("flooding through her like formaldehyde"), though occasionally veers into overwrought territory ("silk being pulled through broken glass"). The pacing is solid, with sentence rhythm mirroring the tension, and technical execution is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong density and rhythm. However, a few phrasings feel slightly clunky ("fractal generating inward"), and "sussurus" is misspelled (susurrus). The description occasionally leans toward purple ("restless euphony"), but the imagery remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("deep, geological groan"), maintaining good momentum. Some figurative language leans toward the generic ("like a prayer unanswered," "swallow her whole"), but the line-level craft generally supports the story's tone without distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally functional but marred by occasional melodrama and mixed metaphors, such as the letter "glowing with purpose." The ambiguity of whether the letter literally burns or metaphorically glows muddles the physical action of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from occasional overwriting ("ink as black as the space between memories"). The "stoically sensitive" phrasing acts as a text artifact that tells rather than shows, creating distance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, with strong rhythm. However, the integration of prompt-specific phrases like "tranquilly perceptive purpose" results in a clunky adjective-stack artifact that briefly disrupts the otherwise smooth flow. The phrase "act of dappled resolve" also feels slightly forced semantically.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but marred by melodramatic phrasing ("swallowed little Lin whole," "terrible morning") and adjective-heavy descriptions. There is a tendency to tell emotions ("agonizing to create") rather than showing them through physical action or sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and maintains momentum, with good sentence variety. There is a tendency toward purple phrasing ("bleak exhilaration," "intangibly tangible") that detracts slightly from the grit of the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally competent with some strong images ("stone tiles... like movable type"). However, there is a tendency toward filter verbs ("Kira felt," "Kira understood") and adjective-heavy descriptions ("brilliant dimness," "surprising quietness") that tell rather than show the emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic. "Sieved hush" is a strong, recurring phrase, though "bruised purples" in the opening is a slight cliché. The density of information is high, moving the story forward efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is generally polished, the text suffers from visible artifact loops. Unique phrases like "furrowed hush," "uncommonly thoughtful," and "untethered" are repeated verbatim in the final paragraphs, creating a "checklist" effect that detracts significantly from the literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by the verbatim repetition of the clunky prompt phrase "merrily melancholic" within a short space. Several metaphors ("gut feeling," "eroding his confidence") border on cliché, and the final paragraph relies on abstract summary rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clean and grammatically sound but lacks distinct texture, relying on standard descriptors. The phrasing is competent but often abstract ("inexplicable acts of understanding") rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, suiting the high-fantasy tone well. Phrases like "petals becoming scales" and "doorways between states of being" create high information density. The pacing accelerates appropriately during the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose flows well but is occasionally undercut by sentimental clichés ("pinch of pride, three cups of hope") and overwrought descriptors ("liquid starlight"). These "purple" artifacts clash with the story's otherwise sophisticated and melancholic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs (5+ instances of "felt/sensed") and slightly purple descriptors ("crystalline traces," "opalescent sheen"). These artifacts distance the reader from the physical action of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric but leans toward purple density ("patient waltz," "universe had whispered") that borders on decorative. Filter verbs ("She felt it then") occasionally dull the immediacy of the physical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished with good information density, but marred by the logic break in the lighting description and the use of worn idioms ("death by a thousand paper cuts"). The flow is solid, but the imagery in the opening clashes with the established environmental constraints of the blackout.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("borrowed dawn," "ribbons descending"). Some descriptors lean slightly generic ("something more complex," "luminous with understanding"), but the density of information and image is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("lightning carved silver veins"). There is a slight tendency toward purple phrasing ("applause from the universe," "electric kiss"), but the rhythm and line-level control are generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.3)
    Relies on "purple" clichés ("brook that whispered," "caught morning light like a prism") and telling rather than showing ("dignified chaos," "diplomatically fierce"). The simultaneous dialogue tag ("they said simultaneously") is a mechanical flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level mechanics are competent, but the prose suffers from overwriting and immediate explanation of metaphors ("molted... like a snake," "transformations weren't madness but method"). There is a reliance on abstract nouns and adjectives over concrete verbs, and the density is diluted by the high volume of backstory summary.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high density and strong imagery ("stars emerged like perforations"). There is a slight tendency toward overwriting in moments of high emotion, but the line-level craft is generally strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with high density and some striking imagery ("laughter recorded on seismographs"). It occasionally drifts into "purple" adjective-heavy description, and the final sentence serves as a rhetorical scaffold that slows the momentum of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("silence stretch like morning mist"). However, it occasionally veers into sentimental overwriting, particularly the description of the color cerulean "pooling in the hollow of a throat," which sacrifices clarity for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in rhythm; high information density with selective, concrete nouns. One template run—“she noticed… she noticed… she noticed…”—dulls momentum mid-section; minor scaffold, not touching closure. Metaphors stay coherent and tied to physics imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught: frost ≈ glass lattice. No mixed metaphors or loops. “Drifting resonance” is repeated intentionally, paid off in final line. Information density high; each sentence advances recognition or stakes. Only micro-slip: “luminous material that would eventually poison him” is slightly expositional, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes—long aerial sentences for aurora, staccato for 62 Hz beat. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “prismatic symphonies” is single, sustained vehicle. Information density high: one sentence often delivers temperature shift, emotional valence, and world logic (“leaves brightening by two degrees Celsius in a spiraling pattern”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Two typos (“unshaken” for “unshattered,” “wavelengths” plural) are the only micro-slips.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: “rainbow ghosts across his workspace” does triple sensory/image/foreshadow job. One metaphor cluster near lens-repair beat risks purple (“crystallized into something he could inhabit”) but pattern is taught and later echoed. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for descent, staccato for transformation climax. No synonym loops, no filter-verb stacks; high information-to-word ratio maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentences deliver time-jump, supply detail, emotional shift. No loops or scaffold; “midnight bell” repeats with accruing weight, not churn. Metaphors are consistent—“forgotten prayer,” “heartbeat”—and physically coherent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks. Copy clean; no tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with the scene—long sentences for twilight hush, staccato for spark eruptions. Information density high: one sentence can paint bloom-time, reveal camera function, and foreshadow sacrifice. No loops, no mixed metaphors; “ribbons of light like silk scarves underwater” keeps physics coherent. A single scaffold-ish phrase (“the healing began not with taking…”) is justified by its parallelism with prior repetitions of giving.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but each image does double duty: “photographs bleeding their colors into the air” simultaneously shows loss and environmental contamination.

Final third is artifact-free, allowing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates: long sentences for surveillance lull, staccato for escape. Metaphors stay physical (“chains singing,” “roots breaking through concrete”).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—image, backstory, metaphor (“apple trees swayed…like drowning hands”). Rhythm modulates from lyrical cadence to staccato forge beats. No template cadence, no mixed metaphors; “cellular faith” is the only near-abstraction but saved by biological grounding. One paraphrase loop (“cells divide and renew while she worked”) keeps this from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Figurative language kept selective; no metaphor muddle. Varied sentence openings; paragraph cuts purposeful. One minor paraphrase loop (“golden hour… golden light”) forgiven for motif function. No scaffolding, synonym churn, or template cadence. Final silver splash image is crisp, propulsive. Copy-edit clean. Artifact-free in closure beat; 9-band eligible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“blue at its heart, like hope itself”) without crowding high-pressure beats. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges torch-light motif. Strong verbs—“swept,” “gather,” “breathes”—replace modifiers. No register drift; technical terms (radiation, exclusion zone) are accurate and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm modulates from long clause-setting to staccato confrontations; no template cadence detected. Information density high—“equations... identity reconstruction protocols” compresses world-rule without pause. Mixed metaphors kept in check; “promise” for cold metal is the one poetic reach, but it lands. No scaffolding, no synonym loops; closing line breathes with quiet finality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph lengths mimic waves. Metaphors are mixed once (“ambered hush like resin” vs. “marbled hush”) but coherent within oracle consciousness. No loops or scaffold; density high—each line layers sky, booklet, body. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud ear is clean: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density high—“ice crystal so pure it seemed to bend light” does world, character sensor bias, and object magic in one stroke. One paraphrase loop: “seventeen distinct timeline loops” restated adjacent (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; the violin’s sublimation is physically tracked. Momentum never stalls despite lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: calm garden stroll yields longer sentences; gift moment snaps to monosyllables. Figurative language is spare—one “lightning-crack” simile, one “bloom-rot” oxymoron—each charged with closure weight. No synonym loops; “marble,” “crack,” “lie” recur only when meaning accrues. Every sentence advances knowledge or image; zero filter-verb clusters in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong information density: one sentence often fuses job detail, sensory cue, and world rule. Metaphor load is high but patterned—liquid light, origami time—paid off in closure image. Scaffold loops appear: “mechanically warm,” “icy warmth,” “subdued awakenings” recycled within adjacent sentences, costing immediacy. No grammar slips, but simultaneous “frost forming on glowing heat” is physics hand-waved rather than motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for aurora descent, clipped fragments during calibration. No loops or scaffold; information dense—“her body’s knowledge” does triple duty. Metaphors coherent (aurora as grief made visible). Minor register lift (“magnetosphere”) justified by station context. Final line weighted exactly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with descent—long sentences for tunnel crawl, staccato for caller bursts. Information density is high; each radio fragment layers history without repeat. Metaphors are kept physically grounded (“metal tombstones,” “circulatory system”). Minor loop: “swallowed truth” appears twice with no new inflection; otherwise no scaffold or paraphrase. Copy-clean except one comma splice after “1982” that does not fog causality. Final line lands with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high but patterned; metaphors (roots through marble, phosphorescent moss) cohere within eco-catacomb logic. Minor loop: “change without judgment” phrase recurs three times without new inflection. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Sentence variety good; paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm. Closure line avoids purple excess, landing cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies—long breathy sentences for ascent, clipped fragments at insight. High density: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interiority). No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“broken birds” for diaries) but does not obscure causality. Clean grammar; paragraph cuts pass.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from long melodic coils to fragmentary beats, mirroring lighthouse pulses. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors—and tied to music/espionage lexicon. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Microdot, beam, and fortune slips reappear with evolving states, satisfying presence test.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Metaphors are dense but internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. A single paraphrase loop—“stillness except motion holding its breath”—is pardonable because it is immediately re-cast. Final sentence achieves Charged Poise without clutter, sustaining high-band clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds image or pressure. Figurative density is high but patterned—spiral, mirror, dawn, frost—so coherence holds. Internal rhyme (“hurts to perceive direct”) and syntactic inversion serve pressure, not ornament. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers external motion and internal tenor (“path behind to dissolve and reform ahead”). Metaphors stay internally coherent—bridge as labyrinth, tablet as black-hole mass. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding detected. Opening line anchors voice, closing line richens it. Micro-issues: occasional adjectival flourish (“sickly green,” “quantum foam”) but these track Kira’s lexicon; no clarity break.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative anaphora (“each note arriving before its own birth”) gives way to clipped fragments at wind-down. Sentences perform double duty—e.g., “She felt it then—the thawing” advances story (event) and atmosphere (temperature metaphor). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines act as phonograph-couplets, circling like the stuck needle, creating purposeful circularity without algorithmic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The aluminum tube…bore official markings—pre-quarantine government seals that should have been impossible” advances plot, world-rules, and stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; prop tracking (tube, journal, anemometer) stays coherent. A single scaffold stem—“she had documented…she had assumed…she had pressed”—is purposeful anaphora, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts are tight, no scaffold loops. Metaphors are coherent—light/memory/perfume share translucence—no mixed vehicles. Information density is high; every sentence at least doubles (action + atmosphere, or setting + metaphor). Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” phrase is justified by prior technical diction; does not breach POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: long hypnotic rolls crash into staccato revelations—“He set the rope down gently.” No filter-verb stacks; sensory verbs are active—“clay sang,” “rope trembled.” Mixed metaphors are scarce; one near-slip—“cosmic scales that could never be balanced”—survives because the moral logic supports it. Information density is high: one sentence often layers physical detail, ethical implication, and temporal vertigo.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm succeeds: glass/ash/brine/music cadence rises and falls like a score. Information density high—one sentence can set scene, reveal history, and prime acoustic effect (“rust catching the morning light through cracked panes overhead”). Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles); “broken teeth” fits shipwrecks’ menace. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each descriptor adds new angle rather than restating.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: one sentence often layers sensory data, tool function, and emotional cue (“sparks danced…petal began to darken”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the electromagnetic vein. Rhythm accelerates with the dusk countdown, then exhales in the final sentence. Minor overwriting in “liquid gold” and “pools of liquid gold” so close together, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no scaffold loops, but a mild “how” anaphora and two near-repetitions of “tucked/tucking” barely register. Figurative language is restrained—one mixed metaphor (“tears fell like rain on calm water”) is forgivable. Information density solid: one sentence often does two jobs (anchors + atmosphere). Opening line efficiently marries symphony + harbor + locked office. Final line breathes, no clutter. Copy-clean.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work: “each translucent fruit catching fire” does triple duty. A few near-metaphor clusters around “web” appear but never obscure causality. No scaffold loops; opener and closer are crisp. Minor register inflation (“conceptual repricing” risk) is avoided by keeping abstraction tied to reed image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm varies: long liquid sentences for canal travel, staccato for chamber list of extinctions. High information density—each sentence advances image or causality; no scaffold or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (time as clay, snore-ripples) and pay off. Zero typos, tense stable, pronoun clean. No overwriting in peak beat; clarity intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet lucid—“eternal twilight beneath dripping stalactites” does triple scene-setting work. No loops; each sentence advances image or equation. Figurative control holds through climax: “spreading ripples of bioluminescent fungi” keeps physical logic consistent. Minor register lift in “conceptual mathematics” fits POV.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers body, tool, and atmosphere. Figurative language is spare, precise—“vacuum tubes…click of mechanical relays” is concrete, not decorative. Information density high; final line re-cues “sapphire hush” without recycled phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the storm: longer horticultural sentences contract into clipped sensory fragments as the merge begins. No loops or scaffold; each image does dual work (leaf as object and omen). Figurative language stays within physical logic—“watercolor on wet paper” precisely captures dissolution. Closure line is clean, propulsive, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates tide-long sentences with single-stroke fragments, propelling without drumbeat. Figurative control: “liquid gold” is the only quasi-cliché but earns its keep by linking economy and worship. No synonym churn; “rain trails” reappear only to mark vanishing time, so repetition is purposeful. One scaffold near 600-word mark—“She would use it to paint…each stroke a threshold”—compresses future arc efficiently and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High information density—each image does double archival and emotional work. Mixed metaphors absent; “ocean spray” recurs but accretes meaning. One paraphrase loop: “collision and retreat” / “sing its particular song” adjacent—minor. Otherwise clean, propulsive, read-aloud ready. Proofing perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud ear; sentences vary in length and opening. Occasional soft scaffold—“she realized,” “she understood”—slightly dulls peak immediacy but artifacts never obscure causality or closure. Figurative strata are sparse enough to avoid overwriting penalties. High information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long, storm-bright sentences and curt fragments (“Together?”). No filter-verb stacks; “She turned the cursed amulet fragment between her fingers” keeps action immediate. Metaphor vehicles stay internally coherent—light drinking, gravity obeying “suggestions”—and do not collide. One minor scaffold: “weight of hushed thunder—power restrained, waiting” could lose “—power restrained, waiting” without loss, but it occurs pre-closure and does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density: single sentences advance plot, symbolism, and procedure simultaneously. Occasional lyric inflation—“cancer was just his body’s way of keeping honest books”—tips toward aphorism but stays character-true. No scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. Pronoun and prop tracking clean; “pot” never drifts to “vase” or “jar.”

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “water trickled over stones shaped like sleeping birds” does triple sensory work without clutter. One paraphrase loop—“the trees always knew” echoing “the trees knew better”—is minor enough to keep 9+ eligibility. No mixed metaphors or register drift; technical language (fluorescent refraction, electromagnetic patterns) stays accurate and motivated. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with temperature drop and dawn surge.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes with tide. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“metal cliffs,” “grammar of erasure”—never clutters high-pressure beats. Information density high; each paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. Clean grammar and precise punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, strong verbs (“perched,” “froze,” “rusted”). Information density high—each sentence layers setting, character, or concept. Occasional lushness (“papers rustled…like dying moths”) risks purple but stays tied to emotional temperature. Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines bookend with cadenced certainty. No artifact touches the closure beat; qualifies for the high band but lacks the last measure of compression that would lift to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “green paint spiraling up the lighthouse replica” does triple duty—action, color, world rule. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. A single mixed metaphor—“her dual allegiance pulled tight as rope”/“culture shock absorber”—is forgivable at 750 words and doesn’t recur. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; closing line recharges motif. Copy-clean: pronouns track, tense stable, no typos. High-band gate met; only the slight cadence dip noted above keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet lyric: every sentence advances image or stakes; no filler verbs or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and tested—“ghost’s breath” is the one simile, justified by vacuum crystallization. A single paraphrase loop (“humanity was retreating… humanity remembered why it had reached”) is forgivable at closure cadence; otherwise density is high and rhythm varied.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Varied sentence rhythm mirrors droplet cadence; no template runs. Figurative language is sparse and tied to mist physics—“acoustic signatures,” “whispering locations.” Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new tactile data. Minor scaffold: “The patch adhered perfectly” could compress, but does not obscure causality or dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; every paragraph advances stakes or image. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“cataract eye” lake, “herald’s gesture” from the falcon—no mixed-metaphor clutter. One paraphrase loop detected (“worried tranquility” echoed twice) but it occurs early and does not touch closure. Final line cadence mirrors opening frost pattern, earning high-band ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical yet lean; sentences vary, no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“that wild hush that falls when a crowd discovers magic”) fits the fairy-tale register. One mixed metaphor—“weep clear water”—barely grazes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variation is surgical; no template cadence detected. Each clause advances image or stakes—“temple’s architecture defied logic” immediately followed by embodied consequence: corridors that force identical re-entry. Metaphors stay physical and consistent (jellyfish threads, amber insects). Only microscopic redundancy: “lonesome splendor” appears twice—acceptable as deliberate tonal echo.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences layer job—world, body, metaphor—without pad: “copper light from the setting sun paint the confession booth’s lattice” carries time, color, and symbolic map in one sweep. Mixed-metaphor risk in “hover-carved itself into the wood” is brief and justified by supernatural premise. Rhythm breathes: longer image bursts tighten into single-line testimony punch. Minor scaffold: “lived” appears twice in two sentences mid-story; doesn’t obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and musical: “tears of amber resin,” “white silk between the pomegranate trees.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative density is high yet coherent—metaphors (fruit as hearts, debt as weight) echo across beats and culminate in mortal apples without mixed logic. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, satisfying the read-aloud ear test. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“he felt” x2) in memory flood, but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so 9+ remains theoretically reachable; this keeps it just shy.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “barnacles grew on petroglyphs” packs world-rule, time-depth, and sensate detail in six words. No paraphrase loops; each image advances spiral or tide logic. One mixed-metaphor risk: “orchids—rare, delicate, and impossibly alive” beside “dried blood and hope”—but the clash is purposeful, charging the final oxymoron. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs (“pierced the air,” “colonize”) propel motion.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences do three jobs—“ olives ripened on branches that had learned to grow through tombs” advances time, setting, theme. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is organic to orchard logic. Minor overwriting risk in “forgotten promise” opener, but it pays off thematically. Final line shadow sweep is crisp, propulsive, unadorned—lets image carry catharsis. Pronouns, tense, geography stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long sensory sentences build texture, then a single clause—“Tomorrow, rain would wash it away”—delivers the gut-punch. Information density is high; each sentence layers metaphor and world fact without padding. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “the intimacy of handwritten addresses” follows “people had rediscovered the weight of paper” in contiguous summary; it advances world lore so only −0.1. The final line crystallizes earlier motifs without overwriting, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite micro-slip.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Density high: one sentence can place star, encode date, and foreshadow blood. Mixed-metaphor guard waived—“threading starlight” is literalized by the candle device. Rhythm breathes with stitch-tempo; clauses tighten whenever footsteps echo. Only faint template cadence in “the stars whisper such lovely secrets” keeps this from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: one sentence can do three jobs (“The shard grew warm in her palm. It had fallen from Notre-Dame...” anchors object, cues backstory, signals causality). Metaphors are clean and non-contradictory; no mixed vehicle. Rhythm accelerates at water-entry, slows at window-touch, matching heartbeat. Final-line dust image is taut.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with morphine ebb—long aqueous clauses yield to staccato crayon scratches. Figurative density peaks only in the final mist-image, justified as climactic reconfiguration. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactile or social detail. One mixed metaphor—“lotus-hearted ache”—slips into therapeutic register, docking 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: single sentences deliver setting, sensory, and metaphoric work (“apple blossoms materialized in gossamer strokes”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (light=honey, memory=seeds). Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” territory—but justified by artist POV. Rhythm breathes with scene temperature. Copy clean; no typos or tense drift. Final line echoes opening’s silk fold, satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: sentence length contracts as coin spins, then elongates in the final reflective beat, creating natural breath. Figurative language is sparse but purposeful—“spiral of interlocking dreams” is the only metaphor, and it is later literalized when the layers rotate. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; each sentence advances image or sound mechanic. A single scaffold stem—“the garden’s reflected sounds suddenly shifted pitch”—could be tighter, but its passive construction mirrors the involuntary acoustic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose shows rhythmic variety; sentences shorten during raid-entry beat—“The door burst open, but Marcus only smiled.” High information density—one line can world-build and advance: “Outside, Thought Auditors prowled… insect wing-beats scrambled their frequencies.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is selective and paid off—“rain” of locusts returns as scanner-confounding tactic. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from reef-shadow compression to star-pinhole brevity; no template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (flower-grenades, crystallized music) advances the photosynthetic rule-set. Information density stays high without purple overload; only hairline slips keep it from 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with ritual: short clauses for heating glass, longer flowing lines for memory descent. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“beautiful and poisonous in equal measure”) but immediacy recovers in tactile orchid shaping. High density: each sentence advances image, task, or cost; no filler. Final line lands clean, recharging “forever found” against earlier “always eluded.”

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet lucid: “extinct language archive beneath Prague’s oldest library” packs place, history, authority in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Mixed metaphors avoided—prism, frost, symphony stay optical/cold/musical lanes. Register stays literary but justified by archivist mindset. Final “clink” is tactile cadence that punctuates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often carries metaphor, causal cue, and emotional tilt (“carved her calculations into its stones, knowing both factions would find them separately”). Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent within geothermal logic; no mixed vehicles. Final line cadence mirrors opening inhale–exhale, satisfying pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythmic variety supports emotional breathing; long sentences for meditative dust-mapping, clipped fragments when past trauma surfaces. Information density high—each sentence layers texture or backstory without scaffold. No mixed metaphors; “rust-red surface catching the afternoon light” is precise. Minor paraphrase loop on “paper trails could be rewritten” vs “rewritten—not through forgery” but does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences open variedly, no template cadence runs. One density flare—“corn whispered in fractured hush, individual stalks speaking different languages of wind”—but it advances atmosphere, not clutter. Closure beat is short, clear, unmarred by scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear clean: varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths breathe with light pulses. High density—“glass bubble pressed against ruins,” “constellation’s reflection triggered luminous responses” packs setting-science-emotion. Zero scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor over-adjectival drift (“gentle green radiance”) but does not cloud closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is wide—participle opens, em-dash insertions, clipped imperatives—creating natural propulsion. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances stakes or acoustics. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“foam fingers,” “pinholes in black velvet”) without density clutter. One near-mixed metaphor: “orchestrated chaos could spin” around a fixed bishop—spin/orchestra clash is minor but keeps this shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse motion, metaphor, world-rule (“moonstone dust… became spontaneously anchored”). No mixed metaphors; celestial and aqueous vehicles stay consistent. One scaffold risk: repeated “between…between…” anaphora—pattern teaches gaps concept, so allowed. Peak-beat clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; high-density lines (“each wave became a moving prism, splitting colors further”) propel without purple overload. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; “darkness clung to the water like oil” is single, apt image. Scaffolding absent; opening anchors voice and stakes in one line. Closing sentence resolves via image that recharges “clear view” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often delivers time, sensory body, and emotional pivot (“He’d made a deal then, unconscious but binding: his innocence for expertise…”). Figurative language is sparse but precise—no mixed metaphors; “molten polyester into skin” is viscerally accurate. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence openings, elastic paragraph lengths, final line resolves by image without exposition dump. Minor resonance redundancy—“ancient choreography” + “slow dance” is purposeful pattern, not synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers science, grief, and geometry. Minor scaffold: “she’d discovered…she’d mapped…she’d found” triplet; one paraphrase loop on “hope equations.” No metaphor clash; rhythm breathes with lantern rises; closing paragraph propels to Charged Poise without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes: long clause for ivy takeover, staccato for diary fragments. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“brittle as autumn leaves” fits burnt paper and world decay. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensorial or causal information. One micro-scaffold: “She photographed each one before touching them, knowing they might crumble” could trim to “She photographed before touching; they might crumble,” but the slight padding never recurs and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Metaphor density is high but purposeful—each figuration (prism, echo, mirror) returns as material cause. No mixed vehicles; “rainbow mist” stays consistent with prior rain-soaked parapet. Scaffolding nearly absent; one near-loop “painted…painting” is voice-motivated. Closure line “mirrors she’d taught to dream” lands clean, no clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: clipboard as both archive and mirror, light color as emotional barometer. No looped phrasing; sentence rhythm modulates from long ceremonial lines to abrupt “We gather as our ancestors did—Not in celebration.” One mixed metaphor: “corona bleeding into corona” is visually vague but thematically coherent. No artifact obscures closure; final line “painful and necessary and true” lands clean. Register stays elevated throughout, justified by ritual frame, so no drift penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence music is disciplined: no two openings repeat, scaffolding pruned, high information density—“each flake catching starlight like scattered diamonds across marble that had never known a lover’s footstep”does three jobs in eleven words. Metaphors stay coherent within light/refraction lattice; no mixed vehicles. Minor loop: “echoes”appears eight times in last third; the repetition is thematic but edges toward mantra. Final lines earn their lyric lift—no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: “meteor hush” and “cathedral echo” recur with shifting valence, taught by line three and paid off in the final sentence. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the acoustic/stellar motif. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“he’d learned,” “he began”) they compress backstory without stalling. One mixed metaphor—“skull of some ancient giant” beside “cathedral echo”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean: “She worked in blushing stillness” carries triple duty—atmosphere, bodily state, temporal suspension. Varied sentence cadence with strategic fragments: “The monarch would understand.” Metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent—moth dust as braille—never mixed. One micro-loop flagged: “tight knot, loose knot, absence” refrain repeats without new pressure at paragraph 3; trims 0.3. Otherwise high density, zero scaffolding, no filter-verb clot.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “bronze still hummed with heat” launches with sensory contradiction; “drops of snowmelt running down like tears of relief” tightens theme to image. No synonym loops or scaffold; information density high—each sentence advances braid, bell, or guilt. Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught (casting/braiding metaphors) and paid off. Clause rhythm modulates with pressure; no algorithmic drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; every sentence advances image, motion, or concept. Sentence rhythm varies from curt—“Water began seeping”—to sinuous cumulative clauses that mimic flood rise. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and causally tied: “origami of time” appears once at closure, paying off the fold pattern. Opening and final lines are propulsive anchors; no scaffolding, no purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences layer ceiling cracks, stellar ratios, and historic plunder. Rhythm breathes with discovery—long cadence for descent, staccato for tile release. One paraphrase loop (“empirically ironic” repeated) costs −0.2. Metaphors stay physically coherent: stone warmth → Mars alignment → bone-resonant hum. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passed: cadence shifts mirror emotional beats. Information density high—single sentence often does three jobs (e.g., “He pressed his palm… feeling the building’s memory… every transformed heart”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within liquid/soundless domain. Zero loops or synonym churn. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “adding this transformation to its endless memory.”

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; every sentence layers job, body, and cosmology: “stars bloomed in the floorboards.” Metaphors are prismatic yet coherent—fog as curious spirits, orchard trunks as pillars of galaxies—intensifying rather than cluttering the climax. Opening and closing lines bookend with mirror-song cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences perform double duty (action + metaphor). Figurative language is selective, never clotted. One paraphrase loop: “no accidents in a mender’s life, only patterns…” restates prior line. Otherwise clean. Opening and closing lines are sharp; final sentence lands with cadenced satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong information density: one sentence often sets scene, stakes, and metaphor simultaneously. Minor scaffold in “blossoms fell upward around her, each petal a moment she had lived, would live, was living now”—three temporal paraphrases where one would suffice. Figurative language stays internally consistent (starlight juice, quantum branches) and never muddles causality. Closing sentence achieves cinematic cadence without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong info density: one sentence can stage, characterize, and foreshadow (“botanical diary grew warm… responding to the mountain’s peculiar acoustics”). Metaphors generally coherent; minor pile-up in “unheard symphony” paragraph but pattern is purposeful. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Final image crisp, earns its uplift without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “rusted calliope pipes singing ghost notes” fuses sound and image in one stroke; no filler. Rhythm varies from staccato ladder climb to longer clause when fog thickens. Occasional poetic stacking (“mineral formations…pink sugar transformed”) risks purple but stays anchored to Marina’s chemist eye. No loops, no template cadence; closing line “that fragment of sister-color” is a satisfying textural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is smooth, high-density, with purposeful metaphor (“shadows cast by objects already removed”). One scaffold loop—“braids creating a map of negative space” echoes prior “borders defined by absence”—but it occurs mid-text and does not obscure the closure image. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; rhythm accelerates naturally as chime approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening shape; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Metaphors stay acoustically coherent—sound carved paths, silence flowered—avoiding mixed vehicles. One near-scaffold: “gently luminescence pulse” could lose “gently,” but the adverb modulates the stone’s warmth and is spared. Final line lands cleanly without figurative muddle, sustaining read-aloud rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or paraphrase; high density—each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are internally coherent (silence like honey, darkness illuminated), never mixed. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“sang,” “consumed,” “erupted”) propel. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line releases image that recharges “conspiracy of light.” Minor elevated diction (“impossible geometries,” “cosmic drift”) reads as sanctioned by POV’s astronomer-adjacent life. No clarity loss at closure; anti-light as “shadows falling upward” is precise and unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The fog had solidified three days ago” delivers world-state, clock, and menace in nine words. Metaphors are few, consistent, and physics-coherent; no mixed vehicles. Paragraph cuts land on perceptual pivots, propelling rather than pausing. One paraphrase loop (“memories… memory” inside four lines) is too minor to ding.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between the incantatory lists and short, percussive bursts that mirror fuse timing. Metaphors are spare and coherent—fortress “breathed green light” fits the moss/life conceit; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often layers mineral cue, color payoff, and emotional charge (“Green phosphorescence mixed with copper blue, creating colors that belonged to no natural star”). No synonym loops or template cadence; line-level craft supports rather than decorates the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “clouds drift below like inverted mountains” does three jobs in seven words. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“silence as presence...silence as...”) but it pays off pattern, so waived. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motif—no scaffold cuts needed.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density—each sentence handles sound physics, emotional tracking, and world detail simultaneously. Metaphors are consistent (light-bending, sound-bending) without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop detected (“silence isn’t absence. It’s presence...”) but it serves instructor function and is paid off by echo reveal. Rhythm varies: longer sentences for drift, clipped fragments for pressure shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“glitching memory” for smart-paint, “seeds” for data fragments—without density overload. Information density is high: one sentence often layers history, sensory detail, and emotional tilt. Only micro-drag: “environmental cycling” is nominalization that could be compressed, but it does not stall momentum or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines carry triple duty: image, emotion, world-rule (“starlight still leaked through the wound”). Varied sentence openings avoid drum-beat, but two successive “had” pluperfects in one early clause create micro-drag. No paraphrase loops; the single mixed metaphor—“thresholds must fade before new ones can form”—is acceptable in a conceptual piece. Closure line (“light the way forward”) avoids fireworks, letting density speak.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varies: anaphoric “She saw…” mirrors wave accumulation; single-sentence climax (“She raised it to the light…”) propels release. Metaphors stay coherent (sound as waves, light as shards). One scaffold: “golden shadows” repeated twice early could compress to once. No mixed vehicles; density high without purple inflation. Opening and closing lines bookend with sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with escalation: long, liquid sentences in orchard rows contract to clipped “He took the puppet’s hand.” Metaphors are coherent—armor dissolving into “necessity of its existence” keeps abstraction tethered to physical stakes. No synonym loops; “possibility” accrues new modifiers each appearance, avoiding repetition fatigue. One hairline slip—“shivering bliss” approaches oxymoron cliché, but the embodied cost (splinters, blood-seeds) grounds it before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers job, motive, sensory hit (“intake form: a handwritten note on Army stationary”). No scaffold; paragraphs cut clean. Metaphors stay coherent (dust braille, spirits released) without purple drift. Minor loop: “tried to say / desperately tried to say” could pare, but doesn’t touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes between descent beats and archive cascade; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Mixed metaphors avoided—“starlight like scattered diamonds” is single layer, quickly functional. One paraphrase loop noted in Q2; no other scaffold. Figurative language is sparse during climax, keeping archival clarity. High information density: one line often performs setting, mood, and plot advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence variety avoids template cadence. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“tableau,” “mercury finding itself”) nudges register drift but stays within Marcus’s inherited-academic lens. No paraphrase loops; information density high—one sentence often layers setting, tool, and emotional charge. Mixed metaphors (“silence had weight and substance”) are intentional, internally consistent, and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but breathable; each sentence at least doubles duty (worldbuild + character filter). No loops or template cadence; occasional alliterative runs (“bridges of bone… bark whispered”) feel purposive rather than algorithmic. One near-mixed metaphor—“moonstone dust rang like a bell made of starlight”—is forgiven because the physical logic (tingle → sound) holds. Final line “decoder of gravity’s rebellious children” lands with crisp resonance, recharging prior arboreal imagery without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “perpetual dampness that rust loved,” “dead leaves danced in impossible spirals.” No synonym churn or scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors stay coherent—waterfall as metronome, compass as orchestrator. One mixed image (“pointing nowhere and everywhere at once”) is allowable lyric compression. Closure beat is uncluttered, preserving 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought: three liquid-metallic metaphors in opening paragraph clutter rather than intensify; “weight carried poorly” edges toward diagnostic speak. Otherwise clean syntax, strong verbs, no scaffold loops beyond the noted name echo. Information density high; each sentence advances image or motive. Final line avoids drumbeat; earns resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Metaphors are coherent (“sunrise… cathedral of gold”) and kept out of high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop—“music that knew its own flaws and loved them”—is forgivable. Information density high; opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long hypnotic sentences for emergence, staccato clauses for data-points. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or numeric information. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“drowning in reverse” is earned. One mixed vehicle: “geometry of survival” borders abstraction, but is immediately grounded in 23° shoulder angle—minor slip, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary fluidly; information dual-loads (e.g., “dust motes spiral through the last shaft of evening light” sets time + atmosphere). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay consistent. Opening and closing lines frame with sonic imagery. Near-perfect clarity, but one register bump—“conceptual repricing” concept itself feels academic for the POV—prevents 9.0.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghost-seeing repairman chasing elevator failures is fresh; coupling it with grandmother’s sabotage timer deepens ingenuity. Specificity of circus ticket booth, sequined ghost accountant, dust-map forensics makes premise memorable. Risk of multiple ghosts handled cleanly. Could swap city for another, but circus+elevator+corruption fusion feels non-obvious.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent within the glass/frost/print field—no mixed vehicles. A single paraphrase loop (“whispers strained against their glass prisons to fill it” echoing earlier prison motif) is the only detectable artifact, minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences multitask (“the shard caught light like frozen tears, its edges singing the old revolutionary songs” sets object, simile, and historical resonance in one stroke). Figurative language is patterned and paid off: mirrors → possibilities → closure argument; crystals → preservation → resurrection plan. No scaffold loops; paragraph breaks coincide with tactical beats. Ear-test rhythm rises toward the ghost reveal, then softens into the final verse. Minor register lift (“conceptual matrices”) stays within Cassia’s intellectual range.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines are dense—"tethering the chip…with threads of pure silver, each one sung into existence" performs setting, action, and metaphor in one breath. Rhythm varies: staccato sentence fragments during rust attack ("brown spots appeared") contrast with flowing anaphora at dawn release. Only two micro-loops: "broken…not broken" and "mend what wasn't torn" echo across paragraphs but serve as patterned mantra, not scaffold. Zero mixed metaphors; copper walls, harmonic rails, and oxidized armor stay physically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean despite lyricism: no filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“stone throat,” “frozen rain”—each image sustains physical logic. Information density is high; single sentences deliver setting, motive, and sensory hit (“She had waited three months for the textile factory above to finally close…”). Clause variation keeps momentum; no template cadence detected. Copy-clean: tense stable, pronouns unambiguous, opening and final lines frame and resolve by image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm syncs to storm gusts: long sentence for turbine-hum, fragment for cut. No loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors (wave/wind/woman spiral) stay coherent to carved form. Minor scaffold: “she felt the presence of those other artists” could lose “the presence of” without loss—still, artifact does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean of loops and scaffold; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “She layered her pigments with the same careful attention she’d observed in the postcards” simultaneously advances action and reprises motif). One mixed metaphor—“summer and darkness in equal measure”—is minor, resolved by context. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the night-work sequences and tightens at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but oxygenated: “wind expose more of the obsidian lagoon” does triple duty—motion, reveal, metaphor. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphor discipline: black water as mirror, library as zeppelin, encryption as courage—vehicles stay consistent. Final line cadence slows to match contemplative re-pricing, avoiding drumbeat syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes—long breaths for memory flood, clipped fragments at dust release. Density is high without purple overload; “concentrated memory-essence” is the only near-redundant phrase. One paraphrase loop: “withered not from plague or war, but from something worse: the slow drain of hope” could trim to “withered from the slow drain of hope.” No mixed metaphor; closure image stays crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Density high: “Akkadian marriage oaths, Etruscan business contracts, Gothic blood promises” packs three cultures into one breath. Metaphors stay coherent: “sound like breaking teeth” fits seismic crack. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. Copy clean; only nit is slightly elevated diction “conceptual repricing” moment, but it aligns with archivist POV.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances seed, time, or body. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“spiral of seeds floating in frozen air” sustains physical logic. No register drift; elevated diction (“entropy,” “causality”) belongs to a three-hundred-year narrator. Opening line anchors voice and stake; closing line resolves by image that recharges “wild serenity.”

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length to mimic wind gusts and hush. Information density high—glue drying, cat vanishing, ravens fleeing each do double duty foreshadowing. Figurative language sparse but precise: cloud surface “smooth as fresh snow.” Final paragraph’s chiming ice crystals extend bell resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: “yellow lantern glass…could perceive not just light, but intention” does triple duty—object, rule, theme. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles coherent. Final line “strength to simply be” risks truism but earns weight via prior embodied specifics. Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraph cuts purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean and image-dense—“broken teeth,” “captured sunset,” “honey in abandoned combs.” No synonym loops or template cadence. Figurative language is spare; when it appears (glass like captured sunset) it charges closure. Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraph cuts coincide with tactical shifts. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the covenant motif. Zero scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong noun-verb pairs—“titanium shell had cracked like an egg”—and只有少数几处叠句式回环（如“time’s texture”重复两次）但均服务于累积模式，不损冲力。无混用隐喻，物理逻辑自洽。结尾句节拍减速，与认知转变同步。无模板化开句，段落长度变化有目的。接近9级，仅因中段有两处相邻句轻微同义回转（“he understood… he could feel”）扣0.2，仍保持高密清晰度。

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet musical: sentence variety, strong verbs, zero paraphrase loops; figurative density is high but patterned early, so the final “hammered gold” moment feels earned rather than ornamental. One minor scaffold—“she thought of the drake itself”—could be cut, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud ear clean; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density high—copper mechanics, mineral glow, tumor antenna packed without scaffold. One mixed metaphor “salt spray on a windless day” is vivid enough to pass. No loops, no filter stacks; final third remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the reveal: long accumulative clauses build pattern density, then snap into short realizations (“We’re the experiment”). Metaphors are spare and precise—“frozen supplicants,” “manufactured quiet”—never stacked. One paraphrase loop: “someone had designed our sacred journeys before we invented the concept of design” reiterates the same idea twice; a −0.2 ding. Otherwise high density, zero filter-verb clusters, clean grammar; the prose propels rather than ornaments.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but breathable: metaphoric layering (“garden would eat the battlefield whole”) advances both image and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds nutrient or ritual detail. Occasional elevated register risks purple but stays justified by the coachman’s philological mind. Final paragraph scaffold (“within a season…”) is the only artifact, a minor drumbeat that slightly dulls closure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“chromatic compass,” “magnetic scripture”—without purple swell. Opening line anchors nose distrust and stakes. No synonym churn or paraphrase loops. Final line lands on image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from short crystalline fragments to longer lyric sweeps without algorithmic pattern. Metaphors are disciplined—void, taffy, lighthouse—each re-used only after taught. No synonym loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “echoed silence.” High density: one sentence often handles sensory detail, emotional state, and world rule.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: “crystalline walls catching colors that shouldn’t exist” does world, mood, and sensory work in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the ice/star motif without contradiction. Rhythm breathes—single-sentence paragraph “The wrongness in the sky began to shift” gives escalation room. One mixed image: “cautious abandon” is oxymoronic but thematically licensed; doesn’t blur causality. Clean grammar and tense.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence openings, no scaffold loops; each paragraph advances either spatial position, acoustic fact, or emotional cost. High density: “She moved through the curved space with practiced steps, her feet tracing letters across the marble floor: U-N-B-I-N-D” does world, habit, and symbol in one stroke. Metaphors stay consistent (acoustics = legislature of the dead). Zero typos, zero tense drift. Close flawless under read-aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances layer or image. Figurative language is sparse and organic—“hidden thunder rolled…that quiet rumble of recognition”—never cluttering peak beats. Information density high: one sentence can convey blindness, navigation method, and emotional displacement. Opening line anchors voice and premise; final line—“she had learned to read the future in mercury, but here she grew it from seeds”—resolves by image that recharges prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (e.g.,“fidgeted productively” advances both character and plot). Metaphors are disciplined—glass-bead rain, pewter sky, woven hush—each reappears to reweight meaning rather than decorate. Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create natural read-aloud rhythm; no mixed metaphors, no register drift. Opening line anchors voice and surreal premise simultaneously; final line resolves via image that recharges earlier thunder motif.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “The forged hush… broke apart like ice in spring” compresses acoustic physics and seasonal thaw in one clause. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—light, water, bone, echo—without purple swell. One mixed image (“flame through dry kindling” for sound) is minor enough not to dull the closure. Final line lands with imagistic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rhythm mirrors collapsing time: clauses shorten as cables snap, propelling to single-line finale. No filler, no loops; each sentence either advances ritual or dissolves support. Figurative language is sparse, chosen for peak beats (“galaxies of reconstructed time”). Opening and closing lines bookend with tactile anchors—trembling hands → blazing crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between susurrus cadence (“spiraling into shadow”) and crisp beats (“She pulled out her paints”). No synonym churn or mixed metaphors; vehicles stay maritime. Information density high: single sentence at mirror crack sets forty-three-year habit and present fracture. Closing shell-image compresses legacy, grief, joy into one stripe.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers scent, physics, memory. One metaphor overload in the opening—“bruise healing into gold”—but it teaches the later color play of cobalt/gold dawn and is paid off. No loops or synonym churn. Tense stable. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual molecules”) momentarily lifts POV diction, but the lyric scale justifies it. Closure line clean.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “bronze foot…anchor her while she worked” performs three jobs—prop, character anchor, metaphor. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for fatigue, staccato for call-and-response. No mixed metaphors; figurals (“cells sang with terrible longing”) are singular and apt. Zero loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Propulsive rhythm: opening sentence rolls a glass eye between fingers while descending—action, object, and motion in one sweep. Figurative language is selective: “trees swaying like hanged men” intensifies gothic stakes without clogging. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Micro-copy clean: no synonym loops, no simultaneity errors. Deduction of 0.2 for one mixed metaphor (“earth and copper and something older”) that slightly blurs taste; otherwise line-level craft supports high-stakes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long, tide-pull cadences to staccato investigative beats, supporting the beam-sweep pattern. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory data, backstory shard, and metaphoric charge—“the Alpine flower, preserved and ancient, felt wrong here at sea’s edge.” No loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative vehicles stay nautical or mineral. The only micro-drag is the abstract noun “isolation” used twice; replacing one with a concrete image would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, varied sentence openings, no filter-verb clusters. Metaphors are fresh yet physically coherent (“promise…sharp as broken glass”). Only a single soft simultaneity—“While crystalline pools reflected scenes that weren’t there”—slips toward poetic simultaneity without temporal ambiguity. Final line cadence accelerates into monosyllables (“He would be ready”) that lock the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent: longer sentences climb, fragments collapse at transformation. Information is dense—every sentence layers setting, myth, and stakes—no scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent (“ember crystals” remain heat-forged, not mixed). One micro-loop: “another queen… another dream… another climb” triplet; because it pays off in closure, penalty is minor. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose mostly propulsive; sentences multitask (veins pulsed / last warmth / failed experiment). One metaphor stack mid-scene—“dying heart at twilight” plus “crystalline veins”—approaches density penalty but pattern taught early, paid off. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts crisp. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge spiral image. Micro-movements narrated only when tactically significant (shell turn revealing columella).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances stake or texture without scaffold. Metaphors are internally coherent—scroll “crackled,” laugh “like bark peeling”—and echo the birch micro-setting. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new temporal contradiction. One mixed-metaphor flick: “mountain paths after an avalanche” beside “chronology tangled” is readable but briefly layers geological and textile images. Final line lands clean, recharging “soar” as simultaneous ascent and surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“fog…like memories trying to enter”). Sentence variety supports the meditative cadence without algorithmic pattern. Copy is clean; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with mirror-like fog/water imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with diverse parts, no template cadence. High information density: “She didn’t draw a rune from any text. Instead, she traced the pattern of her own crystallized skin…” does triple duty—action, theme, image. Figurative language is restrained to peak beats and stays coherent (ink as liquid starlight, shame as shed dust). No synonym churn, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; minor alliteration feels voice-motivated rather than algorithmic. Clean grammar and spatial tracking throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, sound, or motive. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “perfume that glowed faintly green” telescopes magic without excess. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line resolves by image (“empty corked bottle”) that recharges earlier motifs. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: staccato during saw-crack, legato during melody transcription. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentence does world-rule, metaphor, countdown. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors avoided—helix recurs with disciplined control. One dock: “wanderingly exact precision” borders self-contradictory flourish, but is pattern-taught and pays off in closure beat; 0.1 withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences perform multiple labors: “Below, the fjord stretched in perfect stillness, its surface holding the mountain’s reflection like mercury in a basin” fuses setting, metaphor, and thematic setup. No loops or synonym churn; each valve number hits a fresh percussive beat. Metaphors are physically coherent—water as mercury, horizon as calibration mark. Only micro-flaw: “razor-thin slices” verges on cliché, a hairline nick that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught via “rainbows that danced across her equations,” paid off in closure. Clean mechanics, high density, no scaffolding—each line advances atmosphere or interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density: single sentences often do setting-work and metaphoric work simultaneously (“disc had belonged to predecessor… frequencies only the disconnected could hear”). Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Occasional elevated diction (“liminal space,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly lifts POV beyond plausible operator lexicon, trimming the top band. Minor paraphrase echo (“They always did… They always did”) but not repeated enough to blur closure. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—action, sensory hit, metaphor—without overcrowding: “walnut-ink stains…near-black” fuses body, tool, and moral discoloration in five words. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances. Only one mixed metaphor—“sheets of gold” atop “violet and gold” twilight—slightly blurs the water’s surface, keeping this just outside 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances rumor economy, characterization, or atmospheric charge. Varied sentence rhythm mirrors emotional modulation—long compound for lore, staccato for trade. Figurative language is sparse but precise: “grin sharp enough to cut glass” concentrates the entire power tilt. No register drift; technical phrases (“lunar minerals can neutralize certain toxins”) are filtered through character credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence pulses: opening spondaic bark-press, closing monosyllabic stillness. Metaphors are coherent (honey, compass, blaze) and tied to character. No synonym loops; “languages” repeats only with accruing weight. One filter-verb cluster (“she realized it wasn’t leading her somewhere”) in low-pressure beat. Closure line is clean, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The bent light wasn’t just distorted—it was selectively filtered” advances both physics and theme. No paraphrase loops; each return to the pen adds new information (weight, starlight glint, final drift). Metaphors are coherent—cosmic editor, manuscript of spacetime—without mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers imagistic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with sentence variety; no template cadence or synonym churn. Information density high—“vintage camera held no film—hadn't for years”—does three jobs in nine words. Metaphors are coherent: mercury = reflective dispersion, never contradicted by later imagery. One minor scaffold: “mapping silence for three years now” repeats the same fact twice inside 30 words; a −0.2 nudge. No artifacts touch closure beat; final sentence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies, sentences carry double duty; occasional modifier stacks (“volcanic tenderness…infinitely gentle”) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and matches POV. No loops or scaffold; final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with purposeful metaphor chains; no synonym loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphor risk in “auric lagoon/aurora sorrow” is acceptably coherent under poetic license. Rhythm accelerates into short, pulse-like sentences during inversion beat, mirroring cardiac fade—line-level craft supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence moves plot, reveals container physics, or delivers sensory hit. Metaphors stay physical—“aurora painted green fire across corrugated walls”—no mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold stems (“He pulled… He pointed…”) appear but never cluster in high-pressure beats; rhythm breathes where needed. No loops or synonym churn; opening and closing lines bookend with aurora light and rolling gait, giving sonic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long cadence for canal descriptions, staccato for shutter snaps. Metaphors are few but precise—mirror as lighthouse—no mixed-vehicle clutter. One paraphrase loop near end: “darkness teaches us to treasure light” restates Thomas’s insight; minor. No scaffold sentences; high information density—each sentence advances image or emotional pivot. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density high—“magnetic grotto under starlight” does three jobs. One paraphrase loop: “teaching them to question every move the town’s authorities made” restates prior sentence; minor, does not touch closure. Metaphors coherent (library as lung), no mixed vehicle. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high: one line often does description, emotion, world-rule. Mixed-metaphor check clean. Minor scaffold: “rough hands grabbed less often at those who slipped away like tide” could trim two words, but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from staccato ritual (“One stroke. Another stroke.”) to longer lyrical compressions, ear-tested without algorithmic drumbeat. Figurative language is spare—mixed metaphors banned to honor emotional void. Information density high: “curl of wood falling like a secret” does triple duty (tactile, visual, subtext). No scaffold loops; turbine shadows and “spin, spin, spin” are pattern-taught, payoff delivered in final bird silhouette.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Figurative density is high yet each metaphor does double duty: “robes catching blue-filtered light” also signals permission. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical (ice, quartz, breath). Zero loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm—participial openers timed to breath-cycle. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif: humming → “thousand voices.”

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. No loops or scaffold; “gray” recurs with shifting nuance, not churn. Metaphors (glass catching light like sound) stay coherent and physically grounded. Opening and closing lines echo through the reed’s song, creating cadence closure. Micro-issues: two adjectives (“ innocently cunning”) could be one, but the compression fits the 740-word economy.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Occasional softeners—“supposedly,” “slightly off-script”—could be trimmed for iron tension, but they don’t cluster in climax. No mixed metaphors; “cathedral of potential” extends tunnel-to-bell metaphor logically. One paraphrase ripple: “She strikes bells in combinations never tried before” restates prior beat; minor.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long星光 strands and short metallurgical taps, mirroring star-wheel / bench-strike duality. No scaffold or synonym loops; “candle,” “crane,” “ash” recur with accretive, not repetitive, force. Metaphors stay coherent—phoenix half ash half flame parallels Elena’s half-life. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges motif. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “carbonized hard drives” does double world and mood work; “ghost data singing through the walls” personifies without purple stretch. No filter-verb clusters or template cadence; metaphors stay physically coherent. Paragraph cuts are purposeful—each advances knowledge or image. Minor loop: “each black card…darker than the night” repeats the dark conceit, but the repetition accrues rather than stalls. Final line lands with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often delivers world-rule, sensory hit, and emotional tilt (“each mote contained someone’s cherished memory”). No paraphrase loops; metaphor chains stay coherent (twilight → impossible geometries → hurt to perceive). Read-aloud rhythm varies: long clause for descent, staccato for dance. Copy-clean; pronoun “she” always Mira. Final line avoids explain-everything; image carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; paragraph lengths alternate like breath. Metaphors are sparse but exact—“dark aurora,” “glass petals”—never stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Opening and closing lines are mirror-polished, the latter recharging the stone’s witness motif without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for dawning consciousness, crisp fragments at epiphany. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat—avoiding density overload. No loops or scaffold; “circles” repetition is purposeful motif. Strong verbs (“screaming their vegetable grief”) propel without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—one sustained metaphor of incubator/photograph chemistry that pays off in the seed-closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift. One paraphrase loop spotted (“goodbye letters” restated twice in adjacent lines mid-story) but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong density—most lines do two jobs (“Ice crystals formed on her eyelashes, each one a tiny prism splitting the aurora’s light into impossible colors”). Yet figurative layering clusters thickly in final third (“river of stars,” “luminous dust,” “cosmic dust that composed her bones”) risking purple overwrite. Two paraphrase loops detected (“she felt herself fragmenting… each atom remembering its origin” echoes prior stardust trope). Still, propulsion survives; no artifact obscures causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong information density—single sentences world-build, advance plot, paint sensory hit. No synonym loops; “quantum blooms” and “wave functions” recur with purpose, not churn. Metaphors stay internally consistent (bloom-core = condensed starlight) and support physics-poetics. Filter verbs rare and motivated. Final paragraph repeats “fractured lullaby” twice—intentional echo, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety and metaphor density are high yet controlled; no mixed vehicles or template cadence. One scaffold loop: “the hum of insight that promised to unlock something essential” is echoed three times with slight paraphrase, costing −0.3. Otherwise, information density is strong—each sentence layers sound, material, memory. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. The loop appears early, not in closure, so 9+ remains possible in other categories.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual ebb. Every sentence advances atmosphere or interiority—no scaffold. Metaphors are selective and coherent; no mixed vehicular logic. Single paraphrase loop spotted: "gently persistent way the ferry guides had of acknowledging" echoes earlier "gently persistent rhythm," but it is contained and does not touch closure. No thesaurus-itis; diction stays within lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates: short sensory bursts under cold, longer reflective sentences during memory. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent: “something deeper had broken, something in the agreement between sound and silence” is abstract but pays off in the final note. One paraphrase loop: “seven winters… seven years… seven years of surgeries” restates time span; minor, −0.2. Information density is high: bolt, scar, stair-mark, and acoustic lore all delivered within 700 words without pausing plot. Copy-clean: no homophones, tense slips, or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose carries high density—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and mythic data without clogging. Rhythm modulates: languid opening clauses tighten into the single percussive beat “It shattered against stone.” No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are coherent—“ink spread like living shadow”—and vanish before they clot. Opening line anchors stakes; final line returns to graceful circularity, earning its cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: single sentences perform world-fact, emotional charge, and metaphor (“reef blazed with color, before the great bleaching, before the waters rose”).

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and musical but disciplined: “distant suns that had once promised revolution” packs world-history into one clause. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (cathedral, orchestra) stay consistent with setting and theme. One near-purple line—“thunderous serenity of understanding”—is earned by prior accumulation and occurs at climax, not earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. “Sulfur-scented mist… whispered” and “silk scarves in wind” are apt, not purple. Information density high: single sentence mixes insurgent circle, embryo theft, plant intel. One mixed metaphor—“heat rise through her bones like… insurgent spirit”—is minor; clarity intact. Zero loops or scaffold; closure line breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence propulsion: information-dense lines (“Mediterranean natives alongside hardy immigrants”) do world-building while hand moves. Zero scaffold; no paraphrase loops. Metaphor string—drone/wasps, compass/magnetic—stays coherent and brief. Final clause “dirt still dark beneath her fingernails” is irreducible image that lands closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are controlled—The Tower growing roots reads as surreal rule, not accident. One scaffold echo: “she understood now” appears twice within five lines, a minor loop. No artifact touches the closure beat; final line “the universe answered by showing her everything at once” lands clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers image, time-theory, and emotional charge. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay internally coherent (“ink reversing into nothingness”).

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lines carry triple duty (snow/foreboding/mirroring). Mixed metaphors avoided; “harmonics that the building's AI interpreted” keeps physics coherent. Minor scaffold: “every frozen document would begin its programmed release” repeats prior beat; no loops near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective — “prayer made solid” — and never muddles causality. Information density high: single sentences merge setting, body, and symbolism. One paraphrase loop: “the same way these roses bloom… the same way we persist…” costs −0.2, capping 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work—“constellation tumbled lower… new hybrid blooms erupted—part music, part light, entirely impossible.” No template cadence or synonym loops; mixed metaphors are intentional (sound-flowers, star-dream rain) and coherent within fantasy rules. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs cleanly. Occasional elevated diction (“somnambulant giants”) risks register drift but reads as voice-motivated celestial scale.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences often fuse image, backstory, and causality ("Three generations of newsprint fortune built this sanctuary..."). Metaphors stay coherent—newsprint clouds, orbital regrets—no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated phrasing ("crystallized final moment") barely grazes register drift, not in closure beat. Zero loops or paraphrase; sentence rhythms breathe with tension shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Rhythm breathes with task: needle-clicks accelerate, then settle into the hush after resolution. Metaphors stay coherent—amber as lens, ghosts as stars—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often layers time-fold, firmware guilt, and tactile ink. Zero loops or scaffold; even the repeated “meteor hush” modulates from ambiance to earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: one sentence often sets scene + body + metaphor—“chalk-stained fingers trembling as she arranged colored sand into spiraling patterns that seemed to breathe.” No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Mixed-metaphor risk in “milk through water” resolves because both fluids share viscosity logic. Filter verbs serve voice (“she heard it: not quite a voice”), not padding. Final cadence slows to match dissolving pattern—sentence length mirrors scatter. Only niggle: occasional elevated diction—“conceptualize,” “emergent hush”—slightly above street-artist lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and world data (“tessera gleamed crimson…warm despite frost”). No loops or scaffold; each clause advances. Metaphors are consistent—fire, frost, starlight—without mixed vehicles. Strong verbs (“split open,” “shepherded,” “cradling”) minimize modifiers. Final line varies paragraph length to create visual cadence and emotional exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long liquid sentences alternate with fragment beats (“Tomorrow. And tomorrow.”). No scaffold; every sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent within synesthetic rule-set. Only minor loop: “apple trees that bore fruit from different seasons—spring blossoms beside autumn harvests” could compress, but does not dull closure. Opening and final lines anchor and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences do two jobs (action + image). One paraphrase loop: “pathways that were already there” echoed in closing line without new spin, costing −0.2. Metaphors stay physically coherent—light corridors don’t violate optics established. Filter-verb tally low; only two “she felt” in 700 words. Final line avoids explain-everything trap, ends on image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The caves had changed during the Sleep” compresses 200 years without stall. Metaphors are coherent—thermal “constellations” extend to alien “colors” without mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Minor cadence repetition (“Kira… floated… drifted”) but occurs early, not at closure, so caps at 8.5 not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with action—long sentences for archival calm, clipped fragments for echo release. Metaphors stay coherent (sand = dreams, echo = possibility) and never crowd a single beat. One minor scaffold: “shared wisdom” is repeated three times in final third; though thematic, the churn dilutes impact. Still, closure image remains luminous and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “swallowing sound and sight in its silver hush” performs atmosphere while foreshadowing sensory erasure. No synonym churn; “mist,” “hush,” and “silver” recur only when they re-weight meaning at closure. Metaphor remains physically coherent—mist as living thing does not violate world logic. One template cadence appears—“three years…” anaphora—but it is purposefully cadenced for heartbeat effect and is paid off in the final line’s “forged,” justifying its retention.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversified. High information density: “palimpsest of promises” does double descriptive-conceptual work. One mixed metaphor—“sediment… silk curtain”—but does not obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Strong verbs predominate: distills, tangles, foreclose. Final line earns cadence lift with monosyllabic clarity: “stars… newly visible.” Minor over-layering in “ambient awareness” phrase repeated twice; otherwise propulsion clean.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Read-aloud ear varies cadence naturally; sentences avoid template stems. Metaphors precise—moonlight "like mercury," barnacles a "rough border"—and never stacked. High density: single sentences fuse action, memory, tool history without padding. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or register drift. Closing line ("the harbor held her offering now") crystallizes image without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple: sentence length undulates like the library itself. Information density is high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and world data. No scaffold loops; “atomically reflective” is reused with purpose, not churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent (sundial reflecting time, not light). Opening and closing lines are crisp bookends that re-charge the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is dense: “lotus petals seemed to cup the golden light, holding it like cupped palms hold water” performs mirror, hierarchy of hands, and spiritual vessel in one image. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances installation physics or emotional exposure. A single mixed-metor risk—“thread spiraling through every letter like the thrush’s instinctive geometry”—is justified because the piece’s rule-set explicitly equates nature and human pattern. Final line cadence echoes opening, producing quiet closure without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; sentences multitask (“The signals… formed patterns, messages, lies”). One paraphrase loop detected (“subsonic frequencies below human hearing” restated twice) but does not touch closure; minor −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing images—charts, glowing equipment—bookend cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythms vary naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information-dense lines (“encoding rebellion in architecture”) advance both world and character. Mixed metaphors avoided; celestial/stone imagery stays coherent. Only minor scaffold: “the music wasn’t coming from above or below, but from between” reads as purposeful pattern, not artifact. Closure beat free of figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rhythm breathes with drawing strokes: longer sensory sentences for calm, staccato fragments when ribbon is found. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors are controlled—“justice over vengeance until they merged into something unrecognizable” stays within artistic lexicon. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure: longer clauses for archival calm, staccato fragments when sirens wail. High-density lines (“spongey dread… pressed like wet wool”) multiplex sensation and metaphor without coherence loss. Zero paraphrase loops; only near-repeat is “shouldn’t exist” applied to both islands and ships, justified as thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long musical phrases to the staccato of “She played the melody backwards” without falling into algorithmic repetition. Information density is high: one sentence can set scene, backstory, and sensory hit (“amber air of approaching evening”). Two mild scaffold moments—repetitions of “each pixel” and “bridge-song”—are purposeful patterning rather than churn. No mixed metaphors; the wet-plate developing in reverse and the music developing reality stay congruent.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “rusted into the hillside like a wound healing over” fuses tactile setting and thematic foreshadowing in one image. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the circus/highway matrix. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. A single mixed vehicle—“patterns that spelled warnings”—is abstract, but it never obscures causality and sits outside the peak closure beat, so only a nick.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “starlight whisper,” “morse code written across millennia” do double duty (atmosphere + concept). No synonym loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Metaphors stay coherent—daylily/stellar pulse/one-day bloom. One minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” territory—but justified by Mira’s scholar mind. Final line cadence mirrors whale-song audio, earning its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with dive/ascend arc; no template cadence detected. Metaphors (glass trees, living vortex) stay internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. Sentences carry dual duty—description braided with causality. A few adjectival clusters (“impossibly through the water’s surface”) flirt with overwrite but occur early and establish surreal scale, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: urgent enjambment during maze growth, then a caesura before the final cat’s-cradle. Metaphors are coherent—no mixed vehicles—and tied to POV expertise (gardening, scar tissue). Information density is high: “root-bound had made her the only one to notice when the future arrived early” layers backstory, causality, and theme in twelve words. Minor scaffold: “anxious elation” is repeated; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative vehicles stay coherent (veins, cathedral, sediment). One mixed metaphor—“reckless belief that destiny could be negotiated with love”—is earned by prior causality and does not blur closure. High information density with purposeful paragraph cuts propels the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong nouns/verbs—threads worn soft, limestone swallowed sound—keep momentum. One scaffold loop: “remembered…remembered” in adjacent clauses (minor). No mixed metaphors; textile and acoustic metaphors stay coherent. Final paragraph risk of overwriting—“new frequencies” borders abstraction—but cadence earns it. Information density high; paragraphs pass cut test.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary; no synonym loops. Occasional elevated diction (“bioluminescent patterns”) is justified by scientific POV. One scaffold: “She understood these weren’t literal fruits…” tells what the arbor scene already shows. No mixed metaphors; imagery stays internally consistent (magnetic → crystalline → consciousness). Information density high—lines often do double duty (action + atmosphere).

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary length naturally; no template cadence. Metaphors are spare and consistent—tidal atrium, salt-metal tang—never stacked. High density: one sentence often fuses setting, body, and concept (“She adjusted the titan-gear harness that supported her aging spine, the bronze mechanisms clicking softly as she moved between the towering shelves”). No paraphrase loops; “creel” never repeated without new charge. Opening and final lines act as inhalation/exhalation, mirroring ocean rhythm. Minor filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she could smell”).

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Information density is high—“latent radiance that seemed to breathe with the cave itself” does double sensory-conceptual work. One mixed metaphor (“walls… dissolve like salt in warm water”) is minor and emotionally apt. No scaffolding; paragraphs are trim and cut-test clean. The final line’s image of “spiral silence” is crisp, texturally specific, and propels outward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density: single sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Figurative control mostly tight: “dust wheezed out like a confession” marries object to psyche. Minor loop “rivers don’t flow backward / flow forward” repeats concept but cadence justifies. No mixed metaphors; scaffolding minimal. Final line earns resonance through concrete image rather than abstract uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long, misty coils to staccato observations (“The watch grew warm”). High information density: each clause adds new sensory or conceptual data. No paraphrase loops; metaphors are consistent (mist, folding, breathing). Minor scaffold: “documenting the delays” is repeated three times in close proximity. Closure image is clear and charged; artifact does not touch final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “velvet drapes...absorbed sound like a confession booth” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay physically coherent—ice sublimation mirrors cultural erasure. One near-miss: “empires built on stolen songs” edges toward aphorism, but it’s isolated. Final line cadence—“promise that hadn’t lost its glow—it had simply changed color”—gives satisfying circular echo without algorithmic pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors are coherent—crystallized cloud, frozen fractals—mirroring the world’s logic. High information density: “emerald chip pulsed faintly, holding the last warmth of a billion years” packs time, light, scale. No artifact touches the closure beat; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances at least two layers (image + memory, action + world rule). Figurative language is sparse, precise: mist “like silk,” shadows “with the quality of aged wine.” No mixed metaphors; vehicles agricultural, consistent. High density: “she approached it now, her movements deliberate, and began to climb” fuses goal, tool, ritual. Final line cadence mirrors spiral—long sentence coils, snaps shut with “turning on.” Proof-clean; no typos, no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences deliver occupation, mood, and world-rule (“They call us Arbiters, though ‘conscience for hire’ sounds more honest”). Metaphors are clean—lighthouse beam “casting judgment” remains physically accurate. No synonym loops or template cadence; paragraph cuts are surgical. Minor purple alert in “moral fog” and “absolute darkness,” but imagery justifies itself through repetition at closure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from staccato diagnoses to the final long sentence that lets dawn in.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythmic control is deliberate: long sentences float, then shorten for trance ingress; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—mixed metaphors are avoided. High information density: one sentence often conveys age paradox, magnetic effect, and instructional intent. Only minor scaffold: “the familiar sensation of her cells remembering tomorrow” could lose “of” for tighter propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density: one sentence often jobs—image, motion, theme (“Each footfall created small pools…”). Figurative layering is dense but patterned early, so closure beat avoids purple tangle. One scaffold trace: “perfect, soulless precision” and “perfect machines” near-repetition; minor. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters. Final line earns its lifted register because pattern taught it.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but metaphor density crests in the climax (“concentric rings of deep violet”) without pattern payoff, risking momentary swirl. One paraphrase loop: “lanterns rise / lanterns ascent” idea repeats. Otherwise clean syntax, strong verbs, zero typos. Artifact stays below closure-break threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentences avoid template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence layers metaphor, action, and concept. One mixed metaphor (“gnawed like background radiation”) but clarity intact. No loops or scaffold; final line recharges “amber” and “breathing” motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long sentences for dusk contemplation, fragments (“I name you Absence”) for ritual beat. Mixed metaphors (“sky in bruises,” “wax cylinders contained…hollow ache”) stay coherent because emotional through-line is consistent. Minor scaffold: “She thought of him sometimes” could be tighter, but it advances knowledge. No loops or synonym churn; information is dense without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates with the drop sequence—short clauses mirror heartbeat. No loops or scaffold; each line advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, mixed-metaphor-free; “prayer made of stone” is singular and apt. The final line’s quiet cadence lands without syntactic monotony, recharging “impossible was merely improbable” with earned lift.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is mostly crisp—strong verbs (“dissolved,” “warped,” “trebled”) and tactile nouns. One scaffold trace: “Each photograph became a breadcrumb…” repeats the prior sentence’s logic without new pressure. Two mixed metaphors—“rooftops emerged like ancient teeth, dripping with forty years of submersion” (teeth don’t drip years)—slightly blur physical logic. No patterns touch the closure beat; momentum stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “crystallize wonder itself” compresses a lifetime of research into five words. Mixed-metaphor risk is present (“morning simultaneously—an ancient freshness”) but justified by lyric register and pattern-taught repetition. No loops or synonym churn; each image advances knowledge or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors, not scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences perform double duty—worldbuild while advancing choice. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors stay coherent: “silence that isn’t absence but presence” fits fungal communication logic. One paraphrase loop (“growth patterns” repeated in adjacent lines) costs −0.2; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose breathes with micro-variations: “thesis, antithesis, synthesis” mirrors duel cadence. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or motive. Metaphor disciplined—glass jar as both literal container and conceptual womb. Minor over-layer in “historical revision” mentions (three), but cadence shifts at closure, earning forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: every sentence layers motive, world rule, or sensory hook. Figurative control is tight—‘moonlight filtered through willows’ grounds later spatial paradox. No synonym loops, no scaffold clutter. One mixed metaphor—‘electric, waiting, dense with unspoken change’—is forgivable and doesn’t touch closure. Final line earns its hush without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical itself—crescendo of gerunds, then diminuendo of monosyllables matching the fade-out. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent within acoustic physics (“breathing entity,” “fingers of wind”). One near-purple phrase (“ground their happiness into dust so fine”) is earned by prior grief set-up. Closure line is crystalline, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, pressure, or interior shift. Metaphors are spare, never stacked: “obsidian surface drinking light” is the only figurative reach in the climax beat and it lands clean. Information density high—one line slips setting, body, and history: “bare feet…crunched like broken glass beneath her, the same frost that had grown inside her ribs.” Rhythm accelerates across the final paragraph, propelling the step into uncertainty without a single adverbial hedge.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong verbs (“thrust,” “blackened,” “danced”) and high sensory density keep momentum. One mixed-metaphor slip—“frozen bloom of his potential” clashes with molten imagery—drops it from 8+. Occasional elevated diction (“vivify,” “conceptual repricing”) feels slightly above alchemist register but stays consistent. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new heat or consequence. Final line lands clean, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned—“congregation of metal prophets,” “extinct dreams”—and pays off in the final religious hush. No mixed vehicles; physics imagery stays internally consistent. Informational compression is stellar: one sentence slip-streams Guild commerce, grandmother exile, and city origin without stalling. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are surgical. Minor template echo of “every…sang/beat” is purposeful, not mechanical; no loops obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is musical and dense; occasional metaphor stacks (“thousandth crossing dissolve into mist…cliffs phased between solid and ethereal”) risk purple but stay legible. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentence rhythm modulates. One paraphrase loop: “time meant nothing when you worked a vanishing commuter ferry” restates the title concept. Closure image is crisp and unpolluted by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with the walls—paragraph lengths swell then contract, propelling the reader. Metaphors stay coherent (thread as memory conduit, stairs as dimensional portal). One scaffold detected: “As memories alter, so does reality’s fabric” restated twice; paraphrase-loop score −0.2. No mixed vehicles or purple overload. Opening line anchors voice; final line resolves to image that recharges earlier motifs. Information density high; each sentence layers sensation and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with prepositional depth, then compress—“She thought about…” Loops are minor (“navigation…navigate” twice). Figurative language is controlled—one sustained star/water lens metaphor that pays off. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Information density high; each paragraph advances cosmological scale.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Density is high—each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent (mist=breath, amber=cathedral) without mixed collisions. One paraphrase loop: “someone had been harvesting memories, collecting final moments…” repeats concept inside one sentence; trim would sharpen. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero synonym churn, zero register drift; final image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with depth: long sentences in descent, staccato ascent. Metaphors are precise (“corridors like a throat swallowing her backward”) and rarely repeated. One near-loop: “she would return every year… she would stand witness” could be compressed, but it falls outside the closure beat. No mixed metaphors; technical terms accurate. Opening and final lines anchor and release cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory data, interior calculus, and world rule; minimal scaffold. One paraphrase loop spotted (“ink swirled, forming a spiral that matched…” restates prior image) but occurs pre-closure and does not obscure causality. Metaphors stay internally coherent—snowflakes as stars, code as snowfall—no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-ignite motif with quiet variance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances pattern or sensation. Figurative vehicles stay internally coherent (diamond crack = starling gap = language fracture) and never mixed. Information density is high: one clause often fuses world-rule, sensory data, and emotional valence. Rhythm accelerates across night-long carving, then exhales into dawn quiet. No artifact touches the closure beat; flawless line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Information density remains high: single sentences fuse metaphor, action, and world lore (“Her violin sang of locusts leaving shells, of hearts breaking free from clockwork cages”). No synonym loops or paraphrase clutter; each image advances choice or stakes. Mixed-metaphor risk is skirted because vehicles (shell, cage, bridge) all serve the same metamorphic logic. One near-loop—“played herself empty, becoming the shell another’s freedom might require”—is purposeful callback, not artifact, and charges closure, so exempt from penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and imagistic; sentences carry double duty (description + world-rule). No scaffold loops, near-duplicates, or mixed metaphors. Figurative layer (“mechanical ballet,” “cobalt cathedral”) is sparse and patterned—taught early, paid off. Clause density breathes with scene tempo; opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; every line either advances sensory knowledge or tightens atmosphere. Metaphors (“fog like memories refusing to settle”) are clean, non-contradictory, and brief. Minor scaffold appears only in the triple repetition of “misting hush,” but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final “whispering gleam,” so it reads as cadence rather than loop. No artifacts touch the closure beat; the final sentence lands crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet efficient; most sentences carry dual duty of image and theme. One paraphrase loop noted in Q2; otherwise no redundant scaffolding. Mixed metaphors avoided; “shelves breathing like lungs” extends the library-as-organism motif cleanly. Filter verbs minimal; strong nouns/verbs dominate. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No artifacts in closure beat; high-band gate remains open.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean for its lyric load; only one paraphrase loop (“whispers seemed softer, almost grateful”) could be cut. Metaphors stay coherent within light/water register. Sentence variety supports the hush-to-choice arc. Filter-verb clusters absent; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops, no synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Opening line anchors voice and mystery without gimmick. Metaphors are spare and precise—“supernova compressed into a whisper” compresses scale and sound in one stroke. Filter verbs appear only when they serve locksmith distance (“she felt reality reorganize”), not as scaffold. Final paragraph cut test passes: removing it would erase the reweighted ordinary world, the story’s thematic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between tidal sweep and shard-sharp fragments, mirroring surge/retreat of memory itself. No paraphrase loops, no synonym churn; each sentence advances either lore-logic or sensory immediacy. Metaphors are sparse, precise, and internally consistent (mushrooms = moon on water; memories = jellyfish). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “constellation maps” motif. The read-aloud ear test is clean; no drumbeat syntactic pattern or register drift. This is line-level control that supports rather than advertises itself.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Two minor scaffold phrases: “deliberate care” echoes “deliberate gesture” three sentences prior; “shadow twisted…purposefully now” is faint synonym loop. Figurative language is sparse, controlled, never muddles closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long breathy sentences for mist-weaving, staccato fragments for seed-split. High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere + tool + emotion (“With movements both deliberate and fluid, she began to cut—not branches, but the very air itself”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse but precise—vehicles never collide with physical logic. Final line cadence mirrors heartbeat pause, earning resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Each knot held a drowned sailor’s last breath” compresses myth and material into one line. Metaphors stay internally consistent—net as serpent, masks as anchors, starlight as loom—so imagery coheres rather than contradicts. Occasional elevated diction (“exhumed,” “unmoored”) momentarily lifts above the POV’s likely lexicon, but the rhythm earns it. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase drag; every sentence adds fragment, light, or silence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent—long clauses inside the library, shorter strokes as she rises. Only one paraphrase loop (“each loop she freed felt like solving an equation…”) and one mixed-metaphor guardrail (“the ocean accepting her return with quiet recognition”) threaten clarity; neither touches the closure beat. High information density: single sentences layer sensory, technical, and metaphoric work without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: “She tightened the flower press bolt plate…” opens with hard consonants, later lines elongate to mimic server hum. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. One mixed-metaphor risk—“inverted sea of clouds”—but context teaches the image and it pays off at closure, so forgiven. Filter verbs minimal; action verbs (“pressed,” “sang,” “shivered”) propel momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero template cadence; sentence openings vary from participle to noun to adverbial clause. Density is high: one sentence often performs setting, emotion, and causal cue (“Through the scratched glass, she glimpsed something etched inside—tiny symbols that shouldn’t exist.”). Metaphors are spare and precise—“ice cracking from its cables like breaking bones”—never stacked. No filter-verb clusters; immediacy sustained. Final line “tenderness survives” lands as earned percussion without drum-beat repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering—“quietly explosive,” “ghosts of dried lakes”—is selective, never more than one per beat, and pays off in closure image. One mixed metaphor: “spooled wholeness…wrapped like thread on a bobbin” is redundant but does not obscure causality. High information density; each line advances observation or stakes. Minor scaffold in “through the lens, she could see” repeated twice; not enough to breach clarity, so holds mid-8.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“fractally precise” returns in closure), never stacked. Opening line anchors stakes and clock; final line recharges “sky inside walls” motif. High information density: “green with verdigris” does double duty as color and corrosion cue.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, with high information density—each sentence advances pattern, atmosphere, or character. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; the single elevated phrase “stranded luminance, frozen between states” is earned by prior repetition. Sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe, and the final line re-uses “migrations” to close the sonic circle. Minor over-modification in “golden light suspended in the air” is the only hairline excess.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and plot data without scaffolding. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; paragraph lengths breathe with beat shifts. Metaphors are coherent (mirrors = memory, gears = teachers) and avoid purple layering. Only near-micro flaw: two successive “she found / she understood” leads create faint echo; otherwise propulsion is clean. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed vehicles—closure line is crisp artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and info-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional soft intensifiers (“despair made visible”) flirt with cliché but are isolated. Register holds steady; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic—long swells of clause interrupted by single hard beats (“But the puppet head changed everything.”). Information density high: one sentence often layers metaphor, backstory, and future stakes. Minor scaffold in repeated “nested pattern within a pattern” phrasing, but it is motif-driven and pattern-taught, so penalty waived. No mixed metaphors, no simultaneity errors, final line crystallizes without overwriting, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—copper wings catching amber light—never overwrought. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; “graceless beauty” recurs with purpose. Opening and closing lines book-end the arc with mirror imagery (light paths vs. sealing frost). A single participle opener (“checking the temperature gauge”) is sequential and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density—every sentence advances pattern or character; no loops or scaffold; metaphors (foam fugue, neural tributaries) cohere under science-music fusion; final line “three voices becoming one” delivers textural specificity that recharges entire braid motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies, paragraph cuts clean; opening and closing lines anchor and echo. Metaphors stay consistent within glass/liquid/cloud lexicon—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “stories without endings become something else entirely—dreams, perhaps, or wishes, or prayers” could tighten. Filter-verb cluster absent. No artifacts in final third; closure image crystal-clear. Density high, but figurative load borderline; −0.2 for near-purple drift in droplet paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence propulsion is high—each clause adds new sensory or historical layer; metaphors stay coherent (tidal pool as eye, coral as tuning fork). One scaffold hiccup: “stored remorse” is repeated verbatim three times; trim one instance would sharpen. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb bloat; final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, mirroring content; sentence openings vary. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each clause adds new acoustic or emotional data. Figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. Opening and closing lines echo each other (“sentinel” vs “never be silent again”) without feeling framed. Minor tick: “borrowed starlight” is used twice; still, it reweights at closure so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and plot work—“broken periscope mirror catching fragments of stars” simultaneously sets object, stakes, and cosmic scale. Rhythm breathes: long anaphoric cadence under moonlight, staccato tremor beats under injection. No mixed metaphors; Fibonacci/helix vehicles stay coherent. Minor synonym loop “abandoned dreams” repeated four times; −0.2 keeps sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Information density is high—each line advances map, body, or atmosphere. Two small loops: “gravity inversion would begin… gravity’s reversal transformed” compress the same fact twice; “doodles… glowed” repeats three sentences later. No mixed metaphors; imagery is coherent. Closure line is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathy sentences (dawn sequence) to clipped fragments at peak strum. No near-duplicate sentences; each line adds tactile or sonic detail. Metaphors stay physically coherent—electric hum converted to bone vibration—never mixed. Scaffold-free: no “she felt” loops; embodied perception (“porcelain edge coaxing out vibration”) shows without telling.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every image pulls double duty—magnetic nexus mirrors psychic displacement. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Sentence variety propels the twilight momentum without purple drag. A single paraphrase shadow—“patterns they'd never imagine” echoes “patterns within patterns” two beats later—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical without algorithmic monotony; sentence lengths swell and contract like breath. Information density is high—one sentence often does scenery, tool function, and emotional tilt (“Static crackled like distant applause”). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. The single scaffold sentence (“She would catalog this too…”) is purposeful, announcing future ethic, not filler. Minor cadence echo (“the hush of… the hush of…”) is patterned repetition that pays off in choral effect at climax, thus exempt from penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “dew collected from spider webs at dawn” packs time, method, and ritual). No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay within physical logic (“village swayed…like a living thing” is coherent). Two near-miss mixed metaphors (“tide’s thought” / “sap beneath bark”) appear mid-story but do not infect closure; they nick the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sensory flows versus clipped inversion beat. No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“stone formations that hung like frozen waterfalls in reverse.” High information density: one sentence often delivers setting, motion, and emotional filter. Closure sentence lands clean without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong information density: one sentence often advances premise, image, and emotional tilt (“The patch had fallen from his jacket as he'd crossed the threshold”). Metaphors stay precise—containers “like steel flowers following an invisible sun”—and pay off visually. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts tight. Opening line anchors voice and mystery; closing line cadence shifts to slow heartbeat, recharging motif. One micro-slip: “hazy precision” is abstract label twice used; minor but keeps from 9-band perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence variety is orchestral: short percussive strikes alternate with long flowing auroral clauses. Figurative density is high but patterned, taught early, and never muddies causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image adds new sensory fusion. Occasional elevated diction—“oscillating repose,” “conceptual repricing”—reads as liturgical register appropriate to the Basilica rather than authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose carries high density: one sentence does setting, backstory, and emotional charge (“The mountains remembered her failure in their avalanchingly quiet way”). Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“avalanchingly quiet” recurs with payoff—avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each driftwood mention advances spatial or symbolic work. Final line achieves echo without repetition fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Figurative language present but not stacked in peak beats; mixed metaphor screened—vehicles stay airborne/light-based. No synonym churn; “tremor”/“resonance” recur with purposeful escalation. Information density high: one sentence often conveys place, stakes, sensory hit. Closure image crisp, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with paragraph variety; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective, never floods a high-pressure beat. Minor scaffolding: two adjacent “she’d spent / she’d documented” openers could compress. Information density high—each sentence layers science, memory, and image. No artifact touches the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence either advances the loom-action or densifies the Silence-Eats-Sound rule. Figurative layers (pear-rot, sap prison, bamboo breath) stay congruent with physical logic—no contradictory metaphors. Information density is high: “she felt it catch—someone, somewhere” compresses transmission, success, and cost into five words. The closing bead-as-tear image is crisp, luminous, and unmuddled, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between hammer-cadence clauses and blossom-soft pauses. Metaphors are consistent—metal memory, sky-captured blade—no mixed vehicles. High density: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; “floating stone” and “cherry blossoms” recur only when reweighted. No filter-verb stacks; action is direct.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “gravity pulled sideways” packs world-rule, peril, and viewpoint in four words. Figurative language is selective; no mixed-metaphor collisions. Sentence variety is purposeful—long sensory cascade, staccato redirects—creating propulsion without algorithmic feel. One minor scaffold: “the shard had appeared cyclically...” restates the next sentence’s content; a −0.2 ding, not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“wound in the star-scattered sky”—and never muddies causality. Information density is high: one line often does setting, emotion, and foreshadowing. Zero loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—image + physics rule—maintaining momentum. Figurative density is high but patterned and paid off. No paraphrase loops; metaphor logic stays coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif cleanly. One mixed metaphor—“angles that shouldn’t exist”—is fleeting; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath of valley-mist wonder vs. clipped “Teach me.” Information density high—one sentence often does two jobs (“each batch of dye releasing tiny narratives”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally consistent (light-chains, sediment). Register remains within Kael’s artisan lexicon; no thesaurus drift.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lines pull double duty (action + metaphor) without crowding beats: “moonlight touched his weathered hands, and the familiar tingling began” advances both wound and wonder. Mixed metaphors avoided; “grief in angles and arcs” is singular and sustained. One paraphrase loop spotted (“each equation marked a specific kind of loss… the death…”)—minor, outside closure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is music itself; sentence length swells and contracts with hymn cadence. Occasional metaphor density in three successive lines (“maracas filled with dead seeds,” “swaddle emptiness,” “husks rattled”) flirts with overwriting, but pattern matches ritual excess so stays purposeful. Zero loops, no synonym churn. Pronoun and prop tracking clean; greenhouse framework returns exactly as resonating bell.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence starts avoid monotony. Information density high: single sentences combine spatial cue, interior reaction, and paradox tag. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold spot: “staying while leaving” is repeated with near-synonyms in closing paragraph; costs −0.2. Passive voice minimal and purposeful. Clean copy; no typo hits.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. High density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, world rule, and emotional charge (“bread…still warm, smelling of rosemary and time”). One paraphrase loop—“hidden gardens…without permission” / “planted without permission” −0.2. Otherwise no scaffold, no mixed metaphor; closure line clean.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with the scene: long frost-laden clauses for calm, staccato fragments as vault warms—“Not enough.” No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is spare and precise—“warmth seeping from the walls like blood from stone”—one simile, high impact, no muddle. Information density is high: “6.3 on her scale” does double duty (world-rule + emotional verdict). Zero paraphrase loops. Final line “a quartz hush that would echo in Elara's dreams forever” lands as earned resonance, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences pull double duty—action + atmosphere—without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay maritime and metallic. Only micro-loop: “trust breaking…like wet sand…like metal snapping” repeats fracture concept across two adjacent similes, a minor echo. Otherwise density is high, rhythm breathes with tide, and no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often maps taste to magnetic vector to emotional valence. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—ring as compass, palette, destiny—no mixed-metaphor collisions. Sentence rhythm accelerates during auroral convergence, breathes during lavender hush. Zero paraphrase loops; each mention of “taste” adds new molecular flavor. Opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line returns to ring as infinite circle—tight circular cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; only one scaffold loop (“Hours passed, or perhaps minutes”) slows momentum, and it’s outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; sentences often do two jobs (“The fragment had fallen… while she’d been searching…”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (condensation = dissolution). One near-purple phrase—“smelled of copper and regret”—is earned by character POV and momentary intensity. Final line lands with imagistic snap, no mechanical coda. Copy clean; pronoun and spatial tracking flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphors (stone finger, cloud-sea) stay coherent and non-contradictory. No scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. One mixed metaphor risk—“kinetic sculpture that was the tower itself”—but tower-as-instrument is literalized, so forgiven. Final line lands with cadence punch. Minor overcoloring in “indefinable hue between surprise and joy” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: single sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, world-rule. Metaphors stay coherent—flames fold inward like magnetic field lines. Zero paraphrase loops; no “ceramic fingers trembled” re-skins. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line releases image without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences open with varied agents, avoid template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“letters promising to return…bloomed fresh”—and never clusters into purple. One paraphrase loop appears: “objects carried their owners’ endings / Objects carried their owners’ endings” is repeated verbatim; a minor scaffold that dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise information density is high; paragraph cuts always advance knowledge or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence openings. Figurative language (“laboratory breathed”) is sparse and justified. Occasional loftiness—“mysteriously, defiantly alive”—skirts purple but stays in character. No loops, no scaffold, high info-density. Closure image crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; every sentence either advances the salt/flame pattern or sharpens Marina’s interior lens. High information density—“pressed wildflowers grew warm in her pocket” does three jobs in six words. Final line cadence mirrors the first beat, completing a taught spiral of its own.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances spell-craft or deepens atmosphere. Figurative language is disciplined—mixed metaphors are avoided even under pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “smoothed away.” High information density: one sentence can map silence, reveal tool lore, and foreclose future war. Copy-clean.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses mirror Elara’s scholarly mind, then staccato “Teach me” hits apex. No paraphrase loops; each line advances image or stakes. “Cornerstone remembers” personification is consistent with premise. Minor overwrite: “celestial display seemed almost mundane” could compress, but does not touch closure. Final paragraph cadence recapitulates opening meteor image, tightening coil.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence advances memory-tech lore or emotional stakes. No scaffold loops; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Metaphors are precisely mixed only once—“inverse stars”—and serve the beat. Final line’s “memories learning to dance” is earned by prior “resonance structures” setup; no purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence either advances stakes or re-images the marble/aurora interface. Metaphors are coherent—“water finding new channels” foreshadows the confession rerouting history. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are kinetic (“pressed,” “drew,” “climbed”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges “pearl twilight” motif. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates across the burn-beat, then slows into dawn egress.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; metaphoric density is patterned early (“carpet of stars,” “scales of starlight”) and paid off when walls become literal instrument. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each figurative vehicle extends the acoustic frame. Rhythm mirrors subject: sibilant repetition in “serpentine nexus where three canyons converged” mimics echo swirl. One hairline scaffold—”she understood finally” could compress to “she saw”—but it does not touch closure, so cap at 8.9 instead of 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong opening propulsion with varied sentence shapes; occasional poetic overlap (“warmth carving tiny rivulets into walls that had stood frozen for centuries”) is vivid, not muddled. Minor scaffold: “She had spent fifteen years…” summarizes backstory without new pressure, and “someone who could see windows where others saw walls” edges toward template epiphany. No artifacts touch the final image; rhythm tightens in the ascent, satisfying read-aloud test.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information-dense openers: “Marcus Chen picked his way… branches heavy with fruit that glowed” does three jobs in one line. No synonym loops; sentence cadence varies naturally. One mixed metaphor—“frozen lightning bolt” inside a diamond—skates by without logic break. Final paragraph avoids scaffold; each sentence advances exit motion or stakes. Clean copy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence length, purposeful enjambment, sonic repetition mirrors subject. Figurative density high but patterned early (“cobalt glass sang”) so payoff at dawn feels earned. One metaphor muddle: “electromagnetic echoes of collapsed stars” is physically off—collapsed stars emit gravity waves, not radio—but error is obscure and does not touch closure. No synonym loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: every sentence advances image or stakes; no scaffold loops. Metaphors are disciplined—“remembering love through frosted glass” is apt and brief. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, not declarative. One micro-loop: “wound the rusted key three careful turns” / “winding it again” near-end; forgiven because the echo is purposeful reprise, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety propels: fragments at resonance (“she could feel every molecule…”), then lyrical sweep at dispersal. Metaphors are consistent—sound as light, flesh as tuning fork—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new sensory angle or causal link. One minor scaffold: “the artifact responded, its light intensifying…” could trim, but occurs pre-closure and does not dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long lyrical sentences for vigil, curt clauses for rod placements. Metaphors (basalt organ-pipes, ice glass) are clean and non-contradictory; no purple stacking. Info-density high—each sentence advances lunar math or magnetic trick. One paraphrase loop on “frozen lake reflected” and a single filter-verb cluster (“she could feel”) are tiny scuffs below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths contract toward climax. Information density high—single sentences deliver memory, emotion, stakes. One paraphrase loop detected: “memories that weren’t hers flooding… memories cascaded…” −0.2. Metaphors grounded (lantern as promise, rain as baptism) without strain. Clean grammar; no scaffold clutter obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise: “light… like the moment before a music box spring releases” teaches the release pattern that will recur. No register drift; religious lexicon (“absolution, grace”) stays within Marcus’s credible diction. High information density—e.g., “gears smaller than rice grains” simultaneously sizes, amazes, and stakes the repair difficulty. Closure line “sure as grace” is ear-tested perfect cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: most sentences advance world, image, and concept simultaneously. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (“acid sea… dissolved seventeen others”) and pays off in luminescent sky-theorems. One scaffold detected: “Throughout the evolution of mechanical consciousness” appears twice within 60 words—minor loop, not in closure beat. Otherwise rhythm modulates, no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; most sentences dual-task atmosphere and insight. Occasional poetic overlap—“impossible growth and mirrors full of healing glimpses”—slips toward stacked modifiers but never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Metaphors stay coherent within orchard/optic domain. Clean copy; minor hyphenation choices acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, sentence variety, and high density—lace shadow “like neural pathways or river deltas” does three jobs at once. Two minor scaffolding echoes: “song of inevitable collapse” and “symphony of inevitable collapse” within 30 words (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; ice-as-music sustains physical logic. No filter-verb stacks. Closure image is crisp, uncluttered. Lyric compression is purposeful, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings avoid algorithmic patterns. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors per beat—each tied to viticulture, preventing density overload. One near-loop: “amber” used for pavilion, light, and wine could feel repetitive, but each instance reweights the color’s symbolism, so permitted. No scaffold sentences; information is compressed: “tears reflecting flames” does triple work showing emotion, fire, and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is music-box steady; occasional stacked modifiers (“crystalline pillars humming at frequencies just below human hearing”) verge purple but fit the lyric mode. Scaffold minimal—no synonym loops, no template cadence in peak beats. Information density high: one sentence often layers setting, mythic lore, and emotional tilt. Occasional abstraction-itis (“accumulated knowledge of ten thousand years”) keeps this from 8+ band; a single concrete relic or countable memory would sharpen edge. Closure line is clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; metaphors mostly organic but occasional stack (“industrial hardness from their bones”) edges purple. No loops or paraphrase stalls; information density high. Closure line keeps clarity and image-propulsion. Minor over-writing in lavender-as-balm passages prevents 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; sentence rhythms vary from long scholarly cadences to terse final stand. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stance. Figurative language is controlled—three metaphors across 750 words, each re-weighted at closure. Opening and final lines anchor voice and stakes with mirror-light imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “shopping carts filled with VHS tapes… holding conversations and birthdays” compresses entire lifetimes into one noun phrase. Metaphors stay physically coherent—fog as memory, chalk as bone—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for tide pull, fragment for prophecy snap. No loops or filler; every line either advances the sonic hunt or deepens the erosion motif. One hairline slip: “the same force that pulled memories through a human body” skirts abstraction, but is instantly grounded by the tactile TV static.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet textured: every sentence advances image, action, or atmosphere; no scaffold or paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors avoided—“clockwork heart” stays within mechanical register. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph cuts create visual acceleration as noon approaches. No filter-verb clusters; immediacy maintained. One near-slip: “sealed awakenings” repeated three times in two sentences could feel template-like, but the phrase is thematic currency here and each instance changes context, so permitted.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid mechanical patterns. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“belief could bend like willow branches”) stay coherent and sparse—never stacked in high-pressure beats. Information density high: one line often advances atmosphere and character simultaneously. Copy clean; no typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density with rhythmic variation: “The mist became her canvas” carries triple duty—sensorial, metaphorical, causal. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. The only near-purple phrase—“zephyr bloom of dawn”—is earned by prior wind imagery and pays off in the final “soft green luminescence.”

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong verbs (“claimed,” “draped,” “channelled”) and sensory nouns carry weight; few adverbial crutches. Rhythm varies across paragraph shapes; final sentence cascade echoes spreading moss. One paraphrase loop (“here, in the honeyed hush…”) and a mixed metaphor (“marriage of technology and nature”) slightly dent peak beats but do not obscure closure. Otherwise clean, propellant prose.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no synonym loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Occasional cadenced triplets (“erasure and becoming”) risk mannerism yet serve the incantatory release; momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene cadence: longer sentences at dawn, clipped fragments when the vine shivers. Information density is high—each sentence advances image, memory, or transformation. No paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line recharges “arbor” and “stars” without repetition. Minor hedge: “ancient vines spiraling upward toward a sky still bruised” stacks two adjectives upward/bruised, but the physical logic holds and the image is fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences are sculpted, not scaffolded: each does double duty (ex: “She guided it into the pattern's center, where it pooled like mercury made of dawn” advances action, image, and texture). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay internally coherent. Density is high yet propulsive; paragraph cuts create visual rhythm that mirrors the spiral layout. A single mixed metaphor risk—”second sky on the crater floor”—is earned by prior cosmology and does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; metaphor count high but patterned (mirrors, light, echoes) so density penalty waived. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Single mixed metaphor—“cradle of marble” beside “frozen lightning”—is forgiven under lyric license. Closure image is crisp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; each sentence layer-adds like the calcifying fractal itself. Occasional modifier stacks (“something between mathematics and mourning”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful to the textural lens. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase pair: “almost solid, almost real” could fuse to “nearly tangible,” a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: single sentences deliver world physics, altitude, and evacuation history without stall. Figurative control tight—only two metaphors (“like rust,” “worse than the carousel”) and both character-apt. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: “or was it…” repeated twice inside 50 words creates hesitation loop but serves disorientation motif, so forgiven. Closure line is crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences carry double duty—world + metaphor (“water arced in precise parabolas, each stream calculating trajectories”). No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb clutter. One mixed metaphor cluster (“machine for hope…mechanics of intention…physics of purpose”) is permissible at climax. Line-level craft is publish-ready with only hairline figurative overlap.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: long associational sentences in stillness, shorter beats when she touches pocketed letter. Mixed metaphors avoided; “stone in chest” is lone cliché but isolated. High density: single sentence often layers sensory input, memory cue, and emotional valence. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stance or atmosphere. Final line lands with echoing monosyllables—“silence itself could sing”—that recharge earlier tile whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer sentences during drift, staccato final line. No loops or synonym churn; “mirror-black” and “serene upheaval” appear once and pay off. High density—“years of archaeological work had taught her fingers to read surfaces like braille” compresses backstory and method. Closure image is uncluttered, propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long hypnotic sentences for fog, clipped fragments for decoded data. Information density high—each sentence layers tactile detail + cultural history + emotional weight. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “silent snowfall” cliché is instantly saved by “dissolving into weathered planks.” Closing line “rolling eternal across the harbor” repeats ‘roll’ from earlier fog but earns resonance through reconfigured meaning—knowledge now rolls forward.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—long clauses for garden lull, shorter for wrist-pulse climax. Metaphors (incense smoke, golden circles) stay physically coherent. One mixed image—“sky’s indifference”—is minor. No loops or scaffold; high density: one sentence often does description + interiority + metaphor. Final line cadence reprises “lonesome splendor,” ear-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: varied sentence openings, strategic fragments (“Days blurred into nights…”), and no template cadence. Metaphors—palace as “forgotten ornament”, bird song as “music box missing half its pins”—are fresh, consistent with physical logic, and never stacked across high-pressure beats. Occasional elevated phrases (“bitter sweetness of the moment”) flirt with register drift but are earned by context. Information density remains high; each sentence adds sensory or tactical data. No loops, no scaffold, clean grammar and tense throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: “scars can sing if you teach them the right melody” compresses theme and image. No loops; each sentence advances stance or texture. Metaphors consistent—fire, water, volcanic glass—no mixed vehicles. Final line gives rhythmic closure without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    High figurative density is patterned early and paid off; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “defiant hush” appears twice without new charge—minor. Sentence rhythm breathes with emotional peaks; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Clean copy, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and launch angle; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors remain internally coherent—star as flower, gear as clock-heart—and do not collide. Information density is high: one sentence often carries visual, temporal, and emotional data. Minor over-painting in nebula description (“translucent form catching starlight like dew on spider silk”) but image is anchored to POV and does not recur at climax, so closure beat stays clear.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: compound sentences for meditation, fragments for chisel taps. Information density high—one sentence can set season, tool, and emotional hue. Two micro-loops: “through September…through October…” and “Neruda…Rumi…Oliver” list; both serve cadence, not clutter, so forgiven. No mixed metaphors; monarch/ribbon/stone cohere around flight-and-anchor motif.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence does two jobs—e.g., “Each dawn for thirty-seven years, he had climbed… 1,847 turns—never more, never less” compresses ritual, duration, exactitude. No scaffold loops; sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror ascent (short) and confession (long breath). Metaphors are internally coherent: pendulum pause as moral aperture, thicker air as ethical density. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates during climb, slows at pendulum apex, resumes cadence on descent—propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; each paragraph advances pattern or stakes. Figurative layering is high but purposeful, reinforcing textile/garden motif; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided. Two micro-loops: “tender precision” echoed as “tender organization,” “velveteen gloom” repeated; minor, no clarity break. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with sonic snap. No scaffold, no filter-verb clutter; clarity survives peak lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, character, or atmosphere. High density: “predictive models—visual symphonies of probability” compresses science and aesthetics in four words. Metaphors stay coherent—maps as rivers, bureaucracy as riverbed—no mixed vehicles. Paragraph cuts are surgical; removing any clause would collapse knowledge or charge. Peak beat (“she dipped her quill again”) is stripped clean, letting final image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, imagistic, high-density: one sentence often layers atmosphere, character, and plot advance (“She collected the ambient particles… on breath and sound waves”). Figurative language is selective; metaphors stay inside the thermal/light spectrum (ember, glow, foxfire) so accumulate rather than clutter. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Opening and closing sentences are ear-tested for resonance. One near-purple line—“narrative potential spreading through the concert hall”—survives because it is the stakes payload; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: ash as burned records performs double duty—medium and evidence—within single image. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances Stakes, Setting, or Character. Metaphor vehicles stay consistent (ash=time, mask=legacy). Rhythm breathes between portrait completion and incoming sirens. Minor −0.2 for “shattered porcelain shards” redundancy; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, metaphor disciplined: “barnacles creep across marble statues through green-tinted water” fuses sight and moral decay in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes new complicity. No overwritten beats; technical detail (escapement, gear ratios) accurate and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Information density is high: one sentence often layers heritage loss, institutional collapse, and sensory detail—“velvet library absorbed sound like autumn leaves absorb rain” does triple duty. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; verbs are muscular—“breathed beneath,” “unfolding,” “bore.” Mixed metaphors are absent; the autumn-to-music analogy is consistent. Final image is uncluttered, letting the hummed harmony resonate. Meets the 9+ quick test with zero artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density: single sentences layer moon physics, memory biology, and political stakes. Mixed-metaphor risk (“rusted skeleton… constellation maps of synapses”) resolves because physical transformation is literally happening. One paraphrase loop (“memories… memories…”) costs −0.2. Otherwise scaffolding clean; no filter-verb stacks, no register drift in climax lines.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean, varied rhythm; no template cadence or loops. Metaphors ("wings… liquid gold") are sparse, coherent, and serve moment. Information density high—one sentence often does two jobs: "The lightning that the tower collected hadn’t just powered the city—she’d been siphoning traces…" No overwriting in peak beats. Proofing clean. Opening and final lines are crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes—long breathy sentences for tide-hush, staccato fragments when she palms the shard. Information density high: one sentence can map, mythologize, and emotionalize (“mailbox that migrated three inches leftward each month”). Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. One tiny scaffold: “this wasn’t silence—it was the active presence of quiet” could compress, but it pays off in the final hush image, so artifact waived.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences carry double duty: “kelp forests thread through marble archways where roses once climbed” fuses setting, decay, and lost culture in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the underwater logic rather than decorates. Opening and closing lines form a perfect echo of motionless→animate, delivering propulsive closure without scaffold. Only micro-slip: “conceptual weakness” is slightly abstract, but it lands outside the final third and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “probability itself had fractured” does double duty as world-rule and character scar. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances pattern or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—dice wear as entropy agent—without overwriting. Opening and closing lines book-end with the same tactile object, giving arc symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is generally varied, but occasional stacked modifiers (“saffron-tinted smog hung like gauze”) flirt with purple. One scaffold loop—“she’d never spoken them… she’d never spoken them”—is repeated within two sentences. No artifact touches closure, but the figurative density in the opening beat slows momentum before the brush begins its work.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud ear is strong: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. No synonym loops; “rosewater dread” gains menace each recurrence. One mixed-metaphor risk—“tomb of culture rather than its sanctuary”—but the antithesis is earned. Information density high: one sentence can set, characterize, and foreshadow (“the warming temperatures that opened new chambers also accelerated the deterioration”). No scaffold; final line lands with imagistic punch. Minor over-adjectiving in “sweet, cloying scent” but fits curator’s sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“illuminate… consume instead of create”) skirts purple but stays in character. Opening and closing sentences book-end the tide/light reversal with satisfying symmetry. One paraphrase loop—“backward-running clocks… counter clockwise clocks”—costs a hair; otherwise momentum is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies: long fungal sentence vs. staccato “The clasp,” ensuring propulsion. Dense lines carry double duty—smell gag deepens attraction-repulsion theme. One mixed metaphor (“formaldehyde” with “flooding”) but does not touch closure. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line releases carnival silence with resonant punch.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences multi-task (“The mallet grew warm…conducting vibrations up through her arm and into her bones”) without scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent (clouds as sheet music, driftwood as instrument); only micro-slip—“impossible circles” skirts oxymoron but recovers. No loops, no filter stacks, high density.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—short sentences under confrontation, longer reflective clauses when Elara explains parallels. No scaffold loops; “noble lies become ignoble chains” is the only overt aphorism, earned by prior evidence. Metaphors (rose petal, ivy chains) stay coherent and concrete. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“spiral,” “clutch,” “trace”) propel momentum. Copy clean; no tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates: long sensory sentences in calm moments, staccato propulsion during cement sealing. High density—"barnacles crusted the lower walls and seaweed draped the doorways like funeral bunting" does three jobs (sight, metaphor, tone). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Minor register lift ("conceptual repricing") still within surveyor lexicon; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (action + world-rule). Metaphors are spare and precise: algae glow as “dappled resolve” is the only figurative reach, earned by closure. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line resolves by image. One near-filter stack (“she began to recognize”) is negligible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length; opening clause-initial participles are controlled and serve emotional deceleration. High information density: each sentence layers craft, memory, and cosmic geography without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (lantern/crane/gem as grief-vessels). Two near loops: “transform grief into something bearable” echoed by “transformed into something almost bearable” — minor paraphrase, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    High density: “crystalline interior catching the observatory’s sterile light” does triple duty (object, mood, foreshadow). Rhythm breathes—long sentence for grief, staccato for guards. No mixed metaphors, no loops. Final glow is an earned image, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; occasional soft repeats (“perpetual surprise/wonder”) and one scaffold clause (“like movable type, each one a glyph”) slightly dull momentum. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, letting image carry the lift.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language (bruised-purple sky, museum of tempered regret) is selective and never clutters the climactic beat. One paraphrase loop—“weight of withheld truth / weight of unspoken words”—costs a −0.2, but the final sentence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for memory, clipped fragments for apology. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds density—brass weight + grandmother + treaty memory in one beat. Metaphors stay coherent: mist as confession, moon as blindness. Final line lands with monosyllabic thud—“She remained on the windblown stones”—propelling exit.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, varied, and mostly propulsive; sentence lengths modulate to mimic paddle rhythm. Occasional softeners—“perhaps,” “maybe,” “just a short paddle”—don’t stall momentum but cumulatively dilute peak beats. No mixed metaphors, synonym loops, or heavy scaffold. Final paragraph’s “learning to swim in shallower water” is fresh image that recharges prior guilt-sea metaphor without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean; sentences pull double duty (“The cave mouth swallowed him whole” advances + images). Two micro-loops: “glow” recurs three times in 40 words; replace one with “shimmer.” Filter verb cluster—“he noticed,” “he could see”—could trim to direct perception. Otherwise, propulsion is high; no scaffolding, no mixed metaphors. Final image—“another ghost becoming light”—earns its lyric lift without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—scales, feathers, light—teaching the metamorphosis rule. Information density high: vial contents, spice mechanics, and cosmic weave packed without scaffold. One near-loop: “permanent moon” repeated, but second use warms the image, serving reconfiguration rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: each sentence performs two jobs—e.g., "She placed her palm over it, remembering…" simultaneously anchors ritual action and cues backstory. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles (star-drop, card-black snow) stay internally consistent. No synonym loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts test clean. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—accelerated stacking clauses during card fall, then a single short sentence for dawn drop. Minor filter-verb clusters appear but not in high-pressure beats; closure image remains vivid and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors avoided—“oil on water” is single, apt. One paraphrase loop: “never been real except as humanity’s desperate attempt to deny its own nature” restates prior idea; trims −0.2. Information density high; most lines do double duty. Closure image untouched by artifact, satisfying 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is information-dense: each sentence both paints setting and advances conspiracy mechanics. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “light through prisms” stays consistent with sundial imagery. Paragraph cuts are purposeful—every one removed would delete tactical or spatial knowledge. A single paraphrase loop (“quiet certainty… quiet fire”) is repetitive enough to notice but occurs early, not in closure zone, so only minor deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Metaphors (“serpents of green light,” “living equations”) are kept to singular appearances and do not stack. Information density is high: one sentence often layers stone-placement, mythic memory, and bodily sensation. The only hairline slip is “friction failed” repeated twice in close proximity, but it occurs early and does not dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but not purple; each metaphor (star-maps, breathing between spaces) advances concept or stakes. Sentence variety avoids template cadence; opening anchors with auditory creak, closes with hushed “timer ticked on.” One paraphrase loop spotted (“storm moved on, but its electric kiss lingered”) yet it reweights atmosphere, doesn’t stall propulsion. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    High info-density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphor, and concept—“glass atrium caught morning light like a prism, scattering rainbows across the brook”. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops. Metaphors stay coherent (light = code = weapon). Paragraph cuts test passed; each chunk advances stance or code-layer. Minor register lift toward “epistemological doubt” but justified by academic POV and not in peak beat. Closure line clear.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She was rebuilding something precious from the chaos of scattered pages and broken spines” advances action, stakes, and metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each image adds new sensory or symbolic layer. Occasional elevated diction (“clandestine renewal,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within poet-POV lexicon and does not clot momentum. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match the quiet, charged poise of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“needles spinning wildly before pointing toward memories” packs both physics and emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence can world-build (“fantasy islands…clouded sea”), anchor emotion, and foreshadow dissolution. Metaphors are coherent—“petals translucent as forgotten names” extends memory motif without mixed logic. Rhythm varies: fragmentary lightning line accelerates heartbeat before rain. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image advances either stakes or sensory urgency. Final line cadence mirrors the island’s shimmer, closing with oral-story cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and tidal; varied sentence lengths create visual breathing. High information density: one sentence often advances image, theme, and emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful (“mud-caked benches,” “microscopic gifts”), though two adjacent lines slightly paraphrase (“decay and rebirth unfold without interference” / “systems actually heal”). Figurative language is coherent—butterfly dust as data, flood as whisper—but near the end, “profound change happens: quietly, inevitably…” leans toward abstraction. Otherwise, high information density and rhythmic control support accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Frost patterns “teach” her; stars “puncture” darkness; footsteps echo with “ancient voice.” Minor overwriting in one beat (“scorched testament to ambition’s true price”) edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by immediate concrete action (folding the ledger).

    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“time folded and unfolded like origami in four dimensions”) and varied syntax that breathes with scene rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “fractals of light” and “conversations that hadn’t happened yet echoing from the walls” verge on stacked modifiers, but coherence holds.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dirt collecting under her fingernails like inverse stars” does triple duty (image, emotion, theme). Sentence openings vary (“Marina pressed...”; “The whispers grew...”; “She’d been seventeen...”), and paragraph cuts align with emotional beats. One paraphrase loop: “haunted by its price” / “peace but haunted by its price” in adjacent lines. Figurative language occasionally thickens (“resonance structures that shouldn’t exist”) but never muddles closure—the rainbow patterns payoff justifies earlier lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “frost-glazed apertures,” “pearl twilight hour,” “ash that settled like snow” each do triple duty.

    Prose is dense but never cluttered—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“sound like the world’s largest string snapping”) is coherent and climactically earned. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s “second heart” image recharges the mallet motif without redundancy, closing with resonant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “barnacle-crusted borders,” “calcified stairs,” “salt-thick air” do triple duty (setting, mood, character). Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose or mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “spiral” near climax, but not enough to obscure clarity. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts heighten tension. Closure beat (“deep, geological groan”) is uncluttered, visceral, and perfectly paced.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and controlled: “crimson against the rusted tracks,” “glowing with purpose.” Sentences vary rhythmically, and paragraphs shift length to match emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “noble lies become ignoble chains” followed by near-repetition in explanation. Minor register drift in “emotional rationality” label, but quickly offset by concrete behavior. No scaffold or momentum drag; every line serves character, conflict, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose avoids loops/scaffold: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. High information density—e.g., “barnacles crusted the lower walls and seaweed draped the doorways like funeral bunting” conveys decay, mood, and setting in one image. Figurative language is coherent (water as “patient violence,” ink as “space between memories”) and never muddles peak beats. Final line’s “ripples behind” echoes opening drawbridge groan, creating resonant propulsion without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “green-blue glow pulse through water that had claimed this city centuries before anyone thought to catalog its knowledge” establishes setting, stakes, and tone in one breath. Figurative language is purposeful (ink as “dappled resolve,” frequencies “scattered into white noise”) without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slightly ornate phrasing (“tranquilly perceptive purpose”) that risks register drift, but it’s character-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “grinding away layers of raw anguish while simultaneously lifting the essence of love”). Figurative language is coherent—light/shadow/descent motifs never contradict. Minor overwriting in one peak beat (“luminous torment—beautiful to behold yet agonizing to create”) edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary naturally. Final line crystallizes theme without redundancy, recharging “ascending descent” with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “crystalline interior catching the observatory's sterile light” establishes tone economically. Sentences vary rhythmically, accelerating during the alarm. Minor overwriting in “intangibly tangible presence”—a near-tautology—but quickly grounded in concrete examples (unborn children, unfinished songs). No paraphrase loops; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final image (“geode that remembered how to hope”) recharges the opening with earned resonance, avoiding scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “stone eye watching heaven,” “copper light bleeding,” “grinding whisper” all advance atmosphere, character, and plot. Sentence variety supports momentum—fragments for tension, flowing clauses for wonder. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (light as liquid, sound as architecture). One minor slip: “brilliant dimness” borders on oxymoronic abstraction but pays off in final image, so penalty avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “sieved hush,” “salt-worn wood,” “manufactured memories” do triple duty (image, theme, character). Sentence rhythms vary purposefully—longer cadences for reflection, staccato for realization. One minor slip: “tempered regret” borders on label-speak but is redeemed by immediate action (placing the watch hand). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; every line advances atmosphere, plot, or interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “brass drawer pull weighed nothing… yet anchored her” fuses paradox and theme in one line. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mist as scar, moon phases as wisdom) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “furrowed hush” repetition, but rhythm varies skillfully—long sentences for reflection, fragments for tension. Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes with high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “backlash of regrets had broken him piece by piece, each memory a wave eroding his confidence” merges metaphor, character state, and motif. Sentence openings vary (“Marcus traced…”, “He’d been…”, “You heading out…?”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “flickering faith evident in how his eyes kept gravitating” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold mar peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “The cave mouth swallowed him whole” establishes voice and stakes in five words. Figurative language is purposeful (“pressed flowers that refuse to crumble”) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final line (“another ghost becoming light”) recharges the bioluminescent motif with conceptual weight, closing the cadence without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “petals becoming scales, becoming feathers, becoming pure light” uses anaphora purposefully to mirror transformation. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beat (“fur sprouted and receded, wings burst forth and dissolved”)—three modifiers where two suffice—but clarity remains intact. Final line’s moth image pays off opening blossoms with perfect economy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“black snow” cards, “morning glories climbing invisible trellises”) but avoids overwriting—each metaphor advances theme or character. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the card-laying climax. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line multitasks (e.g., “breathing air that tasted of lilacs and lightning” establishes setting, mood, and sensory bias). Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“She understood now…”) resolves without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hull a patchwork of salvaged vessels stitched together across centuries” establishes voice, setting, and theme in one line. Figurative language is purposeful—tears “pulse with memory,” shadow dimension “oil on water”—without muddle. Minor scaffold in “trained her in the old ways… even as wars grew desperate” slightly flattens momentum, but compression elsewhere (“seventeen years past now”) earns density. Final paragraph’s lyricism (“ghostly resolve now transformed into luminous acceptance”) avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in bodily sensation (“weightless with joy”).

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “silk becoming iron becoming starlight” conveys prophecy, texture, and arc). Figurative language is pattern-taught (lightning bugs as “living constellation,” sand as “glass in volcanic fire”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“gritty smoothness of change itself, like black sand becoming glass”) slightly blurs causality but doesn’t dull the ending. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “captured fire,” “calmly inventive,” “death by a thousand paper cuts” each pull double duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching tension. One slight overwriting: “unstop­pable as dawn itself” leans purple but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “reality had crumpled like paper before smoothing itself” compresses cosmic upheaval into tactile metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent (serpents → fingers → equations) and peaks without muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “ghost-eels rose… luminous with understanding”—“understanding” risks abstraction, though immediately grounded by eel spirals matching stone sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“They’d censored her words but given her the universe”). Figurative language is consistent—storms, scars, stars interweave without mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting appears in “electric kiss lingered in the air, charging every molecule with possibility,” slightly inflating an otherwise precise climax. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies naturally, and the final line (“She was learning their language”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brass fingers clicking against the danish tin sewing needle card” does triple duty (character, object, sound). Figurative language is pattern-taught (prism → rainbows → light-trails) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “dignified chaos of their exchange” slightly strains metaphor coherence, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line (“keeping its secrets”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots of calcified coral reaching down through cumulus layers like the inverted branches of some impossible tree” establishes voice and world in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“empirically whimsical,” “luminous doubt”) and paid off in the seed’s “opalescent possibility.” No loops or scaffold—phrases like “flickering between existence and void” earn their weight through context. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors rain and resilience, closing with thematic resonance, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“silver droplets that caught the afternoon light” establishes setting, mood, and visual motif).

Minor overwriting in “kelp that smelled of deeper waters than any around the islet” slightly dilutes propulsion, but rhythm varies skillfully. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final line’s parallelism (“how branches learn… how roots hold…”) earns its lyricism through accumulated pattern.
