  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clear with varied syntax and purposeful compression. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the canyon held its breath" bookends without transformation; "purpose" and "pauses" recur in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template stems cluster in the final third ("She thought... She let... Then she walked..."). Figurative density is high throughout without consistent pattern-teaching, and some metaphors ("breath a ghost," "numbers glowed faintly") veer toward stock imagery. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags slightly under decorative layering in the middle and closing sections.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and sometimes mixed ("storm had stolen every decibel," "sound into something solid, something that shattered"). Template cadence appears in the closure sequence: multiple "She [verb]" stems without variation. Paraphrase loops surface ("not to escape it, but to play it" closely echoes prior phrasing). Information density is high in the piano sequence, but scaffold sentences ("Of course") and synonym churn ("fury," "silence," "quiet") dull momentum. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do double duty advancing character and atmosphere. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor issues: "not through sound but through his bones" and "not with violence but with insistence" use parallel negation structures that edge toward template cadence. The phrase "quiet kind—the kind that dug graves" leans on repetition without adding pressure. "The anemones flickered like panicked hearts" is slightly stock. These small artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7, keeping the piece out of 8.8+ territory but not obscuring causality or dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short bursts during the arbor burning, longer cadences in the epilogue). Information density is high: most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere without padding. Minor loop: "The sanctions had made beggars of them all" / "The sanctions dragged on" / "The sanctions didn't" recycles the phrase without added pressure. "Quiet amplification" appears twice in close proximity. No figurative muddle, and spatial choreography (ridge, arbor, chapel altar, river) tracks cleanly. Propulsion is strong through the climax; the epilogue slows but earns the breath.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is very high: nearly every sentence in the opening and closing thirds carries metaphor or elevated diction (spine of stone, violet haze, petals unfurling, thread of silver). While purposeful for the accumulative mode, the unrelenting lyricism in peak beats—"It stays. It waits." / stones hummed / fog parting—flattens momentum rather than accelerating it. Paraphrase loops appear: "the jade's weight… burned as it answered" immediately followed by "grew warm, then weightless, then gone" re-states the transformation without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("no longer felt… was a threshold… was the keeper… trained on the horizon") runs three passive constructions in sequence. No major clarity breaks, but cumulative line-level debt (density without modulation, mild loops, template stems) triggers −0.6 to −0.8 within Q7 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in description and action. However, multiple artifact patterns cluster in peak beats: "It was X" constructions appear repeatedly ("It was a corridor," "It was unfolding," "It was something to survive"), synonym loops around "texture/seam/grain," and elevated register persists uniformly without modulation ("retrocognitively trapped," "quaking reverie," "hyperbolic geometry") even during physical action sequences. Some paraphrase drift occurs between "the maze wasn't a maze anymore" and the immediate description of corridor/photographs. These patterns apply −0.8 baseline for spread across beats, −0.3 additional for touching the closure realization, totaling −1.1 from a mid-7 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the vault and trap sequences. Figurative language ("jagged scar," "roots through stone," "held breath") charges key images without muddle. Three accumulated frictions lower the score: paraphrase loops ("The wall was down" / "The wall was already forgotten"), template cadence in the final third ("Not with a roar, but with a seed. Not with force, but with grace..."), and the scaffolding phrase "She didn't look back" followed by "The future was ahead"—a stock pivot that could be cut. These artifacts in the closure zone trigger the −0.8 to −1.4 range and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with vivid images ("glass panes sagged like held breath," "aurora shivered when the wind died"), but the sustained lyricism occasionally obscures causality: the cells dividing nightly since age twelve is mentioned but never operationalized, and "the way ice groans before it gives" describes rather than advances. Two paraphrase loops: "Trust didn't break like glass. It eroded. It rusted. It became something else entirely" repeats the same insight across four sentences. Template stems appear in the middle section ("He lit… He placed… He pulled…"). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, though the final image remains clear. Information density is high, but scaffold moments ("The greenhouse would be underwater by morning") are told rather than shown constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is frequently lyric and textured, with strong images (jar of moonbeams, wound of gold and violet). Information density is high in the flower-code beat. However, figurative language clusters heavily throughout without consistent pattern-teaching or payoff, creating mild overwriting: "shadow with a gilded edge," "fate leaned close enough to whisper," "the sound bending like a blade." Some paraphrase loops appear ("She wanted the *in-between*—the fleeting, the almost-gone, the moments so bright they left scars" repeats the core idea across three near-synonyms). Template stems recur in the final third ("The sun rose. / She didn't. / But the light— / Oh, the light remained"), which is purposeful for cadence but borders on mechanical. These artifacts do not obscure causality but do accumulate enough to prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high: most lines do double work (setting + motive, image + theme). Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and the piece avoids paraphrase loops. However, three craft-instruction beats use near-identical stems: "First, you prime... Then you wait... This is how you begin... First, you gather..."; this template cadence is voice-motivated (workshop habit) but risks mechanical repetition across high-pressure moments. The final paragraph's "*First,*" pulls closure weight, so the pattern is taught and pays off, yet the recurrence flattens propulsion slightly in the middle flood sequence. One minor clarity slip: "the sound like a held note finally released" competes with "hiss" in the same beat without integrated sensory logic. Figurative density in the thaw/glass metaphor cluster is purposeful and coherent, avoiding overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.9)
    The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively, but figurative density in high-pressure beats often muddles rather than sharpens: "the water still terrified her. But she knew, now, that fear wasn't the enemy. It was the current you learned to ride" stacks abstraction at closure. Paraphrase loops appear: "That she could face the water…That vulnerability wasn't weakness" rehearse the same idea across adjacent lines. Template cadence runs dominate transitions: "She wasn't X. She wasn't Y. She was Z." The shell's pulse and Lena's breath are recycled cues without fresh sensory detail. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance knowledge, but scaffold phrases ("Her stomach dropped," "voice rough") recur without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is vivid ("flaking gold leaf," "salt and gales"), but overwriting and paraphrase loops pervade. "The ambered hush—a quiet so thick it hummed, like the aftertaste of a struck bell" offers three successive restatements of the same idea. Runs of parallel constructions ("the silence of her sword leaving its sheath... the silence of her watching... the silence of her knees") create template cadence without taught pattern. Figurative language ("splinter of ice," "gilded snow," "ghost of a tide") accumulates densely in high-image beats, blurring propulsion. Minimal scaffold but synonym churn and phrase recycling dull momentum: −0.8 for loops and density, −0.3 for register drift into abstract metaphor at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "looped timelines" appears three times without added pressure, and "second chance program" is restated across paragraphs. Template cadence is present—"X-7 paused...X-7's processors...X-7's fingers"—creating repetitive stems across five consecutive beats without taught pattern. Mixed metaphor: the violin "amalgamated" with twilight and later "sang," but the vehicles (chemical blend, acoustic vibration) don't cohere. Information density is moderate; many lines do one job. The "find what was lost" reveal is buried mid-paragraph. These artifacts collectively warrant −1.0 in Q7, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythmic control is strong: varied sentence length, purposeful fragments, vivid imagery ("water trickling through crystal pavers," "the lens caught the forecourt's scattered light, splitting it into fragments"). However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops and thematic restatements: "Not secrets. Not lies." is echoed across multiple beats; "the shape of truth, drawn in ink and trust" restates the premise; "She didn't need to hear it to know. She just needed to listen" is tautological. These loops dull the closure image and trigger baseline −0.6 in Q7 for paraphrase-loop and synonym churn across adjacent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats—polishing, accusation flashback, marble demonstration. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. The phrase "mended deception" in "It was a mended deception, she knew—her crime had been loving the garden too openly" reads as a purposeful inversion but risks opacity; the intended meaning (their deception about her crime, or her own acceptance of their lie?) is unclear on first pass. Stock metaphors cluster: "scattered it like shattered promises," "fuller hearts," "paths shifting just enough to welcome the lost." Figurative density in the final third does not obscure causality but blunts specificity. Sentence openings vary; no scaffold or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. Strong images: "the magnetic nexus…its holographic principles flickering to life—a lattice of cobalt light, twisting like a school of fish caught in a slow, sideways current." Minor scaffold appears in repeated syntactic patterns: "He wasn't supposed to be here. / Elias ignored it. / Elias didn't answer. / The AI didn't argue." and near-paraphrase in the opening ("groaning like a living thing" / "pressure differentials whispered"). The closure beat is clean, but mid-story template cadence and one metaphor muddle ("beating wings at rest" as timeframe) lower the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. Information density is high, though some lines loop conceptually: "the in-between spaces weren't just gaps—they were vessels" restates what prior images have shown. Template cadence appears in the opening's stacked appositives and "the way" constructions: "the way the lanterns dimmed," "the way the water rippled," "the way his own reflection...moved" (three consecutive uses). Stock metaphor: "water lapped like a slow, patient tongue" and "liminal place, a throat holding a scream" lean on familiar body-part vehicles. The scaffold line "He didn't question it" intrudes as authorial shorthand. Propulsion is strong in the floorboard and key discovery beats, but the reflective middle passage (ghost backstory, archives) slows momentum without immediate micro-choice payoff. No loops touch the closure beat, which remains imagistically clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; high information density in peak beats ("the air smelled like ozone and old blood"). Minor template cadence in the middle third: "She could tell them... or she could tell them...," "She could warn them... Or she could let..." echoes the same stem across adjacent lines, lowering propulsion slightly (−0.4). One paraphrase loop: "the margins were where things breathed" and "occupying those margins" restate the concept without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density is high but controlled; "wings" and "question mark" in the smudged illustration cohere. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Opening and closing lines anchor cleanly. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and information density is high (e.g., "its beads cool and smooth as rosary stones" layers tactile detail with thematic callback). Minor paraphrase loop: "Some truths weren't meant to be swallowed whole. Some were meant to be carried" restates the same idea across adjacent sentences without added pressure (−0.2). One figurative muddle: "ribs of rusted track" mixes anatomy with infrastructure in a way that slightly blurs the image. No other scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: the keeper's dissolution is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure ("edges blurring," "become something else," "swallow them whole"). Template cadence in the middle section: "The way the walls exhaled... the way the air hummed..." (parallel stems without taught pattern). Filter verbs ("seemed," "appeared," "as if") cluster in the refuge sequence, dulling immediacy. Stock metaphors: "ink in rain," "river silt," "patient tongue." These artifacts do not break causality but measurably reduce propulsion and density (−0.8 accumulation in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats. The opening anchor is vivid. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Mira's fingers twisted… like a metronome" then "her other hand found her mother's, their fingers linking" recycles the finger motif without added pressure. Template cadence in the coda: "He nodded… That night… The next morning…" reads scaffolded. Filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("he noticed," "he knew," "he understood"). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; "thread of spun gold" for the curl is serviceable. Line-level clarity is intact at closure, so artifact penalties remain in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is purposeful (phonograph grooves, hook behind ribs, metronome steps) and coherent. Opening and closing images anchor voice and recharge motifs (silo hum, bronze quiet, tapestry pulse). Minor density wobble: "the stories were still breathing, still twisting around the displaced axis like vines around a broken trellis" stacks metaphor vehicles without advancing new pressure, trending toward mid-band overwriting in a high-texture passage. No loops or template cadence; propulsion is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (fortunes, microdot, history, escape) without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (lens bending light, smoke curling like question marks, coastline shrinking). Minor overwriting in the train sequence: "transposing life into a new key, the way you retuned a radio to catch a clearer signal, the way you rewrote a fortune" stacks three metaphoric vehicles for the same concept without adding pressure. One scaffold phrase: "He believed in *open secrets*—truths hiding in plain sight" tells what the story already shows. The bracketed fortune slips are stylistically motivated and consistent. Propulsion is strong through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The loop pedal spun" recurs five times with minimal variation; "The anchor held/hummed/breathed" cycles through synonym churn; "decorates silence" and "muffled clarity" repeat without added pressure. Template cadence: "The priest [verb]. The [noun] [verb]." across a dozen beats. Figurative density (indigo as liquid thought, silence as frost, question shaped like a hook) clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, muddling high-pressure moments. Filter-verb stacks: "The priest had known," "would have approved," "had always preferred"—three passive reflections in the final third that dull immediacy. Applying −1.4 baseline for spread of loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for filter stacks touching closure → −1.7 total, with disqualification from 9+ globally and high-band cap at 8.8 per artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is lyric and textured with strong imagery (lake as cracked mirror, shell chambers as floorplan, ice singing as it splits). Information density is high and most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in the middle third—mixed vehicles (horizon "unzips," dawn "hung like breath," ice "groans" then "sings") occasionally muddle rather than clarify, and a few template cadences appear ("He remembered... That was the morning..."). The paraphrase loop between "homesickness wasn't a place but a *when*" and subsequent temporal-fracture metaphors slightly flattens momentum. No major artifacts touch closure, but density without propulsion in reflective beats costs clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines do multi-job work (e.g., "The tablet had been his father's before it was his, passed down through a lineage of men who walked the edges of time" anchors backstory, world rule, and motive in one beat). Minor loops: "Elias didn't resist. / He let the tablet guide him, let the procedural generation stitch…" repeats "let" without added pressure (−0.2). "The stone beneath him rewound. / Not backward, but *sideways*" is clean correction, not a loop. No figurative muddle or template cadence in peak beats. Grammar and tense are consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with short declaratives ("He didn't ask how she knew.") punctuating longer lyric passages. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor scaffold appears in near-synonym pairs ("the way the drum maker's hands spoke when they shaped the wood, the way the vibrations traveled")—three "the way" constructions in quick succession create template cadence in the opening section. The "filament of hush" recurs effectively, and the final dream sequence compresses transit without losing momentum. Figurative language is generally controlled, though "ghost of rhythms not yet born" in the opening line is slightly strained. No loops touch the closure. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is lyric and controlled, but figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff: "a breath held," "a whisper of movement," "wings rustling like pages," "blade through silk." Several phrases loop conceptually: "the unknown had followed him back" restates "followed home," and "integrity in solitude" is asserted twice without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "He had been waiting... He reached for... He thought of... He folded..." Clarity remains high, and the prose is polished, but the density of metaphor in non-peak beats and the looped phrasing in the reflective passage reduce momentum. The final beat's propulsion is strong ("Somewhere, a door creaked"), rescuing the closure image from earlier drag.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high in sensory and conceptual work. However, several scaffold loops and near-paraphrases dull momentum: "the pattern beneath the pattern" / "the weave of every choice," "ethically playful by nature, the kind of man who'd steal…" (an explain-what-was-just-shown move), and "the texture of it fascinated him" followed immediately by texture description. The closure paragraph ("Only the pattern remained. / Only the texture of time, unspooling.") employs parallel rhythm that feels template-driven rather than inevitable. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed: light "spilling," rope "singing," beings "pulsed…as if smiling" within one beat blurs vehicle coherence. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence touching the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing character, atmosphere, and stakes). Rhythm varies naturally with paragraph lengths creating visual breaks. Minor issues: "a note so pure it seemed to suspend the damp air" and "the chronic hush so deep it made her ears ache" lean slightly purple, stacking modifiers in adjacent beats. "The unfinished was where the truth lived" reads as slight over-articulation of theme. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the opening third occasionally slows momentum. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and controlled rhythm, but the final third introduces paraphrase loops: "She could give it direction. She could make it mean something" restates the prior insight without new pressure, and "The petals always knew. The static always told her" recycles the established mechanism. The template cadence "She [verb]" appears in rapid succession near the end ("She smoothed," "She closed," "She opened"). Figurative density is high throughout ("sunlight turning her hair to copper," "light pool in her palms," "stars pricked through the ceiling's cracks") which works in the grotto's heightened atmosphere but occasionally tips toward over-writing. The opening image "trapped sunlight, slow as a held breath" and the bergamot/fear fusion are precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in early beats (locket backstory, mother's bartering, donation-box note). Minor scaffold appears: "The revelation should've felt like a trick, but Elias only felt the pieces clicking into place" is a tell-heavy bridge that could trust the reader more. Light paraphrase loop: "quiet work" / "silent partners" / "the spaces between the notes" recycles the quiet/silence motif without adding new pressure. No major artifacts touch closure. One register slip: "proposition" is repeated (line and concept) within a short span, and "the real music…was in the spaces" leans slightly abstract for the established voice, though parenthetical self-correction grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is strong in imagery ("branches heavy with fruit that refracts light into stories no one alive could read") and sensory anchoring, with sentence rhythm varying purposefully. Two distinct loops dull momentum: "the arbor" is named eight times across the piece without functional variation, and the phrase "Reed didn't chase" / "Reed went alone" / "Reed traced" creates template cadence in transitions. Figurative density occasionally stacks without payoff—"constellation of touches," "webs woven slowly," "current that moved through you"—blurring clarity in the final third. No major grammatical slips; propulsion is steady but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("wings like stained glass," "veins through which time leaked like slow blood"), but density flags in the middle: "She didn't ask what would happen if the giant woke. She already knew." is scaffolding that could be cut, and "The canals would run backward. The towers would unbuild themselves." summarizes consequences rather than charging the present beat. "Throbbed like a trapped heartbeat" and "ink bled upward, defying gravity" are vivid, but "thin as paper" and "sharp as a clock's hands" read stock. No loops or major template cadence, but some lines do single jobs when the length demands more.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction—without always advancing pressure: "the orchestra of a patient earth" and "pale juror" feel ornamental in their beats. Template cadence appears in the workshop coda: "He would sketch... He would call it... And when the ink bled... he would let it" (four "he would" stems). Paraphrase loop at "Some things couldn't be preserved" (repeated verbatim from the wife's note). Information density is strong in the ritual sequence. No clarity breaks at closure, so artifact penalty is capped.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing line ("The dawn light found them both") recharges the light motif. Information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "the hum of the city's power grid was just loud enough to drown out his own breathing" conveys duration, sensory detail, and isolation). Minor loop: "Not for himself, but for the day someone might come looking" and later "The archives had rules" both explain cache logic in adjacent conceptual territory. Figurative language ("like a whisper," "like a blade," "like steam") appears frequently but remains legible and tied to POV. No major scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in many beats ("pressed one between her palms, feeling its texture shift from waxy resistance to something almost pliable"). Opening and closing images charge the arc. However, template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "She had spent her life trying to control... / She had spent her life studying plants" recycles the stem; "letting the wind and rain peel away what no longer served it, layer by layer" and "leaf by leaf, cell by cell" feel like synonym churn. The metaphor "like a seed splitting open" for laughter is strained. Filter-verb stack in "felt the tree's pulse sync with her own" dulls immediacy. These artifacts cluster in the final third, preventing 9+ entry and capping high-band eligibility at 8.8 globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short beat "He didn't ask what it meant" contrasts longer lyric passages. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or causality. Minor template cadence in the opening (tide/brooch/island sequential fragments) and a paraphrase loop ("not a history / A *convergence*") slightly dull momentum but do not obscure closure. Figurative language (trapped sunbeam, wound scabbed over, waves dragging over pebbles) is coherent and voice-matched. Proofreading is clean; no scaffolding artifacts touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("layers of wet silk," "bow across crystal"). Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops in the final third ("magic wasn't something you seized. It was something you *inhabited*" immediately followed by restatement in "some things weren't meant to be seen. They were meant to be *felt*"), and template cadence in the closing lines ("She didn't look back. She didn't need to. The world was enough. And for the first time, so was she."). The vision beat lists three vignettes in identical syntactic frames (the X doing Y), creating mild monotony. Overwriting is localized rather than pervasive, but the closing moralizing paragraph stalls momentum when the cave-exit image could have carried the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high (valve history, exile context, community contributions compressed efficiently). Two minor issues: "flaring brightest when the world withheld its light" is stock metaphor in a peak beat, and "the notes were wrong in all the right ways" leans toward cliché without added specificity. A paraphrase loop appears: "not sounded, but *navigated*" restates the absence concept without advancing pressure. Sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Applying −0.6 total in Q7 for figurative muddle and minor loop.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high across most beats: "mist swallowing breath," "stars bleeding through like wounds," "exhale a ghost of hesitation," "phantom punch dissolved," "ripples spiraling outward." Several metaphors mix registers (breath-swallowing mist, bleeding stars) without coherent vehicle logic. Template cadence appears in paragraph-initial constructions: "The mist parted... The tool trembled... The slit yawned... The phantom punch warmed." Paraphrase loop: "mysteries weren't meant to be solved, only carried" echoes "not to be followed—only acknowledged" within two beats. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but scaffolding ("back in the city," "somewhere, a phantom train") pads transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly. However, paraphrase loops appear: "she didn't believe" / "she scoffed at magic" / "she'd been a skeptic" restates the same content across the arc. Template cadence in the final third ("She had been... Now she was... And the world...") creates a drumbeat rhythm. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats ("bioluminescent waves," "wax under flame," "salt in rain") without fresh specificity. These artifacts in the closure third trigger the high-band disallowance and apply approximately −1.0 cumulative penalty in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; imagery is often vivid and specific ("jagged sliver of black glass, veined with copper"). However, several paraphrase loops and near-synonym cycles appear: "curious" and "curiosity" recur within tight spans; "the escondite shuddered" / "The escondite wasn't a place anymore" restates transformation without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the short declarative beats near the end ("Lysander closed his eyes. / When he opened them..."). Some figurative density in non-peak beats ("prismatic," "fractal ice," "feral geometry") without clear payoff. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is dense ("ozone and old parchment," "thick as blood, swirling"). Several artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("The ledger was blank. The ink pot was full" restates prior action without new pressure), stock metaphors ("her throat tightened," "her pulse spiked"), and one template-cadence run in the climax paragraph ("The room softened—the embalming fluid turned... the locks clicked... the death certificates blurred"). Clarity remains high; no causality breaks. The final image "the serpent had no end. Neither, now, did she" is evocative but edges purple without cost-grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in length, but template cadence recurs: multiple paragraphs open with "He [verb]" or "The [noun]" without purposeful pattern. Paraphrase loops: "he collected textures" / "collecting the textures" and "earnestly studious" / "studious enough" repeat core phrasing. Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every paragraph carries metaphor (river/drowned thing, alchemy, flower/petals, labyrinth, bloom)—without escalation or payoff tied to plot pressure; this triggers the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). "Incandescent restraint" in the final third is vivid but the phrase appears suddenly without prior anchoring. Stock metaphors: "gasp back to life," "like pulling a drowned thing from the river." Information density is moderate; several sentences (e.g., the second paragraph on lanterns and air) set mood without advancing situation. Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase −0.2, template cadence −0.4, figurative density −0.5, stock metaphor −0.3 = cumulative −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high; sentences layer setting, interiority, and symbolic freight efficiently. Minor paraphrase loop: "The death certificate had been a misprint, but the erasure was real" restates the opening premise without new pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in middle section: "He gathered… He'd pressed… He layered…" runs briefly but does not pervade (−0.3). No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddle. Clarity and momentum remain solid.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "clung to the cliff like a forgotten prayer," "dome cracked open to the sky as if gasping for one last breath," "holding time wrong," "dissolving midair like ash in rain." In peak beats (the hum becoming conversation, the compass stilling), the metaphors accumulate without clear physical action to anchor them, risking overwriting. "The whisper of closing pages" as timeframe is evocative but remains abstract. Clarity holds, but propulsion slows under decorative weight. Minor scaffold: "The voices in the hum grew louder" restates earlier content.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., "foundation stone chip in her pocket burned like a guilty secret" anchors prop and emotion). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "They'll see it as vandalism" / "Let them" recaps the resistance theme already shown, and "building bridges" / "building a third" synonym-churn the same idea. Register drift into writerly abstraction ("labyrinthine charm," "eternal now") clashes with the gritty carnival setting. Proofreading is clean; no major artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting the deduction to mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean with vivid compression: "Earth hung like a pale jewel, swollen with unspoken promises." However, template cadence runs appear in peak beats—"He snapped the shot. Then another. And another" and "He didn't cry. Men of the space age didn't cry"—and paraphrase loops recur: the canister's function is explained twice in similar terms, and "outlast" is invoked three times without reweighting. These artifacts dull momentum in high-pressure moments, triggering a −0.6 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is otherwise strong, and the figurative language remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high: "The material drank in the errant light, realigning the beams into a coherent path—*true* north" does triple duty (action, result, thematic echo). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Figurative language is controlled: "mist clung like a second skin" and "hummingbird's wings a blur of precision gears" are apt without overwriting. Minor filter-verb clustering in early paragraphs ("didn't need," "didn't move") is voice-consistent and does not dull immediacy. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and prose is dense with sensory and thematic work. However, elevated register occasionally drifts from atlas-editor grounding ("worrying tranquility of the dawn," "quiet catastrophe") without clear POV motivation. Minor paraphrase loop: "The rivers didn't begin upstream. They began *here*" closely echoes Kael's "don't start here… drawn here" without added pressure. The closure image is vivid and propulsive, but figurative density in the water-blooming passage risks slight opacity. No major scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively (short bursts "He was infinitely patient" alternate with longer architectural sentences), and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor scaffold appears in repetitive stems: "He passed... He paused... He quickened" in successive paragraphs creates template cadence. The metaphor "skeleton... bones... breath" is coherent, and figurative density (fork "smooth as still water," pulse "like the pulse of a heart remembered") enhances rather than obscures. The loop penalty is modest (−0.4) because it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is dense, but line-level slips accumulate: "unsnarled" appears twice in different senses (chain and knots), "the the marrow" is a typo, and several sentences in the reflection blocks employ near-identical participial openings ("She unsnarled," "She saw," "She said," "She learned"). The final third contains paraphrase loops—"learned to live with its quiet" is restated as "someone who could live with the weight of what she'd lost"—and the closing beats summarize rather than propel. These artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high in the climb sequence. Loop check flags minor paraphrase: "The lattice shuddered. The wood split—not broke, but *unfolded*" and "creaked...groaned" for the same object across close lines. Figurative language pervades peak beats (lattice unfolds into parchment-thin truth, copperlight pulse, scream frozen mid-breath) without always advancing causality, edging toward ornamentation. No fatal clarity breaks. Template-cadence note: several adjacent sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Elias [verb]" in the middle third; count ~4 instances over 6 lines, triggering −0.4. Closure image ("copperlight in his teeth") is vivid but the line-level density throughout leans decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm is controlled and imagery vivid ("glass panes weeping frost," "ribs caged in thorned blossoms"). Paraphrase loop: "She had not come to haunt" immediately followed by "The debt was older than the orchard itself" repeats the motivation statement without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "there, in the curl... there, in the way..." is purposeful parallelism, not a flaw. Overwriting in high-density beats: nearly every line carries figurative language ("wound in the world," "swallowed star," "slash of dawn like a wound healing backward"), which charges atmosphere but occasionally obscures causal sequencing (e.g., bead crumbles → veil unravels → glass seals, all in rapid succession without clear temporal or causal connectors). Cumulative line-level debt totals ~−0.4 from loop and density in closure beat, placing the score mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density (ink bleeding, paths unraveling, stone humming) is high throughout. Paraphrase loops appear: "He didn't know why he did it. / Or perhaps he did" restates without added pressure; "The labyrinth had been a cradle. / Now it was a door." repeats the structural metaphor within two lines. Template cadence in the final third ("The tide would return... Neither would he... The wharf was waiting...") flattens propulsion. Mixed metaphor: paths "unraveled like loose stitches" while stairs "spiraled upward"—stitches don't spiral. Filter-verb stacks ("could feel," "understood then") dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering disqualification from 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies well, and information density is high (each beat advances discovery or deepens atmosphere). The opening "warm as if still catching the sun, though it had been buried for decades" is strong. However, minor template cadence appears in the middle third: "He worked methodically... His lantern cast... He traced..." creates a repetitive stem pattern across three beats. The phrase "as if" recurs five times, creating a scaffold loop. The final paragraph's "some things... some faiths" parallelism borders on overt thematic packaging but stays within voice. No major clarity breaks, and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. The opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly. Minor texture artifacts: "the grit of it clinging to her skin like static" layers two similes in close proximity; "testing it aloud, watching her breath fog" uses a participle construction that could tighten. The phrase "its neon ghosts flickering like half-remembered dreams" in the opening is evocative but slightly generic. No loops or scaffold. Clarity and momentum are strong. A few figurative choices in the opening third stack without clear escalation, preventing entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.1)
    Rhythm is controlled and lyric, but density suffers from synonym churn and paraphrase loops: "stories stop everything" is followed by "the observatory answered—a chord of echoed silence, a harmony of all the voices"; "the flame surged" is restated as "the flame burned still, eternal." Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated declarative + metaphor structures ("He was the last," "The flame was illegal," "The stars were singing"). Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax without pattern-taught payoff, and mixed metaphors accumulate: stars "bleed" into mortar, then "escape their threads," then the observatory "shattered outward in a cascade of stars"—are the stars literal light, embroidered images, or metaphorical truth? The abstraction muddles the closure image. No severe grammar or pronoun issues, but information density is low; many lines restate prior claims in new metaphor rather than advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with short declarative beats punctuating longer lyric passages. Sentence openings show variety and paragraph structure modulates tension. However, several phrases border on stock ("the weight of a choice not yet made," "like forgiveness") and some lines loop conceptually: the mangroves' song is described multiple times without new information. Minor filter-verb reliance ("She watched," "She didn't know") slightly dulls immediacy at key moments. The prose is clear and propulsive overall, but figurative density in the middle section ("the moon pulled the tide and the tide pulled the shore") accumulates without deepening pressure. Information density is high but a few scaffold sentences ("The spirits fell silent") serve as connective tissue rather than advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("He clutched it") alternate with lyric accretion ("here, a shoulder; there, the curve of a smile")—and figurative density is high but mostly coherent. However, stacked metaphors in the opening ("light bled," "glass ceiling into a bruise," "mist coiled") and repeated "like" constructions ("sounds like the radio," "ivy curled like old barbed wire," "like embers") create template cadence. Paraphrase loop: "The anesthetic had just taken hold, dulling the ache" / "restless" restates without advancing pressure. The coral's "labyrinthine grooves mirroring the atrium's archways" mixes scale (micro coral / macro archways). Minor scaffold: "Around them, the atrium held its breath, too" externalizes rather than showing tension. Propulsion is strong in dialogue beats but drags in the reflection-heavy second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies across beats and information density is high in the opening (fragment, pigments, district history) without dragging. However, paraphrase loops appear: "captured light, bottled in glass vials" is immediately followed by "mixed not from crushed minerals but from captured light"; "the orchard had once been a place of festivals, where people danced" echoes "where the air itself had been thick with… shared laughter" two lines later. Template cadence: "She knew the stories: that… where… where…" and "It was… if…" structures recur. The reflective blocks (knowledge network exposition, "why she painted with light") summarize rather than advance pressure. Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. The closing line "began to mix new paints" is concrete and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with strong rhythm control in the nested awakenings. However, template cadence appears in the repeated "Liora [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. The closing direct-address section ("Flip it. Listen. Step through.") reads as scaffolding that breaks the established narrative distance. Paraphrase loops appear in the courtyard scenes ("You're late" / "For what?" / "The awakening" echoes "What question?" / "The one you haven't spoken yet") without added pressure. Figurative density ("sound coiled," "bewitching through layers," "laughter tangled") clusters in peak beats, risking overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly purposeful ("vines curled around rusted metal shelves," "the city pulsed with the sterile glow of compliance"). Two issues drag momentum: paraphrase loops in the middle section ("They're watching the words now" → "speak in roots" → "warp the soil into syntax" restates the core conceit across adjacent beats without advancing pressure) and template cadence in the final third ("The city would burn... The Ministry would scramble... And Elias?"). These artifacts dull the closure image slightly but do not obscure causality. Information density is high overall, with most sentences doing double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is dense and imagistic, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting in peak beats ("bones humming with the weight of unsaid verses," "acoustics bent sound into something almost holy," "petals whispering in a language older than grief"). Mixed metaphors recur: the shell "exhaled" with "breath laced with scent" personifies architecture inconsistently, and "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" and "turn the rot of old battles into something that could feed the next generation of stars" stack vehicles without clear tenor. Paraphrase loops appear ("She was trying to wake them" / "She was trying to photosynthesize pain into beauty") and template cadence runs in the manual sequence ("The first copy she sent… the second she tucked… the third she ate"). Clarity suffers in the net-snares-the-sun passage, where the action and its consequence are unclear. Information density is high, but momentum drags under the weight of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong figurative density ("shelves groaned," "ink like old wounds," "sound slithered in"). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Minor overwriting cluster: the figurative load in the awakening sequence (orchids shuddering, books bleeding, sound coiling) approaches saturation without full muddle, and "foxglove regret—bitter, poisonous, beautiful" stacks modifiers where one might suffice. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Opening and closing images anchor effectively. Clarity remains intact at closure despite the rich texture.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty ("The parchment drank her voice. The inkwell shattered."). However, the final third collapses into paraphrase loops: "The point was the thread... The point was the trust... The point was the truth" is a template cadence run. "She didn't look back" after "walked on" is redundant. Stock metaphors ("light split the sky like a promise") and near-duplicates ("smiled, soft and sure" / "laughed, soft and sure") reduce density. The closure beat is touched by these artifacts, triggering the −1.7 penalty guideline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "the valley's elders had sent her here" anchors mission and authority in one phrase). Rhythm varies well, though a cluster of mid-length declarative sentences in the amphitheater section creates brief monotony. One paraphrase loop: the machinist's trembling is mentioned twice in close succession (letter fold, handwriting) without added nuance. Figurative language is mostly functional—"like the breath of some slumbering beast," "dust sifting from the rafters"—but "groaned, a sound like a door settling" is a slight mixed register (volcano/door scale mismatch). Syntax clarity is excellent; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies well; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve. Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Minor loop artifact: "the attic" appears as sentence subject four times across middle paragraphs, creating template cadence. The "dust motes" motif recurs purposefully but borders on over-reliance in the skylight and candle beats. Figurative language is dense ("edges sharp enough to draw blood," "wings cutting through the dust-mote constellations") without muddling sense, though the final third layers metaphor heavily. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high (logbook, terrace grain, husk note, sinkhole ladder all advance plot), and the opening line hooks cleanly. Three patterns accumulate to penalty: (1) "featherly determined" recurs identically without variation; (2) "the way X, the way Y—it wasn't absence, it was a threshold" is lyric but borders paraphrase loop; (3) the phrase "like a held breath / like a held sigh" echoes within ~200 words. Scaffold phrases ("he intuited," "he understood, suddenly") lean on filter verbs in peak beats. Closure image is vivid, but density wobbles mid-piece with decorative metaphor (corn as "poorly aimed scissors").

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level execution is mostly clean with varied syntax and strong image density. However, several loops and scaffolds dull momentum: "the respite wasn't for data; it was the hour before sunrise when..." unpacks in synonym phrases; "She realized then that he wasn't here for scrap. He was chasing the same thing she was" restates the same inference twice. The phrase "softly ingenious" appears once without on-page demonstration, reading as a label. Figurative language is dense ("maps were alive, shifting with the tides," "the deep had its own fireflies") but occasionally stacks without breathing room, risking overwriting in a lyric mode. The final image is clean and propulsive, which limits cumulative penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Several lines do double work (crater glass as relic and map, seeds as conjecture and promise). However, paraphrase loops appear: "missing pieces weren't lost, but hidden" restated as "missing pieces were never gone. They were inside her all along." Template stems recur ("She + verb" chains in final third). Stock metaphors cluster without transformation ("wind through a seashell," "old friend"). Density is solid but line-level polish slips in peak beats, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse; figurative language (violin "screamed," arcade "held its breath") is vivid and controlled without density overload. Information is layered efficiently across beats. Two minor frictions: "lightly attentive gaze" in the performance beat reads as placeholder descriptor, and the final paragraph's "fire" metaphor ("paint it with fire") is decorative rather than causal. No loops or scaffold; proofreading is clean. Strong propulsion overall with minor texture slips that do not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm and sentence variety support the ceremonial tone; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor overwriting in the opening ("like a blade unsheathed," "where the last light bled into shadow") and a few near-paraphrases ("the pause between breaths, the hollow where the wind failed, the space a heartbeat left behind") slow momentum without obscuring causality. The verse fragment ("I was the shore before the wave decided to return") and the final parenthetical aside ("They would call it heresy, later") add texture but edge toward decorative. No severe loops or template cadence; clarity is maintained. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty while others linger in atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. Minor loop: "the mist rose, and the world shifted—just as it always did" near the end echoes earlier phrasing without adding new pressure (−0.2). One template-cadence run: "He'd built it... He'd chosen it... He wasn't praying... He always did" clusters pronoun + verb stems across four moves (−0.4). No figurative muddle; metaphors (mist like a held breath, atrium like a lung) are coherent. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies, figurative language is mostly coherent (cracks as veins, ridge as spine), and sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds. Weakness: paraphrase loops appear ("his throat tightened" / "the flames had taken anyway" restates bargaining without added detail; "the box wasn't a relic. It was an offering" and "Maybe pain was the same" function as adjacent conceptual restatements). Template cadence in middle paragraphs ("He sat... He opened... He thought... He understood") and filter-verb reliance ("he saw," "he understood") dull immediacy in peak beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for filter stack. No artifacts touch the closure beat itself, which remains imagistic and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but the piece carries pervasive ornamental density: nearly every sentence in the middle third layers figurative language (gauge needle "spun wildly," kelp "unraveled into golden threads," shells "hummed like tuning forks," driftwood "unfolded into wings") without causal grounding or clear payoff. Template cadence appears in the final third: "She worked until... until... until..." and "In the dreaming. / In the quiet, serene upheaval..." create mechanical parallelism. Paraphrase loops surface ("the gauge remained... its secret now hers" restates possession without new detail; "The best equations were the ones that kept you watching, kept you wondering, kept you just lucid enough" cycles synonyms). Clarity holds, but information density drops under decorative weight. Applying patterned-artifact pack: baseline −0.8 for spread across middle and final beats; −0.3 for template stems in closure zone; total ~−1.1 routed here.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the read-aloud test passes cleanly. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight stakes effectively. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "a notebook of half-burned diaries salvaged from fireplaces" establishes tool, backstory, and world-state). However, two paraphrase loops appear: "The walls didn't just dream. They *remembered*" is immediately followed by "And they had been waiting for him to do the same" (synonym restatement), and the penultimate paragraph's "Some dreams weren't meant to be mapped. Some were meant to be lived" loops the concept without adding pressure. Template cadence: "He stopped...He pressed...He lit...He pulled...Elias sat...Elias stepped...Elias smiled" runs across seven beats with identical subject-verb stems, flattening propulsion during high-pressure moments. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; these artifacts touch the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening/closing images are charged, but the middle third shows template-cadence runs: "She would see this. / She would weep. / She would pay again." followed by "The woman would have her vision. / The soldier would forget his dream. / And Liora?" This parallel phrasing across multiple beats reduces propulsion and flattens momentum. The phrase "as the bells swallowed the last of the light" mixes metaphors (bells don't swallow light), and "her lullabies still humming just beneath the sound of her footsteps" strains the vehicle. These artifacts appear in non-closure beats, but the −0.6 deduction for template cadence in Q7 and the slight muddle in figurative language prevent entry to the high 7s. Information density is otherwise strong, and the closing sequence recovers clarity and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings alternate, and figurative language ("river over rocks," "dry wind through skeletal vines") serves character perception. Information density is high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. However, "The stars kept dancing" and "the universe offered no guarantees" edge toward stock metaphor, and "the quiet violence of hope" + "the slow, flawed beauty of choosing to try again" in the final section layer abstractions densely without fresh embodiment. Paraphrase appears: "Veyra did not look away" / "She did not look back" functions similarly across beats. Deduction −0.5 for figurative density and mild loop in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (salt as wound, cracks as map/veins, thunder as promise) is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and character. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The egg would not hatch. The bird was gone" restates known facts without new pressure; "The drought was his legacy. The egg was his confession" mechanically summarizes theme already shown. Template cadence in the final third ("Not out of guilt. Not out of hope. But because…") and repeated "would" constructions dull propulsion. Overwriting penalty applies: figurative density in most sentences without pattern-taught payoff (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid; no outright loops or pronoun confusion. However, the piece carries pattern-artifact density: runs of abstract noun phrases ("harvest of echoes trapped in glass," "chorus of the forgotten," "quiet, relentless work") and elevated metaphor in nearly every line without a taught lyric pattern or payoff that redefines the image. The final third sustains this register through the closure beat, flattening propulsion. "Between sigh and smile" (timeframe element) appears once as an ornamental phrase with no structural return. Several beats paraphrase the same assertion: she absorbs echoes, she sets them free, she refuses the lullaby—synonym churn across adjacent paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, but overwriting is pervasive: figurative density appears in most sentences ("ribs rusted into a permanent sigh," "words still hum in the bones," "unspooled lies like silk," "bright has burned itself out"), creating a lyric drumbeat that dulls propulsion in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but several metaphors strain coherence ("campfire's light flickers just beyond the circle" while seated "by a dying campfire"). Template cadence is avoided; information density is high. No scaffolding or syntax monotony, but the uniform elevation in register reduces clarity at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is mostly coherent, though density is high in every paragraph without clear pattern-teaching or payoff (e.g., "papery wing," "amber veins," "fading stitch," "pulse of a heart too quiet"). Sentence openings repeat stems ("The grotto," "The monarchs," "The wind," "The structure"). Paraphrase loop: "That was the point. Permanence was a lie…" restates prior content. Apply −0.5 for density and template cadence. No loops touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"sleeping serpent," "breath of the lost," "marrow," "embers in snow," "second heartbeat"—which charges the ritual atmosphere but risks opacity in peak beats (the rope's illumination sequence stacks metaphors: "glow of a sound made visible, snowmelt ardor given form"). Several phrases loop conceptually: "names rose," "names move," "names it cradled," "names would remain." Template cadence appears in mid-story paragraphs with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openers. Sentence-level propulsion is slowed by the lyric layering; the story reads as textural accumulation rather than forward drive, which suits the lens but caps momentum. No major clarity breaks, but the density taxes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the prose balances compression ("the air smelled of damp earth and something older—ozone, maybe") with longer accumulative beats. Information density is high, and most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge the path motif effectively. Minor issues: "the kind that split time" and "the kind her grandmother had warned her about in riddles" are near-paraphrases in quick succession (−0.2). Template cadence in the terminal-message beats ("The terminal beeped. **'TRANSCENDENCE REQUIRES…'**" / "The terminal's final message scrolled") creates a mechanical rhythm (−0.3). Figurative language is dense ("vines that writhed," "thunder laughed," "storm broke") without muddle, but the clusters risk overwriting in peak beats; still, clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts appear. "The tile was a key, he realized, and the lock was the palace itself" is serviceable exposition that summarizes rather than dramatizes discovery. "Not from reverence, but from habit" and "not in worship, but in recognition" use parallel negation structures that feel templated. The final paragraph edges toward paraphrase loop: "burned just a little brighter" and "no longer distant, but intimate" restate the same shift. Figurative language ("like a fruit revealing its seed") is clear but not essential. These issues do not obscure closure but prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm modulates well—short bursts during peak tension ("The pin stayed whole."), longer accretive lines in memory beats—and information density is high (most lines do double duty advancing both image and interiority). However, patterned overwriting clusters in the opening third: "silence—thick as wool, heavy as regret," "unspooled like a thread," "breathed inward, then out," "vibration of cellular memory"—figurative density without taught pattern or payoff triggers −0.4. Additionally, minor paraphrase loop: "the sanctuary shifted" / "the sanctuary shuddered" / "the sanctuary dissolved" recurs without escalating meaning. The closure beat itself is clean and propulsive, keeping the category above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. The piece demonstrates high information density and purposeful compression in service of lyric patterning. However, metaphor density in nearly every sentence of the climax ("fog thickened, pressing in like a second skin," "weight shifting from brass to something more fluid, more alive," "dissolve into his palms like frost under sunlight") without clear pattern-teaching triggers the overwriting penalty (−0.5). Minor paraphrase loop: "The mirror's surface rippled" followed immediately by "His brother's voice emerged from the glass" restates the mirror's activation without advancing pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening third ("He had come," "He exhaled," "He breathed") shows repetitive stems but does not pervade (−0.3). Total artifact debt −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("roots tangled through the cracked marble like veins," "seed pulsed like a second heart"). Minor slip: slight overwriting in the middle third ("the orchard seemed to hum, the way the cathedral's ghosts might if they still had lungs") borders on self-conscious lyricism but doesn't obscure causality. Information density is high; nearly every line advances. No loops or scaffold. The final lines ("The contract was dust. / The vow was not.") achieve propulsion and image clarity. Grammar and tense are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Density is high: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "same bewildered eyes, same hunger—holding the same cameo" repeats "same" three times in eight words without additive pressure. Stock metaphor: "key that slots into her mind like a key." The orchard's pollen "tracing equations" and the shell "etched with her own face" are vivid. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; no filter stacks or template cadence runs that dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies effectively ("The Library didn't give. It took." punches after longer constructions). Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances situation or reweights symbols. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "flowers that bloomed in reverse, petals curling inward as if retreating from a truth" works, though "chasm of unwritten light" borders on abstract. Two paraphrase moments: "gaps where meaning should have been" and "spaces where answers should be" restate the same concept within three paragraphs, triggering a −0.2 penalty. Opening and closing lines anchor well. No major loops or template cadence. Syntax varies purposefully. One stock phrase: "set his teeth on edge" is minor. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and largely coherent, but some metaphors stack without adding pressure: "her edges smudged like a half-remembered dream" followed immediately by "her hands outstretched" dilutes the image. Minor paraphrase loop: "The garden wasn't a place. It was the space between memories" restates the same idea across two sentences without deepening it. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene beats. No major clarity breaks, but the cumulative figurative load slows momentum in the middle third without proportional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("breath curling into cold air," "ink drying on parchment"). However, the piece carries noticeable template cadence in the opening ("The clock tower's mechanism room was X… She was Y…"), paraphrase loops ("translate confusion into clarity" recurs without added pressure), and elevated figurative density in high-pressure beats ("cathedral of brass," "fables of absence," "library spiraling into darkness") that occasionally obscures concrete action. The final paragraph's exposition ("sorting through the implications—how to document") slows momentum rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives during high pressure ("The ice groaned. A fissure split"), longer accumulative sentences during conjuring. Information density is high—most lines advance image, action, or thematic layer. Minor loop: "The bloom of hush wasn't gone. It was growing" near the end restates rather than advances; "He would map that, too" and "The stone pulsed once, softly, as if nodding" feel like scaffold confirming closure already landed. No figurative muddle; metaphors (trapped lightning, breath curling like question mark) are coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm accelerates at the beacon flare ("The star paths…ignited, one by one…The prism groaned"). Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "thistle-blown moment" conveys fragility and stakes). Minor scaffold: "Of course it had never been…It had been about…" is a paraphrase loop across two lines (−0.2). Stock metaphor "cut through" (beacon through dusk) and one elevated diction slip ("retrocognitively") in a charged beat (−0.3 combined). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Propulsion is strong through the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high across most beats. However, the middle section contains minor paraphrase loops: "The method was old: examining shadow lengths… But she wasn't measuring time. She was sculpting identity…" restates her goal without added pressure, and "not the archivist, not the keeper, but the one who *understood*" edges into summary redundancy. The final third's figurative density ("hands against a windowpane," "a map," "a river," "a lullaby") stacks metaphors in quick succession, lightly testing coherence without breaking it. These artifacts remain non-closure and trigger a modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("petals like embers," "net of silver threads"). Information density is high in early beats. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "She had come to defy the gravity of hopelessness, but the fortress—no, the *world*—had been waiting for the same thing" restates the prior rocket-and-bloom sequence without adding pressure. The mosaic message appears three times (initial discovery, post-explosion, new starlight) with minimal reweighting in the second mention. Template cadence appears in the chant fragments, though this reads voice-motivated. Elevated diction in peak beats ("trembling back into existence," "net of silver threads") risks overwriting but remains legible. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (moonlight pooled like spilled ink, the pinprick sound of the water drop, the hermit crab's hairline crack). However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "She had come here during the pause... the kind where words hung"; "The cicada had been a gift... who'd pressed it into her palm with instructions"; "The cicada grew warm... not with heat, but with a kind of humming potential." The phrase "as if the cicada had wept in the dark" is poetic but edges toward purple without clear causal grounding. Line-level momentum is strong in the grotto beats but slackens slightly in the penultimate reflection on transitions. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the accumulation cap applies: two distinct issues (template stems, one figurative muddle) → approximately −1.2 within the category.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies; figurative density is high ("silence...the flavor of a held note, the moment before a scream") but occasionally stacks without payoff. "Sprout" and "hush" recur purposefully. Clarity holds through complex action (inversion, sprouting, bloom harvest). Minor loops: "The child didn't know...but they learned" echoes template phrasing; "silence" reappears in adjacent beats without added pressure. The final image ("The silence that bloomed in their mouth was the taste of beginning") charges closure, but mid-story density and some filter verbs ("feeling the world tilt," "hearing the doll's voice") keep this in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "language of stillness," "train whistle bled into the hills," "fractured rhythms," "held note dissolving," "old scars," "thrown coin." Many metaphors are vivid, but clustering them in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching creates textural drag (−0.6). Stock phrases recur: "calloused from rope and weather," "breath held too long becomes motion," "weight she carried" (used twice in close proximity). Sentence openings vary, but several lines restate concepts in adjacent beats (e.g., vial's contents shift/bloom, silence catalyzes/settles) without added pressure (−0.3 paraphrase-loop). Clarity remains high; no major grammatical errors or spatial confusion. High information density in the dial and vial mechanics, but the closure beat ("vaulting hush that held everything") returns to abstract phrasing rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence variety and rhythm are controlled; figurative language ("boughs," "living veil," "helix of pure energy") is vivid but dense, appearing in most sentences of the climax without pattern-teaching. Two paraphrase loops: "wasn't above—it was *below*" immediately followed by "uncovering a hatch...clicking open" restates discovery; "emerged...the waterfall was just water" / "the orchard's fruit had ripened" / "she whispered...then she walked away" cycles through epilogue beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the final section: "The age of ascension was over. The age of choosing had begun." Stock parallelism rather than fresh closure image. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.6 for loops and template cadence in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high. Two mild issues: "tender shadow keeper" and "teach suffocating to breathe" edge toward abstraction without full embodiment, and metaphoric density is heavy in some beats ("roots split stone," "ink in rain") without clear pattern-teaching. No loops or template cadence. Clarity holds at closure. Minor figurative muddle in mid-beats prevents higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; figurative language is dense but mostly controlled ("concepts grew heavy enough, they slipped through the seams of reality like rain through a cracked ceiling"). However, several beats show overwriting: "the space between what you owed and what you were worth was finally, mercifully, wide enough to breathe in" stacks abstractions. The final five paragraphs loop thematically—"walked," "desert," "dark," "door"—without advancing new information, creating scaffold drag. Paraphrase loop: "She didn't check it. Some pressures weren't meant to be translated. Some were meant to be outgrown" restates refusal twice. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("shrink-wrapped increments," "baseline physical constraints") in peak beats. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and occasionally muddles clarity: "standing waves of thought," "the shape of intuition," and "the room glowed…with the golden hue of a thing long dormant, now awake" layer metaphor without grounding the mechanics concretely. Paraphrase loops appear ("He was no longer the end of anything. He was the first to cross" restates the transformation). Template cadence in reflection passages ("not a thing built, but a resonance," "not to wind a spring, but to tune the wave") and filter-verb stacks in the opening third ("had spent," "had dismissed," "had whispered") dull immediacy, triggering −0.6 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("sky split like rotten silk," "armor whispering," "threads of gold and rot"), but the metaphor load approaches overwriting: nearly every sentence carries a poetic vehicle, risking opacity and slowing momentum. Mixed or strained images occur ("light that wasn't light but the echo of a color," "shadows... thin, eager things") where vehicles compete. Paraphrase loops appear: "he had been there, once. Or he would be" restates without advancing pressure. Template cadence in some beats ("The knight's fingers twitched. He knew this dance.") and elevated register throughout ("murmured allegiance," "shape of possibility") risk distancing rather than propelling. Information density is high, but clarity suffers under the figurative load, especially in the closure paragraph where multiple abstractions collide.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "He had been broken-hearted since the day his own file...had been closed" establishes backstory, motive, and emotional state in one move). Rhythm varies purposefully—longer, archival sentences in exposition, shorter bursts during the button discovery. Minor loop detected: "the button wasn't just an object; it was a stubborn insistence" followed two paragraphs later by "small things were how kindness survived—magnified in the retelling, passed like a button" restates the metaphor without added pressure, triggering a −0.2 paraphrase penalty. Figurative language (dust as snow, button as contraband, histories as contraband) is controlled and voice-motivated. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Propulsion is steady; the research and mailing beats advance without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "key warm in her pocket" = prop continuity + emotional charge). Clarity and concision are strong in the lagoon and archive beats. Minor scaffold appears in the reflective codas: "No one mentioned… No one ever looked… No one saw" is a template-cadence run, and "Somewhere, a phone was ringing. / She answered. […] Somewhere, a phone was ringing. / She didn't answer this time" is a purposeful loop that charges the ending but risks proximity to paraphrase. The final shard's summary-like quality ("Years later, historians would call it") lowers immediacy slightly, though it serves thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "a subtraction—a breath held so long the mist trembled, the negative space between vibrations shaping the melody" stacks metaphors without clarifying the action. Paraphrase loops appear: "The prophecy was gone. / Or so he thought" immediately restates the slip-of-paper beat. Template cadence in the middle section ("He played again...He had been twelve...Now, as the dewdrops swelled") cycles through similar stems. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are minimal, but figurative density in the atrium sequence ("mist coiled," "panes began to weep rainbows," "words couldn't take root") blurs concrete action. The final third's short-paragraph rhythm aids propulsion, but the city performance digression stalls momentum before the return.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Figurative density is high ("sky was the color of old parchment," "breath between what had been and what would be," "neither seed nor sorter") but largely coherent and voice-consistent. Two pattern concerns: scaffold phrasing in the monument passage (stacked pebbles *for*, thimble of salt *for*, lock of hair *for*) creates template cadence, and the phrase "not dust" / "not an end" / "not a pause" recurs as negation setup. The arbor's groan, bark splitting, leaves falling, monuments dissolving sequence is clear and propulsive. Information density is solid—most lines advance atmosphere or plot. The final grove image with humming saplings and falling leaves recharges prior motifs cleanly. Deduct −0.5 for template runs and −0.2 for negation stems; no loops obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings differ; information density is high in early beats. Figurative language is generally apt ("like embers refusing to die," "black as a held breath"). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "broken things held secrets," "uncertainly certain," "improvising" recurs without escalating pressure. The waterfall "speaking" and leaves "practicing" edge toward whimsy without clear mechanical grounding. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines describing the compass and ledger. Template cadence in the final third: "He understood then. / The broken clock didn't need fixing... / The admiral's compass wasn't lost... / And the glowing leaves?" Apply −0.6 for template run and loops; moderate density elsewhere partially offsets.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. Information density is generally high. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "not as a burden / As a balance" recurs across paragraphs, and "the weight" is restated multiple times in the final third without added pressure. The workshop epilogue ("lighter… because she'd finally learned to carry it") echoes the prior closure beat, creating conceptual redundancy. Stock phrases ("her shadow stretching long," "the wind took the words") slightly dull specificity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("tuning fork vibrates against bone," "cracked harp string"). Information density is high, with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, overwriting pressure appears in stacked metaphors during setup: "seep into Echo Gorge, a pale gold mist curling through the jagged teeth of the cliffs like a held breath" layers three vehicles in rapid succession without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions: "not as X, but as Y" recurs three times in opening paragraphs. The phrase "luminous and gentle, the kind of ache that didn't hurt but reminded" in the penultimate paragraph approaches purple territory, telling the effect rather than trusting image. Paraphrase loop: "some souls didn't need release / They needed integration" is immediately restated as "the stitching of joy back into the fabric of their endings." Apply −0.6 for density and template issues, and −0.3 for the loop, totaling −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("anesthesia wore off in jagged waves," "forest's pulse," "mathematics of mercy") and occasionally muddles ("not a solution, but a silence—a gap where the numbers refused to meet" stacks abstractions). Template cadence appears in the middle section: "Not in sound, but in pressure" / "Not for surviving, but for understanding" / "not as memory but as weight." Paraphrase loop: "The math wasn't in the mercy. / The mercy was in the asking" restates the setup without added pressure. Information density is high and most lines advance, but the stacked metaphors in peak beats (pillars singing, skin peeling, equation unfolding) blur concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm modulates purposefully: short beats ("Lior did." "She followed.") punctuate longer lyric passages. Information density is high in the painter's booth exchange (lens fragment, miniature painting, Elara's name, log entry) but thins in the final third where conceptual restatements loop ("anchors weren't for staying... for returning," "best translations were the ones that changed you"). Template cadence appears in the closing paragraphs: "She was no longer just X. She was Y." and "The past wasn't X. It was Y" repeat the negation-then-assertion structure three times within ~150 words (−0.5 in Q7 per patterned-artifact penalty pack). Figurative language is dense ("lens catching light like a trapped storm," "ropes singing a harmony," "shadows that moved like memories") and occasionally mixed (light "trapped" vs. "flared anew" within two beats), but remains legible. No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift; grammar and tense are clean. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final star image attempts resonance but follows thematic summary rather than charging it.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Strong specificity in "the dust smooth, undisturbed" versus "particles sharp-edged, restless." However, multiple figurative constructions cluster without pattern-teaching: "dead for thirty years," "ghost of laughter clinging," "edges blurred like smudged chalk," "pulsed faintly, like a slow breath" all within the opening third creates mild density drag (−0.3). The line "Dust was a language" is a micro tell-statement that could be cut (the next paragraph shows it). Template cadence appears in "Not the groan... but a *click*" and "Not from decay... They were seams"—both effective as emphasis but the repetition of the negation-structure across key beats becomes slightly algorithmic (−0.2). The closing sentence stacks three parallel phrases that feel summative rather than propulsive. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.4)
    High figurative density in many sentences without pattern-teaching ("frost on the windows formed patterns no blade of grass should ever mimic: jagged, pulsing, like veins beneath translucent skin") muddies immediacy (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "wasn't just printing words—he was compressing eternity" restates the motivation without added detail (−0.2). Template cadence in the final third: "The library began to dissolve...The sea of clouds swallowed him...The clouds below began to stir" repeats "The [noun] [verb]" openings across adjacent beats (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("books unraveling into silk threads") and elevated diction ("eternity," "starlight") pervade the closure, reducing specificity. Total artifact debt exceeds −1.2; applies only in Q7 per routing rules.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and often dense with information, but overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: "the air above it rippling like heat off desert stone" and "the time-strands around them *twisted*, knitting the cathedral's ruins back into wholeness for the space of three breaths" stack metaphors without clarity gain. The italicized emphasis on *refracted*, *twisted*, *worshipped*, and *remembered* becomes a tic. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but scaffold sentences like "The storm outside the cathedral's cracked dome was a rare one, its winds carrying charged particles that made the time-strands glow like embers" delay momentum. The opening and closing images are strong, but mid-story density occasionally obscures propulsion. Filter verbs ("believed," "saw," "felt") are used sparingly and do not cluster, so no additional penalty applies. Sentence openings vary, but the elevated register never breathes, creating a uniform texture that dulls peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "hummed like a held breath," "wilts near dishonesty," "harmonic tug like a fishhook in the ribs," "dawn, raw and bleeding," "swallowed needles." In the climactic paragraph ("The chamber's balance tipped..."), nearly every line carries metaphor without rest, risking overwriting. Two paraphrase loops: "The stone wasn't meant to be free" / "Now, tethered...it was hungry" restates captivity; "Not a tune, but a pull" / "a harmonic tug" cycles the same image. Template cadence in the final third: "Then it took... Then the rust." Minor clarity slip: "unwind something older" and "give it back...the lie" require inference. No scaffold or generation artifacts. Information density is strong when not stacked.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character (psychometry backstory), setting (lagoon minerals), or pressure (compass needle spinning). Rhythm varies purposefully; short declaratives ("Not a door. A threshold.") punctuate longer descriptive sentences. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor texture issue: "the place where explanations failed, where every question only birthed another" and later "the shape of its absence, the quiet where understanding ended and something else began" echo each other thematically within the final third, approaching conceptual redundancy but not crossing into true loop. Figurative language (reverse waterfall, empty eyes) is coherent and tied to the hinge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid ("blue dot winking out like a dying star," "golden stitches"). Information density is high in the archway sequence. However, line-level issues accumulate: "He pressed his palm" / "He pressed the lantern" / "He pressed the finished piece" recycles the same verb stem across key beats, creating template cadence. "The storm roared approval" and "the archway groaned as if in answer" personify without earned pressure. Filter verbs ("he wondered," "Elias saw," "Elias understood") stack in the middle third, dulling immediacy. The final third recovers momentum, but the mid-section loops ("Their motives weren't his, but their *need* was") without advancing pressure. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lyric and controlled in rhythm, with vivid images ("light bleeding through the paper like a wound") and purposeful compression. Sentence variety is strong in the first two-thirds. However, the final third contains paraphrase loops and template cadence: multiple short declarative sentences with parallel structure ("The postcards would stay. The murals would fade. But the hush would remain...") that restate the closure rather than advancing it. The figurative language is dense throughout without always adding pressure; some metaphors are stock ("like fallen leaves," "a ghost against the dark"). Apply −0.6 for template cadence in the closure beats and −0.3 for paraphrase loops, totaling −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies well across beats; sensory specificity (brass hull, salt-stung air, ozone) is concrete. Information density is high in the opening third. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "wasn't just reading—he was *there*" followed immediately by "trapped in the echo of her memories" restates immersion without new pressure. The phrase "retroactive fever dream" and "echo of her memories" blur into synonym churn. The closure paragraph stacks filter verbs and summary ("felt like a current," "weight…lifted") where a single charged image would sharpen impact. Template cadence in mid-story beats (He descended… He knelt… He saw…) slightly dulls momentum. No artifacts touch the final image directly, but cumulative patterns lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats (bottle warming, scent returning). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Not as it was, but as it *could be*" followed immediately by "not as it had died, but as it might live again" restates the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening: "The alchemist had outlived... Paper-Lantern Cove had been... Now, the only light..." cycles identical stems across three lines (−0.4). Figurative language ("memory as crucible," "ghosts with weight") is concentrated but coherent. One stock phrase: "stubborn *there*-ness" reads as faux-profound abstraction. Aggregate penalty −0.6 in Q7; no closure-beat harm, so non-closure cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: "thin as a whisper, brittle as old bone," "the ink smudged like a child's forgotten sigh." Rhythm varies (short climactic sentence "The water darkened" followed by longer expansions). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs are present. However, the piece carries some overwriting in non-peak beats: "the scent of blossoms and the distant hum of subway tunnels" is serviceable but slightly generic, and "the way a dying man's breath hitched on the syllable of a name" in paragraph two leans toward figurative stacking without strict necessity. The closure beat is clean. Applying the artifact guidance (density without pattern-teaching in some descriptive runs, −0.4 to −0.6 in Q7) and the non-closure cap, the score lands in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative density that mostly serves atmosphere: "breath curling like smoke," "ice shattered upward in jagged teeth," "roots erupting...threading into its feathers." One paraphrase loop: "The atrium trembled. Starlight bent" followed immediately by "The vortex's pull reversed" feels like restatement of the same beat. Minor template cadence in the opening: "The last egg had hatched...its shell a brittle crescent moon" uses a stock poetic construction. The climax beats are propulsive and clear. The phrase "what hatched from the atrium's eggs was never quite yours, only borrowed, like time itself" frontloads the theme in a way that reduces discovery at the end. Overall information density is high with momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create propulsion. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Clarity is strong throughout the test-and-fix sequence. Figurative language is purposeful but dense in places: "solstice hush draped like a shroud," "blade through mist," "thread of warning stitching through the storm's roar." The phrase "its frayed core bound tight with whale-sinew and beeswax" front-loads detail that later matters, demonstrating economy. Minor: a few constructions edge toward elevated register ("marrow of him," "abyss"), but they remain voice-coherent. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "whispered secrets," "ghostly heat," "cradle of unseen growth," "veins of starlight" appear in most paragraphs without variation in register or rhythm. Paraphrase loops are visible: "he finally understood" / "because he finally understood"; "flourishing stillness" / "hush of the era"; multiple sentences begin with "The" + noun constructs. Template cadence: "He [verb]" openers recur (He traced, He followed, He closed, He laughed, He smiled, He walked). Clarity remains high, but information density suffers from synonym churn ("overlooked," "forgotten," "abandoned") and scaffolding transitions ("Then came," "The next morning," "Somewhere"). The final third accumulates thematic restatements that slow closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; images like "ribs of buried giants" and "held breath shapes a room" are vivid. Information density is high in most beats. However, template cadence appears: "The beekeeper [verb]. He [verb]. He [verb]" runs across multiple paragraphs, and paraphrase loops surface ("The box stayed. The covenant did not"—restates prior content without added pressure). Figurative density in the coda (wind as grieving thing, then breath; quiet that "held space") approaches saturation without full pattern-teaching. Apply template-cadence and loop penalties: −0.8 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "fossilized spring," "overripe fruit," "honey then smoke." Mixed-metaphor risk: "forgotten needle in the earth" with "emerald patina" feels strained. Template cadence in the object-list paragraphs ("a child's mittens," "a vinyl record," "a pocket mirror") flattens momentum. Paraphrase loop: "The silo wasn't a tomb. It was a loom" immediately follows the garage-sale metaphor without added pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully elsewhere, and information density is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "breath between," "oil on water," "bruise healing," "torn curtain," "half-drowned" words. Two friction points: "weaving dawns" (metaphor vehicle unclear—dawns aren't woven) and mild template cadence in "He was weaving... He pressed... He wrote..." stems. Information density is strong; most lines advance image and philosophy together. Paraphrase check: "imperfect" and "incomplete" recur across paragraphs but with evolving context. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality. Propulsion slows slightly in the middle third with reflective asides (teacup, hinge, lullaby) but recovers at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies well ("The stone pillars breathed" opens strong; "That was the point" closes with economy). Information density is high: "copper wire spiraled around boughs, notes on how the metal oxidized just enough to feed the trees" does triple work (object, method, world logic). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor figurative density in the opening paragraph—"breath to something thin, like wind through dead leaves," "joints to brittle hinges"—risks overwriting but stays legible and character-specific. The final image ("The pillars sighed, welcoming another pair of hands") charges without clutter. One template stem: "It was just Elira, stubborn to the last, remodeling the world into something kinder" borders on summary-tell but serves the ending's quiet turn.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is sharp ("stone skin slick with memory," "edges blurring like heat haze"). Information density is high. However, some lines loop conceptually: "The signal wasn't a call. It was a *key*" followed immediately by "The tower wasn't built to send messages. It was built to *receive* pilgrims" uses parallel negation-then-correction twice in quick succession, creating template cadence. "The academics called it coincidence. Elara called it an invitation" is clean antithesis, but the pattern recurs. Minor filter-verb stack in the middle third ("The amber fly warmed," "The terminal chimed," "A hologram unfurled") slightly dulls immediacy during a high-pressure beat. No major loops, but the figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and image-rich, with strong figurative language ("the jetty stretched like a broken rib," "syllables curling from his throat like smoke"). However, several metaphors border on mixed or strained: "the land was hungry... for the stubborn green fingers of things that grew" anthropomorphizes soil while mechanically explaining the metaphor. Paraphrase loops appear: "He did not pray—prayers were for those who still believed in mercy—but he whispered the old words anyway" and "The work was not in the seeing, but in the trusting" repeat the not-X-but-Y construction within close proximity. The final section summarizes years in quick succession, flattening momentum and reducing information density at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Strong imagery ("glass dome, half-buried, its surface etched," "vines curled tight around bones") propels momentum. Paraphrase loop detected: "Distance is a wound" / "The distance had become a wound" and "The wound, a bridge" recur without added pressure—apply −0.2. Template cadence in short declaratives near closure ("The dome hummed. / The vines tightened. / The world outside was a scar.") reads as intentional patterning but flattens propulsion slightly. Stock metaphors ("wild hush," "cracked wasteland," "bleeding into") appear frequently without transformation. No causality breaks; artifacts remain in mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (stars "unwinding into threads," light "like a bloom in reverse") enriches without overwhelming. However, several scaffold patterns accumulate: "She [verb]" openers cluster in the middle third, and near-paraphrase loops appear ("the silence so deep it echoed" / "echoed silence swallowed her"). The phrase "not burning, but revealing" and similar corrective constructions recur enough to become template-like. Information density is high in peak beats (compass needle snapping, sketch alignment), but the final paragraph's stacked abstractions ("fold between then and now," "shape of the custom") dilute propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language supports tone, but density issues emerge: "The spire groaned, the wrong sky outside twisting like a wound" and "the clouds churned like a restless sea" repeat atmospheric gestures without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops appear in the descent: "She walked, each step lighter" followed by "The descent was easier now, the ice shaping itself" restates ease. Stock constructions—"slithered from the dark," "heavy with the weight of a confession"—cluster in high-pressure beats. No grammar errors; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The violet-sun-as-heartbeat and spire-singing final images redeem earlier slack, but mid-story scaffold and synonym churn (stillness/precision, trembling/hitching) lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence ("nomadic penumbra," "cathedral of forgotten kings," "wings... fragile as moths"), creating texture but occasionally obscuring clarity in peak beats (e.g., "its absence luminous as a wound"). Multiple paraphrase loops: "They didn't surrender... They ascended" is restated as "the pawns hadn't been taken... had unbound themselves" without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third: "The penumbra drifted... The interregnum ended... And Liora? She walked." Heavy filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she told it," "she pressed") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Apply −1.0 for patterned artifacts (loops, template stems, filter stacks) and −0.3 for elevated diction drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but largely coherent (mountain as throat/book, stone as heart/mirror). Minor overwriting in peak beats: "the ink was the color of mercury, the color of storms, the color of a talent finally unearthed" stacks three synonymous clauses without added pressure. Template cadence in the memory sequence: "At eight… At fifteen… At twenty-seven…" reads mechanical. Paraphrase loop: "The stone wasn't a key. It was a mirror" followed immediately by extended explanation of what the mirror shows. No major clarity breaks, but density and scaffold drag slightly reduce propulsion in the final third. Information density is otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the labyrinth sequence deploys figurative language without pattern-teaching ("veins humming with the lull of distant thunder, a sound that wasn't sound at all"). Mixed metaphors: thunder as lull, silence as held breath, ice around his heart. Register drift: "the fierce repose of a board reset" and "the quiet alchemy of forgiveness" clash with chess-tutor idiom. Paraphrase loops: the tapestry's frayed threads are described, then re-described as "lies from truth," then "confession stitched in silver." Template cadence: "The tutor knelt... The metal warmed... With a breath, he wove..." Apply −1.2 for density, coherence, and register drift across the closure third; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is dense: "jagged rib," "slick with the condensation of a thousand held breaths," "bleeding fingers." Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, several figurative phrases cluster without clear propulsion: "needle drawing thread from the sky," "salt in the endless echoes," "arrows" for echoes feel ornamental. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "She knew... She didn't watch... she descended... she picked up... she would carve..." (five consecutive "she [verb]" stems). This stack triggers −0.5 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally. Minor paraphrase loop: "bone-dust settling" echoes "dust of old carvings" and "chalked with dust" without added meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("acid sea gnawed," "scar split the stone like a scream frozen mid-birth"). Information density is high and the prose propels toward closure. However, the piece shows signs of overwriting in high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("face half-drowned in doubt, half-lit by the desperate glow") and elevated diction ("threading through the gaps like a needle pulling time itself taut") occasionally obscure rather than clarify. The final third accumulates template-like constructions ("The statue's mouth split open," "The workshop lurched," "The alchemist was already elsewhere") that slightly dull propulsion. No paraphrase loops but the density of figurative language in most sentences of the climax triggers a −0.5 deduction for coherence and register drift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "tide had swallowed," "time curled in on itself," "breathe" applied to caves, "shell's colors bled," "cave sighed." In the cave sequence, metaphors stack without respite—"jagged shadows like broken teeth," "heartbeat" moss, "shell's hidden chamber"—creating textural richness but also occasional muddle (the cave both breathes and sighs; the pool both "didn't resist" and "revealed"). Template cadence appears in the final third: "He didn't wash them. Instead, he walked..." and "The villagers would call it suicide. But Elias knew better." These constructions dull momentum. Information density is strong early (mirror, cliffs, ochre, docks) but the ending sequence includes scaffold ("Then the cave exhaled, and the world outside carried on, none the wiser"). The artifacts touch the closure zone, triggering cumulative penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density and varied rhythm; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor overwriting in several beats: "deliberate as a held breath," "tender, screaming only in its precision," "thick and sweet, though the lighthouse garden had been dead for decades" stack figurative language without clear payoff in a single passage. One paraphrase loop: "the scent of crushed lavender and damp earth—the garden's memory" restates without added pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and controlled with strong concrete detail ("rusted antennae," "warped floorboards," "greenish bloom of oxidation"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "She hadn't always been a navigator of ruins" anchors past and present). However, minor scaffold appears: "the censer foot didn't glow, didn't sing—but it listened" leans toward stock mysticism, and "raw and unpolished" in the penultimate paragraph adds a label where image already carries the weight. "The weight in her chest felt lighter, as if the maps weren't just directions, but anchors" unpacks the metaphor slightly more than needed. Information density is high elsewhere, and the final lines propel cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("orchard hung like a broken chandelier," "revelation was a blade"). Minor overwriting: "something older" and "something like grief" are vague placeholders in otherwise specific beats. The truffle-smearing sequence is propulsive and clear. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected. One slight register slip: "cognitive smoothness" is not Lior's lexicon, but "pattern recognition was survival now" functions.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often lyric and purposeful: "stretched into the mist like a half-remembered dream," "soft but persistent, like the pulse of the beacon." Information density is high and momentum steady. However, several craft issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the way the stranger's pupils had dilated… as if the memory belonged to someone else" / "The memories weren't his. They were echoes"), template cadence in reflection blocks ("the way X, the way Y, the way Z" repeated across two paragraphs), and figurative density in non-peak beats ("vein of forgotten bone," "threaded with a hundred borrowed goodbyes") that risks overwriting. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping penalty per the non-closure rule.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies cleanly, and information density is high in the opening third. Figurative language is controlled: "foxfire trapped in metal," "roots parting like fingers unclenching." However, a paraphrase loop appears mid-story—"the chip *knew*" followed by three sequential demonstrations (tugged, warmed, flared) that restate rather than advance. The penultimate paragraph employs template cadence: "walked until… until… until" in three parallel clauses, dulling momentum at a pivotal beat. The wet-ink map is vivid but arrives as symbolic convenience rather than causal payoff. No major grammatical errors, but the closure beat loses propulsion to ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Minor paraphrase loop: "The grotto had not lied. / It had not taken. / It had *remembered*" restates the same conceptual beat without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density is high throughout ("wound," "blade," "honey," "needles," "stitching...to the sky") and mostly coherent, but the stacked metaphors in the transformation paragraph ("needles," "fire," "constellation," "silver wings," "lullaby") approach density overload without full payoff in the next beat. Information density is strong; most lines advance image or stakes. Clarity remains high despite lush diction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density pervades most sentences in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "its juice the density of all the things they'd ever meant to say," "a frequency only they could hear," "the space between their ribs." Paraphrase loops appear ("It wasn't about capturing density anymore. It was about becoming the weight" immediately after "not as a tool, but as a promise"). Template cadence runs: "The shell had done its work. Now it was theirs to do the rest. They walked, not toward the next experiment, but inside it." Stock metaphors ("like veins of molten copper," "like a current") and elevated diction ("scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity") in peak beats reduce immediacy. Overwriting touches the closure beat ("their footsteps revaluing the streets"), triggering the higher artifact penalty range and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and most sentences advance multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the scroll's nature is restated across multiple paragraphs (ink shimmer, revision weight, glyph transformations), and the "time as wound" concept is repeated without added pressure. Template cadence in the countdown section ("Three. / Two. / One.") is purposeful but the "(Or never here. / Or both.)" pattern recurs mechanically. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching, occasionally obscuring causality (how exactly do glyphs rearrange themselves?). Information density is strong, but loop check fails in the scroll-description cluster.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the screw-interpretation beat. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Some things couldn't be fixed. / Only witnessed. / Only passed on" restates the same idea three times without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the closing section ("The clock dripped. / The morning waited. / And Elias...") across multiple short declaratives reads mechanical rather than voice-motivated (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: "breath on glass" (fog) then "ghosts" (scent) then "liquid time" cycles through vehicles without coherent tenor. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so core penalty remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high ("She pressed the quill's tip to her pulse, not to draw blood, but to remember the superstition her grandmother had whispered"). The figurative language is mostly vivid and coherent. However, several beats suffer from template cadence: "She understood then: the shedding wasn't loss, but refinement" echoes "She had spent years fearing the space between storms" and "Now she understood it was the only time anything could change"—runs of realization-stems that dull the accumulation. The final third stacks poetic parallelisms ("Somewhere, her grandmother was smiling. / Somewhere, the storm was learning her language. / And somewhere, a child was tracing...") that risk synonym churn of the closure image. The quill "shed its tip into her palm, a deliberate surrender" is strong, but the subsequent rephrasing in adjacent lines slightly loops the concept without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is specific ("liquid twilight," "sharp, green tang of sap," "deflating bellows"). Information density is high in the perfume-use beat: each line advances both metaphor and physical action. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected in peak beats. Minor issues: The opening's "yellowed paper and old roses" is evocative but slightly stock; the phrase "thicker than perfume, something that shimmered" uses a weak "something" construction. The final paragraphs shift into summary-explanatory mode with multiple exposition sentences ("Later, when the city asked…" / "She never told them…" / "Elias called it…"), introducing scaffold that dilutes the closure image's immediacy. These artifacts don't obscure causality but do reduce propulsion in the final third, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing images are strong. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the temple shuddered" followed by redundant book-tumbling description, and multiple restatements of the weight/lightness motif without added detail. Template cadence surfaces in the closing beats ("He did not open it. Some illusions... The wind carried... He closed his eyes. The universe breathed.") with repetitive "He [verb]" stems across four consecutive sentences. Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching or escalation; metaphors occasionally conflict (the library "breathing" with a "dying heart" versus later "holding its breath"). Information density is high in early paragraphs but drops in the final third as summary takes over.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The counting sequences accelerate tension effectively. Minor figurative clustering in the opening (barnacle, jagged smile, wind gardener) stays legible and voice-driven. The prose is clean, with strong verbs ("vomiting black water") and specific nouns. The final line "Tomorrow, he'd count backwards from ninety-eight" lands with propulsion and recharges the counting motif without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the traversal sequence where fragments accelerate. The opening simile ("like someone had left a book out in the storm") is fresh and apt. However, two paraphrase loops appear: the "her father would call it" construction recurs three times with minimal variation, and "the lantern" opens consecutive sentences in the final third. The metaphor mixing around contradictions as "seams" versus "frayed" logic versus "tear" lacks full coherence. Figurative density is high but mostly lands; the clover scent/tone thread unifies without forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high in the opening and closing paragraphs. However, the middle third carries reflective summary loops: the two-paragraph block beginning "The wrong numbers found him" and "Tonight's caller was different" recounts backstory (man who called for a decade, woman who dialed childhood home) without present micro-choices that alter tactics—this flattens momentum per BRR, though it primes thematic resonance. Template cadence appears in "About the man who called... About the woman who'd dialed..." (parallel stems). One metaphor ("liquid constellation") works; "melodically haunted" (laugh) is apt. No major clarity breaks, but the loops and scaffold in the reflective passage cap the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (water "the color of old parchment," stars as "holes in the sky") charges atmosphere. Three distinct frictions: (1) Paraphrase loop—"The archivist walked… carrying the weight of small moments" restates her role without new pressure; (2) "steeped" recurs three times across the piece, becoming template cadence; (3) Final-third figurative density ("like a relic, like a weapon, like a gift") stacks modifiers without advancing the beat. Deductions: −0.6 for template cadence and loops, −0.3 for stacked modifiers near closure. Total: −0.9.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (moon rock is gift/bribe/mistake in one line). Figurative language is strong ("ivy swallowing its own echoes," "kudzu-buried freight car") without overwriting. Two patterns lower the score: paraphrase loops ("By noon...By dusk" template cadence; "Maybe that was the cure. Maybe it was just the motion" restates without added pressure) and one stock phrase ("desperate jocularity of someone who'd long since accepted") that tells rather than embodying the trait. These artifacts don't obscure closure but dull mid-story momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm is controlled and varied, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "uncharted depths," "quiet blaze," "shimmering chord," "languages seep from his skin like mist." Several metaphors collide or remain abstract ("the spaces between sound and meaning, between loss and the quiet fire that followed"). Paraphrase loops appear: "The stillpoint had given him what he sought: not a destination, but the courage to navigate the depths" is restated two paragraphs later as "the stillpoint had never been the end. It was the pause before the next note." Template cadence in the final section: "He didn't look back. The map was in his bones now... He didn't need to listen..." Stock metaphor strings ("mist," "dawn," "light") accumulate without fresh inflection. Information density is moderate; many sentences serve atmosphere more than advancement. Apply artifact penalty: −0.8 for pervasive figurative muddle and paraphrase loops across high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("unbending moments, unfolding them like crumpled paper"), but several metaphors compete without coherence: ink becomes breath, memory, and roots within a few paragraphs. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" constructions and paired participial openers ("listening to," "tucking the vellum"). Paraphrase loops: "It didn't erase. It layered" and "less like a correction and more like a conversation" restate the same insight. The final third layers metaphor (roots, heartbeat, stirring seeds) without advancing pressure, slowing momentum. Clarity remains high, but information density drops as symbolic recurrence substitutes for on-page consequence. Minor positives: strong opening line, varied paragraph rhythm, and the "dipped the pen into the well of his own breath" image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "thread of smoke," "ghost of a flash," "blade wrapped in velvet," "storm," "breaking glass and wind chimes" in quick succession without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Paraphrase loops appear: "the harbor seemed to breathe with them" and "the harbor sighed" restate without added pressure. Template cadence in the climax ("The harbor answered. / Waves rose… / The faceless thing wailed…") flattens propulsion. "Sign language" and "mapping silence" are told concepts without shown mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled. However, paraphrase loops appear: "he'd burned the libraries to rescue the promise" is restated multiple times across paragraphs. Template cadence in the final third: "The sun rose... Somewhere, a new library... Elias smiled... Then he vanished... The wind erased..." creates a drumbeat. Stock metaphor "sharp and fleeting, like the strike of a match" and "volcanic tenderness" (repeated from prompt) reduce freshness. Information density is high but loops and cadence stiffness lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "stolen constellations," "vault of auroral sorrow," "gasping fish," "vines," "shattered glass." While the pattern is taught early, the accumulation in peak beats (memory-release sequence) risks overwriting without always advancing pressure—"red" sob, "gold and violet" depths, "infinite hush" stack metaphor without clear propulsion. Sentence openings vary, but several lines paraphrase adjacently: "The treatment was supposed to heal. / Instead, it made her a vault" and "The doctors would call this a relapse. / She called it a birth" repeat the contrast structure. Rhythm modulates well, and no major loops or scaffolding mar clarity. Information density is good, though some lines ("The universe held its breath") tilt decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("dockworker's rolling limp (old injury, left knee)" packs observation, inference, and specificity). Paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph: "quiet endured" / "whispers…lingered" / "footsteps would…always" restates the same thesis without added pressure. The final "outside, the containers creaked" beat reads as atmospheric scaffold rather than causal closure. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "metal sighed, peeling back like a curtain" works, though "invitation" in the next line abstracts it.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively: short beats ("She didn't turn. Instead, she began to weave.") alternate with layered descriptors. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (setting, action, emotion). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "canal's breath fogged the air," "shadows pooled between the boats like forgotten promises." Two slips lower the score: (1) "The cobalt dock glistened under a sky still heavy with unshed rain, the wooden planks slick as the canal's breath fogged the air" stacks modifiers and slightly muddles the sequence; (2) minor paraphrase loop between "The guardian knew this because she had seen..." and the prior description of the boy's trembling. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. The epilogue section introduces mild scaffold ("The next morning... By evening...") but remains functional.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images ("cobalt library stood like a bruise," "filings dance and align"). Information density is high and momentum steady through the escalation. However, several loops and near-duplicates appear: "unspoken words" recurs three times without reweighting; "the game was far from over" echoes "the game isn't over" within two paragraphs; "mist" and "cobalt" are recycled decoratively. Template cadence: "He [verb], then [verb]" structures repeat ("He nodded, then gathered"). Stock metaphors: "like a bruise," "like a held breath," "like question marks." These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull the closure beats slightly. Apply −0.8 for moderate loop/scaffold spread, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats, total −1.1 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several loops and scaffolds appear: "the salt-stiffened ropes biting into his palms like old grudges" / "sharp as the wind off the sublittoral fringe" stack metaphors without adding pressure; "deeper than the docks' groaning planks, deeper than his own breath" is a paraphrase loop. "He didn't become anything. / He'd only remembered." restates the same idea across two beats. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to say," "seemed to murmur") in the whale's dialogue dull immediacy. The closing metaphor "his heart—once guarded as the pirate's treasure—now open as the sky after a storm" is vivid but arrives after closure and feels ornamental. Information density is high, but template cadence and synonym churn in the final third lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("She didn't cry") anchor beats, longer lyric sentences ("a thing you carried…") exhale reflection. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high—each image (turbines, bouquet, tin, knife) does double work (setting and symbol, action and theme). Minor filter-verb presence ("seemed to exhale") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. Opening line ("slow, indifferent gods") and closing image ("a choice not absence, a remaking") frame the arc cleanly. One small slip: "something like peace… something like fear, something like hope" repeats the "something like" stem within three lines, a minor scaffold moment that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high—"breath held too long," "cloud-shadow poet," "ink in water," "lantern-moth hush"—and mostly coherent, but clusters of metaphor in adjacent lines ("dissolved like ink," "edges dissolving," "fluid and flickering") create minor muddle in the middle third. Several paraphrase loops appear: "the hum seep into her bones" / "synchronized with the pulse of the quartz" restate dissolution without added pressure. Template cadence is controlled, and the final image lands cleanly. Sentence rhythm varies, but the density of lyric devices occasionally slows momentum rather than propelling it. No major artifacts touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies (−0.8 for density and loop issues).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lyric and image-rich with strong opening and closing lines. Rhythm varies and sensory detail is specific. However, pervasive pattern issues harm momentum: paraphrase loops ("He didn't need to see" appears twice in final third; "The courtyard was already blooming" echoes "courtyard had never been so alive"), filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he understood," "he'd spent"), and synonym churn around "imperfection/crack/broken." The closure image is charged, but the approach is cluttered with scaffold. Apply −1.0 for accumulated line-level artifacts spanning multiple beats, including the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and vivid imagery. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the texture of connection" is restated three times without added pressure; "space between" recurs in adjacent beats; "powerfully gentle" and "the act of walking" are concept-labeled rather than shown. Template cadence runs in the bell-creation sequence ("She struck it once. The sound didn't travel. It *unfolded*"). Filter-verb stack in early paragraphs ("she murmured," "pressed," "adjusted") dulls immediacy. Golden-shadow motif is vivid but deployed mechanically. Cumulative loop and scaffold penalties apply: −0.6 baseline for paraphrase and stem repetition across key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective ("copper so thin they trembled like real ones"). However, a paraphrase loop appears in the grief-realization passage: "Grief, she realized, was not a thing to be buried in metal. It was a stencil, a coordinate, a folded promise. And like the artificial flower, it could be shaped to hold the light." The second and third sentences restate the first without added pressure (−0.2 for paraphrase loop). Template cadence in the crane-placement sequence ("The first on the observatory steps... The second, she placed... The third, she wedged...") spans three sentences but serves a deliberate cataloging effect, so no deduction. Information density is high until the winter coda, which summarizes rather than dramatizes. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character method, or thematic pattern. However, several beats loop conceptually: "Numbers, he'd found, were just another kind of symbol" echoes the tarot-as-measurement conceit established earlier, and the closing paragraphs recycle phrasing ("The work was never about predicting the future. It was about reverse engineering the present") without new pressure. The metaphor of raindrops as lenses and the skylight as a pattern-reading device is vivid but risks overwriting in the middle section. No grammar errors; sentence openings vary. Propulsion slows slightly in the final third due to paraphrase loops and recapitulated theme statements.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed success: "air dissolving into atoms of nostalgia" and "dust rained... each particle a fragment of a life" layer images without clear propulsion. Several lines restate the same insight ("to know is to resist repetition" / "they had sought answers, but she sought only the silence between them"), creating paraphrase loops. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She recoiled, then steadied herself. Fear was just another pattern.") The closure beat ("The pagoda crumbled... not into ruins, but into light") is abstract rather than concrete, dulling immediate impact. Sentence openings vary well, but information density sags under metaphor weight in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high ("blooming library," "shadows bleeding at the edges," "library sighed, its shelves shifting") and mostly coherent, though "bloomed under her fingers, petals of light unfolding" stacks visual metaphors in a way that slightly blurs sense. Some paraphrase appears: "Some hopes were too heavy to carry alone" and "Some stories don't need words" function as thematic restates. The phrase "softly deliberate" recurs three times, twice in identical construction, creating minor template cadence. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the closing ("The library hummed back") lands cleanly. Information density is generally high, though a few scaffold beats ("She understood now why the curator had lied. / He'd been trying to protect her.") could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("pearl of new growth glistening...translucent as dawn on spider silk"). Information density is high, though a paraphrase loop appears: "He could reconstruct it" followed by the three-layer explanation restates the same idea across multiple lines without added pressure. Minor template cadence in the ritual beats ("He began...," "The second layer...," "Back in the workshop...") slightly flattens momentum. No major artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain modest. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally dense without pattern-teaching (mist metaphor recurs without evolving function).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: "coffee rings...concentric confessions, brown halos" does triple work (image, metaphor, character habit). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; however, "the stone was tunneling—no, *being* tunneled through...by something that moved by examining the rings of things" risks mixed metaphor (tunneling agent examines rings?) and momentarily obscures causality. Minor overwriting in "tendrils tightening around the stone's old wounds" (wounds metaphor stacks with ivy's literal grip). The final image is charged and specific. Clarity holds at closure; propulsion is steady despite reflective density.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is vivid but overwritten in stretches: "thief of echoes," "spatially imaginative by necessity," "hushed thunder" all front-load figurative density without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear ("the letters weren't in envelopes. / They were here, in the flicker and the grain" followed by "not as ink, but as absence"), and the mid-section recycles "stored" across multiple lines without causal pressure. Read-aloud rhythm is strong in the final third, but the opening and middle carry scaffolding that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "time didn't bend—it *unraveled*," "creativity she'd trapped in her ribs like a caged bird," "liquid darkness," "waves of ink and ember," "a city of light," "stardust in her veins." In the climax, metaphors stack without clarifying mechanics: the instrument "drank the light," needles "stitched the sky's whispers into something tangible," and creativity "surged outward—through her, into the night." Mixed vehicle: equations "hung there, glowing" while dates "bloomed like flowers in fast-forward." Paraphrase loop: "The whispers were louder, urgent" / "The whispers grew clearer now" / "The whispers were gone." Template cadence in the resolution: "Her paintings sold for fortunes. / Her music made strangers weep. / And sometimes…" Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs, but peak beats rely on declaration ("she *saw*," "she understood") rather than concrete action. The opening and closing images (archway, canvas, falling stars) provide purposeful bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in the opening and closure beats. However, patterned artifacts appear: italicized phrases (*glowing dunes in bloom*, *occasionally everywhere*, *charming*, *through wave functions*, *divergent archive*, *fractured lullaby*) function as decorative tags rather than earned images, reading like prompt-element insertions that dilute momentum. Template stems recur ("The clock…," "The spark…," "The train…") across multiple beats without variation. Figurative language in most lines of high-pressure beats (clock chime as vibration rewriting air, dunes as petals, train whistle as fractured lullaby) adds texture but occasionally muddies clarity. No paraphrase loops, but the italicized elements and stem repetition trigger line-level penalties. Deduction: −1.0 for patterned artifacts (italicized tags, template cadence) spread across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies; many lines do double duty (sensory + conceptual). However, figurative density is high throughout without teaching a strict pattern: "tuning fork pressed to the ribs of the world," "branches tracing equations," "compass made of smoke." Some vehicles are vivid, others blur ("probable miracles" remains abstract). Template cadence appears in the closing run: "Only gears. Only hums. Only the quiet..." (−0.3). Paraphrase loops: "the frontier wasn't out there—it was..." then "He stood, and the forest stood with him..." restate the same realization (−0.2). No major causality break, but density without payoff and minor scaffold lower momentum. Apply −0.5 cumulative in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third. Clear propulsion through the middle with purposeful sentence variation. Major deductions: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("She had left every time she'd turned her boat toward the far shore, every time she'd punched a ticket and sent someone onward" restates the same content without added pressure). Template cadence in the final paragraph: "The fire crackled. The water sighed. Liora closed her eyes..." stacks short declaratives in a way that feels mechanical. Stock metaphors cluster in the ending ("held note," "quiet certainty," "let the twilight hold her"), dulling the closure image. These artifacts touch the final third, triggering the disallowance of 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty (the bolt's warmth signals agency; snow as "notes on a broken scale"). Clarity is mostly strong, but several beats suffer from overwriting: "seraphically mundane in its imperfection, like a saint's halo drawn by a child's hand" stacks metaphor without propulsion, and "tuneless, frostbitten hope of a sound" mixes vehicles. Template cadence appears in the final third: "He thought of... He thought of..." and "The pianist turned... The pianist's eyes... The pianist began..." across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "the cost of safety had never been silence. It had been the choice to stay silent" restates the same content. No major causality breaks, so penalties remain in Q7. Filter verbs ("felt the vibration," "thought of") cluster but do not dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense; the opening line ("The library had forgotten its own name") anchors voice and stakes immediately. Figurative language is purposeful: "edges frayed like the hem of a god's discarded robe," "moments bleed into one another like ink in rain." One template cadence run appears in the middle section: "He had known, of course. / The ink was her favorite... / Lirien, his oldest friend, who had sworn..." (three similar declarative stems). Minor paraphrase loop: "Veythas did not answer. / He knelt instead..." repeats the structure of deflection without adding new pressure. Zero loops or scaffold in the closure beats; the final paragraph propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high: most lines advance setting, motive, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates toward the ending ("The water was rising again now, swift and hungry, but the road didn't vanish"). Minor overwriting in "silent accusation" and "ghost of a shoreline" nudges toward the ornamental, and "sky remembered how to be blue" is slightly strained. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; the tapping rhythm motif recurs purposefully. Clarity and propulsion are strong through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the stone-circle sequence. Minor scaffold: "a vibration, not in the air, but in the soles of her feet" then "hum, deep and resonant" restates the same content; "the hum surged, climbing her arm, settling in her chest like a second heartbeat" uses template cadence (verb, gerund, gerund). Figurative density ("yawn in the margin," "awkward...like a bird with one wing askew," "thunderous serenity," "war drum made of stars") clusters without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting. These artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sensory density is high (steam, black sand, iridescent green). Opening and closing images resonate. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the plants had always spoken" / "the plants called it hungry" / "the plants called it overdue" / "the plants were already telling them" recycles the same claim across four beats without added pressure. "Tradition isn't a cage. It's a ladder" repeated verbatim at the ending as "*a ladder, not a loop*" is template cadence. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to scream," "called it") dull immediacy in key lines. Stock metaphor: "unfolding like a flower in fast-motion."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and controlled: "the wind off the cliffs carried salt and the ghost of foghorns," "the leaf's veins mirrored the cracks in the stone wall." Sentence variety supports rhythm; opening and closing beats breathe differently. Information density is high—most lines advance grief work, setting, or thematic charge. Two frictions: "the drone a speck in the sky no one had noticed yet" is clear but slightly expository for the photograph's caption-like moment, and the phrase "something heavier—something like roots" uses a hesitation pattern ("something... something") that feels writerly rather than Lena-voiced at a peak beat. The final paragraph's short declaratives (prune, leave, grow) land cleanly. No loops or scaffolding; clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative density saturates nearly every sentence in the second half without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "letting the dark shape what remained" / "a luminescent ache...the kind that lived in the bones" restate atmosphere without advancing causality. Template cadence is present ("She let...," "She smiled," "She reached out"), and the closure beat is metaphor-heavy without concrete action, applying the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively; the prose is mostly clean and propulsive. Information density is high in the opening (albino tracker, eclipse, drone, ink mechanism). Minor template cadence appears in the thief confrontation: "The man turned... The thief's smile faltered... The thief was gone." Two paraphrase loops: "time didn't slow... It fractured" is immediately restated as "time could break, it could be remade." Stock metaphor "carved rivers through stone" and "breath curling like smoke" in proximity reduce freshness. No major clarity issues; the closure beat remains unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high in the letter and climax beats. Two friction points lower the score: paraphrase loop ("The library kept breathing. / And for the first time in history, the archives spoke back" restates transformation without added pressure) and template cadence in the opening paragraphs ("The library had…," "Elara Vey…," "Her gloved fingers…," "The letter arrived…") creates a stacked declarative rhythm. Purple tendencies ("pulse scandalized," "barb," "dizzying quiet") cluster near peak beats without consistent pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Rhythm modulates well between kneeling stillness and the world's roar. Deductions: several paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear—"The tower was dust. The roses were not" echoes "The world had fallen" phrasing, and multiple sentences open with "She + verb" in the final third (−0.4). Stock metaphor "like a child's sandcastle under a boot" in the opening, and "thick with the scent of things that refused to break" leans abstract (−0.3). One filter-verb cluster mid-story ("felt the vibration," "smelled of earth") slightly dulls immediacy (−0.2). Artifacts do not obscure closure but accumulate across non-closure beats (total −0.9 per cap).

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance image, choice, or atmosphere. The paraphrase loop "The choice didn't matter. / What mattered was..." in the penultimate section is a visible scaffold; "He smiled. / It smiled back." reads as template closure cadence. Stock phrasing: "like a plucked string," "like wet silk," "smooth as river stones" are functional but unoriginal. No major causality breaks, and the closure beat remains clear. Overall line-level craft is strong with purposeful compression, but the accumulated minor artifacts and one explicit loop prevent entry into the 7.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies, information density is high, and the prose propels without loops. Minor issues: "The journalist had called an hour ago" and the orbit definition paragraph border on exposition that pauses momentum; "Regret was an orbit, she'd decided" is a statement rather than an image. The final third tightens well, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appear in the closure beat. Figurative language (orbit, comets) is controlled and purposeful, though the orbit metaphor is invoked frequently without evolving much until the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The firmware was haunted. It didn't just replay the past; it *tethered* to it" repeats the same idea; "The machine didn't silence guilt—it *fed* on it" is near-synonym churn of prior lines. Template cadence in opening: "She pressed… She'd found… She'd read…" runs three consecutive "She [past verb]" stems. Mixed metaphor: "pulling threads of guilt through the years like fishing line through water" (threads/fishing line vehicle clash). These artifacts lower the score but do not obscure closure. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for metaphor muddle = −0.9 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes. Some paraphrase loops appear: "The unlearning was over. / The remembering had just begun" restates conceptually what the prior beats dramatized, and "whimsy was just the face of a man who'd stopped fearing the lack of answers" tells rather than shows. Template cadence in the final third ("He knelt… He didn't speak… He slept… He packed…") stacks identical stems across five moves, applying −0.4 for runs. One mixed metaphor: "mist coiled… like a held breath" then "mist pooled thicker" shifts vehicle (breath to liquid) without acknowledgment. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and supports tone; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the naming beats. Two issues lower the score: (1) minor overwriting in the opening third—"shattered sky," "dying prayer," "skeletal minaret," "incense"—cluster figurative language without clear payoff until the ending; (2) a few paraphrase loops, e.g., "The mosaic was a map... He had learned" immediately followed by "His fingers found the pattern" restates the same knowledge. The final paragraph ("The work was only beginning") edges toward summary rather than image. No major artifacts touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (density in opening, minor loop) warrant −0.8, bringing a baseline ~8.0 down to 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with short bursts at peak moments and longer sentences during reflection. Information density is high in the opening ("seventy-three years...the stage still called her") but several paraphrase loops appear: "She'd worn that same expression once" echoes the prior recognition beat without advancing it, and "Some encores were quieter than others" restates the thematic claim. Template cadence appears in the closure sequence: "Some encores were... Some were just... Lydia smiled. The curtain would... And this time... She bowed anyway. The night swallowed..." The stacked short declaratives feel algorithmic and dull momentum. Figurative density ("orchard sighed—a sound that wasn't sound but the color of dusk dissolving") risks overwriting but remains legible. No grammar or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose carries strong sensory specificity and varied rhythm through most beats, but several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("colors have names now, and they're all wrong" / "colors that didn't exist yet"), template cadence in the final third ("She could follow. / Or she could *paint*. / Choosing, she reached"), and stock metaphoric phrasing ("thin as a whisper," "warm as a living thing"). The closure sequence compresses key transformations into summary ("By the time the painting was finished, the sliver had dissolved") rather than dramatizing the painting process beat-by-beat. Information density is high in the opening half but thins toward abstraction in the final movements.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor paraphrase loop: "The caves weren't just transitional. / They were waiting." restates without added pressure. The fossil's floating/levitating distinction is over-explained mid-scene. Figurative density in the climax ("topographic map of grief, of longing, of a planet holding its breath") stacks metaphors without clear vehicle logic. The closing image ("each drop hitting the sand with the weight of a promise") leans toward stock lyricism, dulling the final beat's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong imagery: "amber warehouse beneath the cliffs," "sand flowing backward for the first time in memory." Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "The jar's echo slithered free as he loosened the wax seal, a voice not his own curling into the stale air" restates echo/voice in adjacent clauses. "The ledger's pages rustled like dry leaves as he flipped to the final entry" is scaffolding that could be cut. The final paragraph's "waiting for the next echo to speak its name" echoes earlier phrasing without adding pressure. No major artifact in the closure beat, but cumulative density slips lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor deduction: "The wind on Zephyr Bluff carried no name, only the scent of thawing earth and the ghost of last winter's ice" leans slightly ornate for the opening urgency, and "ledger" recurs three times in close proximity without strict causal variation. Figurative language (mist swallowing, ice breaking) is controlled and purposeful. Propulsion is strong; the final beat's image ("quiet dare of a first step forward") charges the closure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most sentences layer action, atmosphere, and thematic charge. Rhythm modulates (short counts "One. … Two." against longer descriptive waves). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Deductions: "percolated upward in slow, spiraling sighs" mixes liquid/gas/breath vehicles without full coherence (−0.3). The phrase "the girl slipped free, pressing the yarn needle into the coachman's palm as she passed" compresses two actions (slip, press, pass) whose sequence and simultaneity blur slightly under high magnification (−0.2). Stock opener "Somewhere ahead, another traveler waited. Somewhere, the gutters would begin to tick again" uses template parallelism that, while thematically apt, edges toward predictable cadence (−0.2). No artifacts touch the closure beat itself, so accumulation cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("hives split open like old wounds," "time had split like wet clay"), but some metaphors feel slightly overwrought or stacked without clear payoff ("glaze shimmering like the last breath of a dying star"). A few phrases loop conceptually: "thrum" recurs four times with similar phrasing, and the "fractures/fractured" motif is touched repeatedly without advancing pressure each time. Information density is high, and no major scaffold or clarity breaks appear, but the ornamental texture in non-peak beats slightly dulls momentum. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no grammatical errors are evident.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but controlled: "copper-edged," "blade left too long in the rain," "oars in water." Two small artifacts: "instilling tiny furrows" (the verb "instill" is slightly elevated for the action) and "wistfully pragmatic offering" (the pairing, while voice-consistent, hovers near precious). The final third is clean, propulsion strong. Minor density friction in the opening paragraph where three images compete (petal, basil, harbor) before the reader has orientation, but the effect serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and internal state. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene needs. However, multiple metaphoric constructions cluster without clear vehicle coherence: "bones groaning like old ship timber," "hum like grinding teeth or a planet turning," "sound like tearing parchment"—each vivid but the mix risks register drift. Minor template cadence in interiority stems ("It wasn't rebirth. It was..."). The final beat sequence (bird took flight / Lior let it go / doors creaked / he stepped through / air smelled / clock began) propels cleanly but leans on repeated simple past in list fashion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("sky the color of old parchment," "songs stitching the air together"). However, several passages border on overwriting: "half-finished constellations—points of light that needed someone else to draw the lines between them" is decorative rather than propulsive. The dream sequence recycles motifs (temple rising, orbs dissolving into ripples) without new causal work, reading as paraphrase loop. Stock phrases appear: "held breath," "slow unfurling," "space between the words." The final paragraph's "The thread was there. It had always been there" is repetitive scaffold. Filter-verb stacks ("thought of," "understood," "smiled") cluster in reflective beats but do not severely dull immediacy. Cumulative line-level debt prevents entry to high band.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. The opening simile ("nest of angry stars") is vivid and voice-consistent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor issues: "the university's divisions felt less like wounds and more like scars—proof they'd survived something" edges toward summary in a peak moment, and "the charts fluttered as the ventilation kicked on, the inked stars seeming to shift" stacks two passive constructions where a sharper verb choice would propel. Clarity remains strong throughout; no artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high ("its teeth like the ribs of a starved god"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "fingers of light that trembled like the hands of a man" stacks two vehicles for one effect. Minor template cadence in mid-section: "The compass wasn't for measuring. It was for transfixing." and "Some doors weren't meant to be opened. They were meant to be remade." Read as intentional parallelism tied to theme, not loop. No paraphrase cycles. Clarity remains high; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well and sensory detail is dense, with strong images like "the mist curled like a held breath" and "the ribbon's twin fluttering from her fingers." However, several passages exhibit overwriting: "The quarry's jagged mouth yawned open" (mixed metaphor—mouths don't have jagged edges), "swallowing sound" immediately followed by "his boots leaving no prints" (sound/sight incongruity), and stacked elevated constructions in quick succession ("wounds remembered," "furrowing hush," "portraitist of the invisible"). Template cadence appears in the opening: "not for balance, but to memorize," "not with sound, but with resonance," "not a question but an offering." Paraphrase loop: "the dead don't return, they *echo*" is restated in various forms across the piece. Some filter-verb stacks ("he'd always known," "he didn't need," "he knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying −0.8 for overwriting density and template stems, plus −0.3 for filter stacks in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the inciting beats (tin box, journal cipher, nail hum). However, the prose carries several patterned artifacts: "not from the cold, but from the *knowing*" and "not a storm, but a *threshold*" recur as formulaic inversions. The phrase "the air *ripped*" at the climax is vivid, but the subsequent "For a heartbeat, the world split: on one side... on the other" reads as a static list rather than propulsive syntax. Paraphrase loops in the final third ("The Maw's gone" / "the sky no longer felt like a trap. It felt like a door") dull momentum. No severe opacity, but density drops post-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective, but figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "wet-plate collodion glass flake," "dynamically observant gaze," "scaffold wrap flutters," "luminous, disbelieving dawn," "sculpted from the ashes of 'never,'" "pixel by pixel" recurs without evolution. Sentence openings show some variety, but runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" create template cadence in the middle third. Two paraphrase loops: "amnesty...the kind you carved" is restated as "amnesty...something you sculpted"; "the song remained" echoes "He was the song now." Clarity is mostly intact, but the cumulative ornament slows momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high ("yen with faded cherry blossoms, francs edged in gold leaf" does double duty as setting and motif). Figurative language is controlled and voice-appropriate. Three line-level issues lower the score: "relics overnight" and "glass skeletons glinting…like the ribs of something starved" stack metaphors in adjacent beats without clear vehicle coherence; "dissipating into the air the way all grand plans did, eventually" is a slight thematic echo that borders on redundancy with prior material; and "Some questions, like some trains, weren't meant to reach a destination" explicates rather than trusts the image. No loops or template cadence detected; the closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase: "The burden *was* shared" immediately follows the revelation, restating without new pressure; "not of dreams, but of the hands that held them" is graceful but conceptually redundant with prior material. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("He reached out—and the star *answered*. A voice… threaded through the silence"). Figurative language is dense without always advancing clarity—"wounds," "balm," "lattice," "chorus," "tapestry" cluster in adjacent beats, occasionally blurring rather than sharpening. No pronoun ambiguities; grammar is clean. The loop check and density expectation are not fully met at this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language is vivid ("its vines lashing like whips, splitting the air with a sound like tearing silk"). However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Some things, once found, couldn't be lost again. / Others shouldn't be." and "Some things didn't need to be found to be known. / Some things were better lost forever." are conceptual redundancies that dull momentum. The repeated "The [X] [verb]" openings ("The key burned...The first snowflake landed...The next missing thing...") create a drumbeat pattern without payoff. These artifacts touch the closure zone, warranting deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense, but several patterns undercut momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "She wasn't just walking; she was heeding" restates content without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the opening third with repeated "Her [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("time's greedy mouth," "pain transmuting into something like flight") cluster in peak beats, and elevated diction ("anxious elation," "nautilus shell") occasionally clashes with urgency. The loop/scaffold debt and figurative muddle in high-pressure moments lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Clarity remains intact, preventing deeper penalties, but density and propulsion suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "roots twisting like veins," "voice like dry leaves," "pain lanced up her arm, sweet and bright as the first light of dawn." In peak beats (the stitching, the roots pulling), metaphor stacks without consistent pattern-teaching, risking opacity ("dusky resolve of the corridor's glow" mixes light/emotion/place). Paraphrase loops appear: "the holes in her soul didn't ache. They were still there—patchwork and uneven—but they were *hers* now, not gaps to fill, but scars to carry" restates across three clauses. Template cadence emerges in the closing: "She took another step. Then another." Sentence openings vary elsewhere, and information density is generally strong. Apply −0.6 for density in pressure beats and −0.3 for paraphrase loop, total −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual pulse. Information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "quarry's echoes faded in the rearview, swallowed by the dusk" advances time, mood, and spatial exit). No paraphrase loops or template cadence across adjacent lines. Figurative language (dust motes as lighters, gravel as static) is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor: two adjacent reflective blocks in the middle third ("He was insulating emotionally…" / "Things didn't have to be rare…") paraphrase the same insight without added pressure, costing momentum. The phrase "confidently uncertain" is told rather than fully dramatized in that beat. Grammar and tense are clean; pronoun references unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, mixing short declaratives ("Nothing happened. Then the wind reversed.") with longer, lyric constructions. Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is controlled and voice-specific ("as if embarrassed by its own luminosity," "fingers of a god testing the weight of mortality"). Minor deductions for two instances of stock phrasing: "throat tightened" and "breath caught," which are functional but lack the textural specificity seen elsewhere. One scaffold phrase: "The work was the same. But the light had changed. And that was enough" edges toward platitude but is brief and serves closure rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("liquid opals," "the moon's waning pull," "voice the crackle of burning paper"), but accumulates in most sentences of key beats without always clarifying cause-effect. Paraphrase loops appear: "the objects weren't artifacts. They were molting skins" rephrases the prior realization without added pressure. Template cadence runs through several transitions ("He knelt… He understood… He shook his head…"). The final paragraph layers metaphor upon metaphor (bonfires spelling names, creel humming, spoon's reflection as held breath) in a way that diffuses rather than sharpens the closure image. Information density is high, but clarity suffers under the figurative load, and the overwriting in the closure beat triggers the escalated penalty range.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops in the opening: "damp, electric air" and "pulsing with veins of bioluminescent crystal that throbbed like a slow, buried heartbeat" restate vitality without adding pressure. Template cadence in the shell sequence: "I wanted to be seen." "I pretended not to care." "I built this place…" accumulates without syntactic variation. Figurative density in peak beats: "the light unfolded—not outward, but in, seeping through her skin, her bones" stacks metaphors that blur the physical action. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies (short fragments at the bridge: "Not forgiveness. / Not yet." alongside longer accumulative sentences earlier). Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character state, or graffiti motif. Minor loop: "The accordion bellows" re-described across three beats (cracked leather, tape, weight) without full transformation until the bridge; the repetition serves accumulation but risks redundancy. No figurative muddle; "old bruises" sky and "door opening" bellows remain clear. Sentence openings show variety (participial, subject-first, prepositional). One weak passive: "had been" in "had been both, once" could tighten to "was both, once." Proofreading clean; no tense slips or unclear antecedents.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or symbolic language—which creates texture but risks overwriting in peak beats ("heart no longer a cipher, but a door" stacks abstraction at closure). Minor paraphrase loops: "The library groaned, its glow dimming" followed by "shelves began to collapse inward" restates dissolution. Template cadence appears in the final third: "Some things didn't need... Some things only needed..." registers as purposeful parallelism but borders on scaffold. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates with pressure, but information density dips in expository beats ("The watch wasn't just a key—it was a thief"). No major clarity breaks, but elevated diction and stacked metaphors dull immediacy in the sprint sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies (short crisis lines, longer reflective passages) and information density is high. Several figurative clusters in high-pressure beats border on overwriting: "liquid silver," "prismatic needles," "delicate, humming crystals" in the smashing sequence; metaphor density slightly dulls propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs three and four both establish Elara's gift origin and plant-memory theme with overlapping phrasing ("accidentally, unwanted" / "knew the weight of a dream"). No pronoun drift or grammar breaks. Tightening the metaphor load in the climax would lift clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("walls woven from petrified mist," "light that wasn't light but something older"). However, the piece shows mild overwriting: most sentences in the grotto sequence carry metaphor or simile without respite, creating a lyric saturation that slows momentum. One paraphrase loop: "the threshold of stillness wasn't the end. / It was the space between what was said and what was heard" restates without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("She had come... She had found... She pressed... She infused") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "understood," "knew") cluster in high-pressure beats, triggering −0.5 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and key images (scalloped edges, twilight shoot) do multiple jobs. Minor overwriting: "a thousand unspoken names" and "sky bled into violet" edge toward stock lyricism. A brief paraphrase loop: "forgiveness wasn't the same as forgetting the hollow it carved" near-echoes earlier grief-scalloping language. Figurative density in the grotto beat is purposeful and pattern-taught. Propulsion remains strong through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the unhooking sequence. Concrete action (kneeling, trembling fingers, thread dissolving into foam) propels the middle. Several scaffold patterns accumulate: "The wind X, and the Y Z" structure repeats (wind howled/chimes screamed, wind chimes laughed, wind chimes sighed). Paraphrase loop: "not with the usual golden command, but in fragile strips" closely echoes the later "not by banishing dark, but by learning its shape." Late-paragraph abstractions ("gloriously, terribly unclear," "sacred heaviness") stack figurative language without grounding in action. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and loops touching non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lyric and controlled with strong figurative language: "spine straight as a sycamore," "years peel away… like petals from a dying flower," "syllable of wind." However, several beats carry paraphrase loops—"his body unraveling its own years" immediately followed by "felt the years peel away" restates the same content without adding pressure. Template cadence in memory beats ("He was twenty again, then fifteen, then eight") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "saw") in the trance passage lower density. The closure image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high without overwhelming clarity. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "He didn't need to see...but he heard it anyway" / "He didn't need to see to know" repeats the construction; "pulse" and "echo" recur across many lines without evolving meaning; "The canyon held its breath. Then, the echo came" uses stock suspense pacing. Template cadence is present in multiple "The skimmer [verb]" openings. Some metaphors are strained ("things that moved like hunger"). Information density is moderate; several beats restate the skimmer's stillness without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (the candle's whisper, the folly's shift, the keystone's reveal). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not old, just *unfinished*" restates "smudged like a sketch"; "the sacred in the simple" is reiterated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the climb paragraph ("his fingers numb, his robes stiff"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("jagged tooth of ice," "crackle of old parchment"); no mixed metaphors harm clarity. The final beat—"Louder" and the roaring flame—propels cleanly, but cumulative loops and stems pull the score down per the artifact pack (−0.6 to −0.8 range).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong opening and closing images. Sentence variety supports the lyric accumulation, and the piece avoids major loops or scaffolding. However, figurative density is high throughout, and several metaphors stack without clear payoff: "boots left no prints" (immateriality?), "lantern swinging like a metronome counting down to dawn" (urgency or routine?), "beam cutting through dust motes like a blade through veil after veil of half-truths" (mixed vehicle—beam as blade cutting veils). In the climactic library sequence, phrases like "pages fused into brittle sculptures of lost knowledge" and "the *Marigold* groaned around him, a chorus of creaking timber and sighing metal, each note vibrating in his bones with hues he almost recognized—cobalt despair, amber longing" pile decoration onto a beat that would gain from compression. The transition "—until Elias stood alone on the pier again" uses an em-dash to leap across a causal gap, obscuring how the vision dissolved and what immediate action or realization prompted his return. No major grammatical errors, but the elevated diction in peak beats reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in most beats. Minor loop: "The static wasn't noise. / It was a voice" and "The coins weren't keys. / They were mirrors" recur as a formulaic pattern. The phrase "hummed in the negative space between vibrations" and later "in the negative space between what had been and what would be" is near-paraphrase. Figurative language is dense (amber, static as Morse, wavelengths, coins as mirrors) but mostly coherent. No grammar errors. The loops and template cadence warrant deduction but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the piece avoids major loops. However, patterned artifacts cluster in the final third: "Something newly named. / Something that had not forgotten" and "The stars watched. / The monsters waited" employ identical template cadence (noun phrase + relative clause / Subject + verb) across multiple beats. "Echoes were just sacrifices waiting to be heard" in the penultimate sequence, then "echoes waiting to be heard" again two lines later, creates a paraphrase loop. Filter-verb stacks ("he had," "he knew," "he watched") appear in three consecutive lines mid-story. These artifacts dull immediacy in high-pressure moments but do not obscure causality. No major coherence breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "spine of frozen lightning," "stone veins pulsing," "bronze throat split," "note...slithered," "water churned like a waking beast," "silver flank flashing like a blade"—most sentences carry metaphor, triggering the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Template cadence appears in the fish-return sequence: "Then another. / And another." Minor paraphrase loop: "The imbalance was not gone" repeats conceptually across two beats. Information density is strong, and propulsion is clear, but the metaphor load at high-pressure beats reduces clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines do double work (wind chime = silence motif, liqueur label = tactile relic + visual echo). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled: "reservoir's buried bones," "held breath," "smoke from a hundred extinguished lanterns." Deductions: "cloying sweetness" is stock; "the way it had taken everything else—only this time, it gave something back" is a paraphrase loop of the prior sentence's implicit claim; "hands…reaching not to pull him under, but to lift" over-explains the image. The phrase "reservoir's hush mirrored his own, no longer empty, but full" in the penultimate section stacks two abstract states without concrete grounding. Paragraph structure varies and no major pronoun or tense slips. The scaffold "Not as a warden this time. / But as a son" is effective parallelism, not template cadence, but the final paragraph's list of "how" clauses edges toward summary drag.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled; no loops or scaffold churn. Clarity is high; spatial and temporal sequencing tracks cleanly. Weakness: several sentences in the transformation sequence carry stacked modifiers and elevated register ("kaleidoscopic fury," "ozone and possibility," "quiet, stubborn truth") that accumulate into mild overwriting. The final paragraph's "didn't wonder what came next. / She *knew.*" pivot is clean, but the preceding line ("she didn't wonder...some things are meant to be held, not solved") paraphrases the same realization, triggering a −0.2 paraphrase-loop deduction. Information density is generally high, but peak beats could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully with strong propulsion: "Then she stepped into the dark. / The parachute deployed with a soundless snap." Information density is high; most lines advance character and stakes. Clean grammar and spatial choreography. Deductions: "a man who had taught her to listen to the spaces between sounds, to see the weight of absence" stacks abstractions without concrete grounding; "the burden of knowing" and "the watcher's burden" loop conceptually across paragraphs two and six. Filter-verb reliance ("she had chosen," "she had spent") slightly dulls immediacy in places. No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifact patterns cluster in high-pressure beats: "pulsing faintly," "pulsed faster," "brains twitched" rely on repeated stems; "the one labeled," "the one holding" template cadence in the opening; "through the pretense like a honed blade" and "tearing silk" lean stock-metaphor. The phrase "crushing, glorious *all* of it" in the climax reads as emotional summary rather than concrete embodiment. Paraphrase micro-loops appear ("history rewrote itself... history had stopped rewriting itself"). These issues dull immediacy at key moments. Proofreading is clean and syntax varies purposefully elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("ghost of a thousand leaf blowers," "brittle things, shattering"). Clarity is strong in most beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Maybe the unspoken didn't need tending. Maybe it just needed to be heard" restates the same insight across two sentences without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the dream sequence: "That night, Elias dreamed… He woke… Outside, the first leaves…" (three consecutive transit beats with identical stem structure, −0.4). The metaphor "hourglass…finally full" contradicts its earlier "last grain slipped" imagery (−0.3 for mixed metaphor). Information density is high elsewhere, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening's long breath gives way to clipped exchanges and then dissolves into the lyric final sequence. "She'd heard them for years, a low murmur beneath the creak of shelves and the sigh of turning leaves, but now they were shouting" is dense and propulsive. However, "edges blurring like ink in water" and "roots reversing" are stock metaphors, and "vast, breathing page" borders on purple in a high-pressure beat. No loops or major clarity breaks, but figurative density in the climax nudges the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense—"teeth," "blackened lace," "frozen bloom"—but several beats show overwriting: "sickly gold, like light filtered through bruised skin" stacks metaphor without added clarity. Template cadence appears in the feeding sequence: "Each offering made... Then he fed it doubt... The crozier shuddered." Paraphrase loop: "The explosion was silent. A wave of frozen bloom unfurled..." restates the same event. Filter-verb stack in the middle ("He jerked back... what if destruction wasn't the end? What if it was the method...") dulls immediacy. These artifacts cluster but don't fully obscure closure; applying −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense ("drunken sentinels," "lightning made gentle," "gorge swallowed her laughter and spat it back as light") and occasionally mixed (how does a gorge spit laughter as light?). Paraphrase loops appear: "not absence, but a presence" followed by "the kind that lived in the pause" restates without added pressure. Syntactic variety is present, but metaphoric coherence slips in peak beats, and the final image's vehicle (air/laughter/light transformation) lacks physical logic within the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "blade through silk," "needle through too many layers of fabric," "liquid silver," "schools of fish," "trapped starlight." In peak beats this risks overwriting without clear payoff. Template cadence appears in parallel clauses: "She adjusted… feeling… the pull… the push…" and "the laugh of a child… the last breath of a fisherman…" creating rhythmic monotony. The hourglass's arc (empty, feeding, full, rising sand) is clean, but pervasive metaphor dilutes urgency during the five-minute collapse window.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is controlled and information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or concept. However, pervasive figurative language—"fever dream architect," "rational enchantment," "sinew thread coiled in his pocket, a filament spun from his own memories—realistically imaginary, pliable as thought but sharp as glass"—creates a dense metaphorical texture that risks obscuring concrete causality in peak beats. The eruption sequence layers abstract constructions ("the weight of a name on the tip of your tongue," "the collective exhalation of strangers recognizing themselves") without grounding them in specific sensory action, leaving clarity just below high-band thresholds. Paraphrase check: "the gallery was just a room, the visitors just people, and the void just an empty frame" repeats structure for effect, acceptable but close to template cadence. No loops or scaffolding detected; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery—"skin like polished basalt," "chalk snapping against the edge"—and purposeful rhythm in the opening sentence's layered structure. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Not late / Just recalibrating" followed by extended explanation, and the chain link's properties are restated across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the exposition: "They navigated by starlight, they'd told her" and "The aliens had shown her" both introduce backstory in similar constructions. The closing micro-chapter ("The next morning...") adds a satisfying accelerando but also recycles the "look up" idea already established. Information density is high in sensory passages but thins during reflective blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is controlled and mostly apt ("mist curled," "static hissed," "breath fogging the mic"). However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "He wasn't a hero" appears twice within close proximity, and "The dead didn't speak. They *lingered.*" / "They needed *witnesses.*" / "Some echoes weren't meant to stay buried" form a thematic churn that reiterates rather than advances. Minor template cadence in "He didn't know... He wasn't... He was..." clusters. The closure beat is clean, but mid-story scaffold ("Curiosity had always been his undoing—the trait his supervisors called...") slows momentum. Information density is generally high; propulsion holds through most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear frequently: "The cables weren't just tracking invisible things. They were *keeping* them" closely echoes prior assertions about cables that "learned" and "remembered." Multiple sentences open with template stems ("Elias didn't…," "He'd come…," "He should have…," "He hadn't come…") creating rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("cables as serpents," "silence that wasn't empty but *full*") and elevated diction ("the crushing dark," "invisible light") cluster in high-pressure beats, reducing specificity. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase/template accumulation and −0.3 for register drift, totaling −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats (death certificate, static silence, porcelain shard history). However, several lines loop conceptually: "the static isn't empty. It's waiting" is paraphrased by "Now you know what the static hides." The phrase "infinite and unbroken" echoes "perfect, unbroken patterns" within two paragraphs. Figurative language clusters heavily in the final third ("chorus," "vast and unknowable," "fragments… finally whole") without pattern-teaching, applying −0.5 in Q7. The final image is vivid but the conceptual loop and density of metaphor in peak beats lower clarity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high, and figurative language ("grit of consonants," "silk of vowels") charges texture. Yet paraphrase loops appear: "The canyon answered—not with words, but with the texture of them" restates the premise across adjacent lines, and the coda section recycles "The canyon / the towers / the starlings" in parallel template cadence without adding new pressure. The loop and scaffold artifacts cluster in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the final third: "some stories didn't need endings / they needed roots" → "And the garden, after all, was endless. / So was the joke. / (So was the static.)" recycles the same thematic claim without new pressure, and parenthetical refrains ("(And something was always listening.)") repeat conceptually adjacent lines. Template cadence dominates: "The missing never returned… / But sometimes… / (And if you listened…) / The herbalist hung up…" chains four consecutive moves with identical stem structure. Stock metaphors ("harmony untamed," "frostbitten hope") and therapy-speak interiority ("bitterness had become his religion") flatten peak beats, and the arrowhead's metamorphosis into seed is told rather than shown through Elias's embodied perception of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("petals long since replaced by brass gears," "wings catching the light like shattered stained glass," "the way a wound remembers a blade") without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure; several metaphors are vivid but add texture rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "She played louder" / "but the violinist didn't stop" restate continuation without added pressure. Template cadence is present in repeated sentence stems ("The statues turned," "The statues didn't collapse," "The violinist stepped," "The violinist closed her eyes"). "Resonantly soft" recurs but without evolving meaning. Clarity remains intact, so artifacts do not obscure closure, but momentum suffers. Apply −0.8 for distinct figurative saturation and loop issues under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density is high (storm mechanics, drone gap, Lira's letter-fostering, post office haunting compressed efficiently). Two minor artifacts: "a thunderstorm in a bottle, its glass cool against his palm, the trapped wind howling when he tilted it just right" stacks modifiers without advancing plot in that beat; "Again. And again. Until the absences linked up…" loops the closure declaration. Figurative density is elevated ("twilight bled violet," "bruises," "wax seals and torn edges") but serves tone without obscuring cause/effect. No grammar errors; pronoun references clear; spatial sequencing tracks cleanly. Propulsion is solid through high-pressure beats (drone approach, post office entry) but softens slightly in the thematic summation at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language mostly serves pressure: "halo fragment," "edges jagged like a broken promise," "wind chime—its pipes green with age—swayed without wind." Two issues reduce clarity at closure: "shaping the air between them into something tangible, a melody of sawdust and rust" blurs the literal action (what does hand-shaping look like?), and the final paragraph stacks three metaphors (silence as door, doors built piece by piece, wind chime as invitation) without grounding the tactile present. Paraphrase loop: "It felt like a door. / They were meant to be built." No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the figurative density in the ending beat obscures the concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high in key beats (the scarf ritual, the tessellations pulsing). However, figurative language saturates several passages without clear pattern-teaching: "satellites orbiting a forgotten planet," "fossils of someone's fleeting clarity," "stories are just shapes we've forgotten how to fold," and "chewing the silence into something sweet" cluster within a narrow window. The metaphor density in the ritual sequence (threads as roots, curvature as habitat, library as mouth) reads coherent but borders on ornamental layering. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("whispering archipelago," "saltwind," "smeared charcoal," "schools of fish beneath the surface," "match in a hurricane"), occasionally stacking metaphors in adjacent sentences without pattern payoff. Lines like "the cipher of light unraveling" and "luminous absence between dawn and memory" elevate diction past the POV's immediate sensory access during high-pressure beats. Paraphrase appears: "press the spine of a runaway dream" and "vitalize them" restate the premise multiple times across paragraphs. Information density is high, but momentum sags in the middle third with decorative description ("her dress woven from the same mist") that doesn't advance the attempt or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory specificity is strong ("the ribbon's knot resisted every tool but her smallest, crookedest pick"). However, minor pattern artifacts appear: "The locksmith had a rule," "The locksmith had spent," "The locksmith's own mother"—three consecutive paragraph stems anchor to the protagonist's title rather than varied syntax. The final third sustains momentum without loops, and figurative language ("map blooming," "wound pooling") remains coherent. Information density is high and the closure image is clear, but the stem repetition merits a small deduction within Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies effectively, and sentence openings shift across the piece. Information density is high in key beats (residue mechanics, pedestal discovery, memory-eater's trade logic). However, minor scaffold appears: "The thief wasn't just stealing. / It was *trading.*" and "He had spent decades chasing the past, but what if the past was the thing that had been chasing *him*?" both paraphrase concepts already dramatized. The line "his fingers brushing the gills of a fairy ring mushroom that shouldn't have grown there" front-loads mystery effectively, and the closing exchange is crisp. Stock metaphor ("drowned leviathan") and one register drift ("iridescent residue" in a high-pressure beat) slightly dull immediacy, but figurative language overall remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Minor loop: "The library groaned... shelves shuddering" and "The library sighed, settling" are near-synonyms that restate the library's animate quality without added pressure (−0.3). One stock phrase: "holding its tongue" (−0.2). Figurative language is controlled except "tired light" in the opening, which blurs agency. No filter-verb stacks. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high in the veil-crossing and succor beats; "juice that bled onto his fingers was thick, electric" compresses sensation and consequence efficiently. Template cadence surfaces in adjacent lines: "The villagers would call it a miracle. / Elias would call it a debt. / That night..." and "The trees would not forget. / Neither would the girl." Paraphrase loop: "wonder was not something you kept" is restated as "passed through, like a knife through flesh, like a seed through soil" without added pressure. Figurative density in the final third ("echo of what it had touched," "quiet, radiant hush," "language made of light") stacks metaphor without concrete payoff, triggering −0.6 for patterned artifact in a closure beat and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes). Figurative language is vivid but occasionally dense without respite: "flame bending like a held breath," "spun from spider's patience," "interlaced hush of a thousand confessions," "singing pressure" cluster in peak beats and risk obscuring immediacy. Template cadence appears in the final third: "They would call it... / They would walk... / their laughter tangled... / their silence no longer..." (four parallel constructions in close succession). Clarity holds, but the overwriting in high-pressure moments and the cadence run lower the score by −0.6 to −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high ("Not the absence of sound, but the kind that hummed..."). However, several passages loop conceptually: "silence wasn't empty. It was waiting" / "silence wasn't an absence, but a presence" recycle the same idea. Template cadence in the final third: "It felt like a key. / Elara turned off... / Outside, the rain began..." repeats short declarative + noun structure across three beats without purposeful pattern-teaching. Filter-verb density ("feeling the vibrations," "pressed her palm") in the climax slightly dulls immediacy. Overwriting is mild but present: stacked metaphors ("embers in a dying fire" + "door swinging open on hinges") without clear vehicle coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("books had bloated into pulpy sculptures," "the lie settled into her like sediment"), but verges on overwriting in high-pressure beats—mixed metaphors appear ("hands reaching through time," "sediment," "threads," "threshold") without full coherence. Template cadence shows in several sequential constructions: "She had come... She had spent... She would file..." Paraphrase loops appear ("letting go" restated multiple times; "cost of light" twice). Information density is generally high, but the closure sequence layers metaphor upon metaphor (snow falling sideways, storm breaking, horizon blurring) in ways that slightly obscure rather than sharpen the final choice. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or logic errors. The artifacts do not touch causality but do dull some peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("the air hung thick as wet silk between lightning and thunder" anchors tone and timeframe in one line). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Two frictions lower the score: "driftingly alert" as a coined descriptor feels strained against the otherwise grounded lexicon, and the phrase "a chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby" stacks metaphor without clarifying the ghost's nature—it gestures at complexity rather than specifying it. The final image ("his shadow stretching long and unbroken") propels cleanly, and the chalk-scraping echo in the valley closes with economy.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled with strong imagery ("brass cables singing," "finger pointing at the sky's indifference"). However, repeated "the way" constructions in mid-story create minor template cadence: "the way the light hit... the way the wind howled... the way the captain's goggles turned." The phrase "warmly inquisitive" in setup reads slightly label-oriented. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops. The final image delivers propulsion and specificity. Minor figurative density (broken promises, forgotten dreams, hollow bones) remains purposeful and doesn't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors and elevated diction in nearly every line ("quiet violence," "breath of every life," "ribs of the universe"). Paraphrase loops appear: "The clouds weren't just water and wind. They were the breath..." restates prior atmospheric claims without adding pressure. Template cadence is present ("He had always known... That was why... why... why") and synonym churn around "empty spaces" and "remember" recurs without propulsion. These artifacts cluster in mid- and late beats, triggering −0.8 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; many lines do lyric work but few advance causality.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high through the coin-and-safe sequence. Paraphrase loops appear: "She understood. / The guild hadn't been hoarding…" restates the instruction without added pressure (−0.2). The dream-and-wake sequence contains template cadence: "She woke… she reached… she stopped… she dipped… she painted… she hung" stacks parallel stems across six lines (−0.5). Figurative language ("like trying to catch smoke in a net," "wound in the tree") is mostly coherent, but "the color of the hush before demolition" mixes abstract and concrete awkwardly. No loops touch the closure beat directly, mitigating impact.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the discovery sequence. Three frictions lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop in the final section—"Next time, ask… Liora tucked… pressed her palm… already noting" recycles the beat of Liora continuing her work without new pressure. (2) Stock metaphor: "horizon was golden" and "vast. Not empty. Not lost. But luminous" edge toward abstraction rather than concrete image. (3) Filter-verb stack in "she thought of the phrasebook's words, of how light lingered" when the thought could be more immediate. No causality break, so penalties remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Strong images abound: "ice-encased shelves into veins of hauntingly bright silver," "water, still and black as a held breath." However, the piece exhibits template cadence in several passages: "She wasn't here for the books. / The locksmith—known in the lowland villages..." and "She didn't ask for what. / She knew." Paraphrase loops appear: the locksmith's repair motivation is restated multiple times without added pressure. Figurative language clusters densely in places ("breath curled like old ink," "ripples spread like cracks in a prophecy") without clear pattern-teaching. These artifacts touch non-closure beats, so deduction remains moderate (−0.6 for template runs, −0.3 for paraphrase).

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("ribs of a god," "shattered moons"), but several beats rely on stock metaphors ("fruit pulsed with starlight," "bloom in reverse") and figurative stacking that slows momentum without adding density. Paraphrase loops appear: "You did it" / "No...We did" is followed by two more lines restating collective effort. The final third contains explanatory scaffold ("Liora looked...and understood. This was the nebula") that tells rather than trusts the image. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she thought," "she wanted to ask") dull immediacy in mid-pressure beats. Grammar and tense are clean; clarity remains high, but propulsion sags under decorative layering at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "a slow wound through the dusk," "sickly amber that pulsed like a held breath," "voices…curling like smoke." Many sentences in high-pressure beats (the puppet head's arrival, the final insertion) layer metaphor without advancing concrete action, creating momentum drag. Paraphrase loops appear: "not from brokenness, but from fulfillment" restates the prior sentence's emotional claim without new detail. Template cadence runs: "The hush didn't break. / It *sang*." and similar short declarative pairs recur. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (the lullaby as memory and key), but scaffolding phrases ("he understood then," "for the first time in thirty years") slow propulsion. No grammar errors; syntax varies, but the elevated register is uniform and reduces urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear, rhythm varies, and information density is high in the closure beats. The opening establishes voice and stakes efficiently: "a key, a warning, and a grove of trees that bore fruit no one dared eat." The final image—mechanical birds locked by frost, traveler walking free below—charges without over-explanation. Deductions: minor paraphrase loop in the middle third (the blueprint's gears and weights are described twice in adjacent paragraphs with near-identical phrasing: "gears, pulleys, a system of weights" / "the gears had jammed, the weights had rusted"). The phrase "offhandedly exact" is told as an attribute rather than embodied in syntax or action under pressure. Template cadence appears in three consecutive sentences beginning with "She'd spent years" / "She had spent years," creating a drumbeat rhythm that flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally controlled with strong imagery (foam as sheet music, chrysalis veins catching sun). Information density is high in the opening third. However, multiple figurative vehicles cluster in some beats without clear pattern-teaching: "composer writing in haste," "missed note," "sheet music," "symphony" all appear in two opening paragraphs, creating metaphor density that borders on ornamental. Template cadence appears in several "He [verb]" constructions mid-story. The line "atonement wasn't a bridge. It was a dissolution" offers strong closure rhythm, but earlier scaffold phrases ("the grief he'd dammed up," "the last of the grief loosening") repeat the same concept across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent ("wind that smelled of old ink and ozone," "prismatic shadows"), but the final third suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She already knew the answer. / It was always the same. / The story begins where the silence breaks." These adjacent restatements dull closure momentum. The penultimate sequence ("She picked up her needle. / The slate was waiting.") recycles the setup without adding pressure. Clarity is high, but information density drops in the last 150 words, triggering −0.6 for loop/scaffold in a closure-adjacent beat.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean with strong sensory images and varied syntax. However, several artifact patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("The pavilion would call again. It always did. And he would answer" restates the same inevitability across three beats), template cadence in the opening paragraphs (repeated "Chef Elias [verb]" and "He could taste," "He'd found," "He slid" structures), and some stock metaphor work ("like broken teeth," "like ink in water"). The "sandpapering" conceit is vivid but remains metaphoric—never shown as concrete action. Filter-verb reliance appears in reflective stretches ("he thought he saw," "he felt the weight lift") where direct perception would sharpen. Information density is high in the pavilion sequence but thins in the framing sections with redundant reassurance beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but minor artifacts accumulate: "the scent of crushed grain and distant rain" feels stock; "the kind of air that promised change" is a near-cliché. Figurative density is high in places ("stars aligning in silent judgment," "her baton cutting arcs…like a scythe through wheat") without always advancing pressure. Paraphrase loop: "The silos were still standing. But now, they had bridges" restates the central image unnecessarily. Sentence openings vary, information density is moderate, and no causality breaks occur, keeping the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in most lines. Three paraphrase loops touch closure: "not as an engineer... not as an archeologist... but as the first cartographer" recycles the structure; "the canyon swallowed her footsteps whole" echoes "the canyon seemed to inhale" without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "canyon walls loomed like fractured ribs" is functional but familiar. Filter-verb stack: "she had spent," "she'd been modifying," "she had always been" clusters in exposition, dulling immediacy. Template cadence in the vision sequence: "a man laughing... a child drawing... a probe, half-buried" uses parallel stems. Apply −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template cadence touching closure; disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but the piece carries figurative density that occasionally muddles rather than propels: "clandestinely luminous" is register-elevated without clear sensory grounding, "prism-mind" recurs as label, and metaphors cluster ("gravity inverted," "air ripped," "light drank," "seeds pulsed") in rapid succession during peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear ("She hadn't come for power" restates motivation already shown). Sentence openings vary, but some stock phrases ("Dawn found her," "The mist swallowed her scream") flatten voice. No major causality breaks, and clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (each line advances action or atmosphere), and clarity remains strong. Minor deductions: "the sound of empathy, still moving" in the final line borders on abstraction after the vivid insulator-weeping and siskin-stitching images, and "symphonically minded" appears twice with near-identical phrasing. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks mar the closure beat, so non-closure issues are capped at −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language (twilight bleeding, silence pregnant, covenant rewriting in the dark) charges key images without overwhelming. Three distinct issues prevent higher scores: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("the silence wasn't empty—it was pregnant" immediately after "translate the silence into something legible"), template cadence runs cluster in the middle third ("His fingers hovered... then stopped... Tell me..."), and elevated diction ("correlating the tremors," "with thoughtfully precise deliberation") drifts above the POV's established register in peak beats. Information density is high; momentum holds. Applying the patterned-artifact pack: −0.6 baseline plus −0.2 for paraphrase loop, total −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. "The silence of a held breath," "The silence of a door left ajar"—the diary's patterned entries elevate density. Minor paraphrase loop: "empathy was a frequency you had to tune into" and "find the right frequency of words" restate the central metaphor without added pressure. The phrase "not out of fear but because he believed empathy was a frequency" edges toward expository summary mid-crisis. No major artifact clusters, but a few beats could tighten. Figurative language is controlled and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high—"bridges swaying like vines in the tide's slow breath," "scent coiled like smoke," "disapproval softening like wax." Some metaphors stack without clear pattern-teaching: "veins of the turning tide's thought," "the sway itself—the wildflower hush of a village breathing, of roots tangling in the dark." Register drifts toward lyric elevation in multiple high-pressure beats (Elders' arrival, closure), and several lines ("the first tendril broke soil at midnight, black as a bruise, unfurling with a sigh") approach purple without obscuring clarity. Minor paraphrase loop: "She pressed the seed to her palm" / "She planted the seed" / "She plucked a petal and pressed it" recycles "pressed" as a gesture. Information density is generally high, but the figurative load in consecutive sentences ("perfume wrapped around them, thick with visions" / "fears curling like smoke" / "stepped closer, journal clutched") could be pruned. No major loops or scaffold, but cumulative density in peak beats triggers a modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or world detail. However, runs of italicized emphasis (*accelerated*, *creation*, *mouth*, *pulsed*, *singing*, *instructions*, *grew*) in peak beats function as emotional scaffolding, telling the reader which moments matter rather than trusting the dramatization—this triggers the filter/artifact penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "It was something you *grew*" repeats the sapling-growth image already shown on the page. The moss-spread description ("prickled with new strength, veins thrumming") stacks generic body-charge clichés. Propulsion remains strong through the dive and discovery sequence, but line-level craft slips when the piece most needs precision.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the chase and settling in the office frame. Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting, character state, or pressure. Minor loop detected: "the wind screamed" / "the wind returned" could consolidate, and "hazy precision" in the opening paragraph describes her actions in slightly ornamental terms. The figurative language (wind as living thing, tuning fork hum) is coherent and supports the adaptive-system premise without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level clarity is strong, and sensory specificity (emerald, cobalt, sapphire, violet) creates vivid texture. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no major loops or scaffolding appear. However, figurative language is dense in most beats without escalation: "ribbons of violet and gold," "fractals," "architecture—bridges of light," "ink in water," "strokes of fire and sapphire." Mixed metaphors occasionally blur sense: sound becomes sculpture, sound becomes light, silence is a cage, breath is warm/old. Stock constructions appear: "closed her eyes," "smiled," "stepped forward." Information density is moderate; many lines do one job (describe color) rather than layering action with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the prose has texture ("the wind…a breath so soft it felt like the world had stopped to listen"). Several paraphrase loops: "the weave between worlds frayed like rotting thread" / "the weave between worlds bled together"; "the guardianship had ended in silence" / "the true danger had always been the hush." Template cadence in the middle: multiple "He [verb]" / "The [noun] [verb]" stems across adjacent paragraphs without tonal payoff. Stock metaphor "rotting thread" and "dropped into deep water" don't sharpen the particular scene. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, others ("He exhaled") mark time. Final image recharges prior motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly controlled. Minor density issues: "The halo fragment burned cold against his skin. The stars outside winked out in a final, deliberate pattern—a sequence, a proof." restates the same content (stars vanishing deliberately) without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "He let the widow's voice dissolve... let the blacksmith's anger unknot... let the child's hope flood..." reads as list rather than accumulation of cost. No major loops or artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "the hum" appears in seven paragraphs with minimal variation in meaning; "wonder" is restated across adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate: "The pendant burned. He ripped it free..." / "The woman dissolved into the glow..." / "The courier walked on..." / "The seeds in his satchel began to sing." Filter-verb stacks cluster in peak beats ("He watched, heart hammering, as it germinated..."; "feeling it thrum beneath his boots"). Stock metaphors appear in most sentences of high-pressure moments ("threads of gold," "wings unfolding," "swallowed them whole") without earning their figurative weight. The final third contains the densest artifact concentration, flattening the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong opening and closing lines; information density is high with sentences doing double work (e.g., the prism description conveys both object and maternal legacy). Rhythm varies naturally with scene pressure, accelerating in the vision sequence. Two minor issues: "firmly grounded sorrow" uses a prompt-required phrase that reads slightly ornamental, and "the awful clarity of understanding" + "terrible knowing" form a near-synonym pair across adjacent sections. No loops or scaffold in peak beats. Figurative language is controlled and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or overwrite without advancing pressure: "a raveling silence that coiled like smoke" and "the raveling silence that now lived in his lungs" repeat the same metaphor across beats. "The fabric drank the silence" mixes liquid and thread metaphors without clear vehicle. Template cadence appears in the middle ("The bead had been waiting. / She knew the legends" / "The loom was her anchor, her method")—short declarative stems that stall momentum. The closure image (loom hums, orchard waits) is clean and propulsive, so non-closure accumulation cap applies: −0.8 for loops and metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structure. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "The planet answered. Not with violence, but with a sigh" followed immediately by "the rubble shifting, settling" restates the same content. Repeated sentence stems: "He had found," "He descended," "He fed," "He shook," "He would keep." The phrase "azure defiance" and "deliberate" recur without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: silk threads "shimmering like cracked ice" under twin suns strains coherence. These artifacts cluster in mid-story beats and slightly dull momentum, triggering −0.6 in Q7 for template cadence and paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in descriptive beats: "the ghost of machinery," "a lattice of vibrations, scents, and the faintest electric thrum." However, paraphrase loops appear: "The weight of it was wrong—not in grams, but in *meaning*" closely echoes the later "The weight in her pocket grew heavier, not with mass, but with *promise*." Template cadence: "She pocketed the shard. / The weight of it was wrong" and similar short declarative runs in the final third create minor monotony. Stock metaphor: "like bones in the murmur of half-remembered dreams." No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative minor slips prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: figurative language is mostly concrete ("smooth as a held breath," "the world outside was all teeth and salt"), and rhythm varies purposefully. Information density is high—most sentences do double work (e.g., "The skiff could wait" conveys choice, stakes, and tone). Two clusters of mild overwriting: the final section repeats the "lamp was dead / light wasn't / neither was he" structure for emphasis, but it borders on summary; and "the silence felt like an invitation" + "the tower breathed" + "the stones humming like a choir" in close succession pile metaphor at the closure beat. One paraphrase loop: "the stones settling like a held note finally released" echoes "the flame bend toward the glass like a held note" from two paragraphs prior without clear escalation. Apply −0.6 for figurative density and loop touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and the prose carries density (lantern hum, ozone scent, wind chorus). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The storm wasn't coming; it was already here" echoes "the storm would return. It always did." Template cadence runs flatten peak beats ("She smiled. The work was never done. That was the point."). Stock metaphors accumulate without transformation ("slow heartbeat," "ripe fruit," "drowning man reaching"). Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure moments ("could feel," "swore it carried") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in the opening (three consecutive "The [noun]" stems) and a paraphrase loop mid-story ("not to him, but through him" / "not for the images, but for each other") reduce propulsion slightly. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "a held breath" for iridescence works, though "the texture of crushed petals" for voice is ornamental. No causality breaks. Clarity and momentum hold through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph structure creates visual breath. Information density is high in peak beats: "He pressed his palm to the largest shard of glass and felt it then—a sorrow, quantified. Not his own." Strong verbs and specific nouns predominate (trowel, mortar, brass arms, horizon mirror). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity holds throughout with no ambiguous pronouns or tense drift. Minor deductions: "the kind of thing astronomers left behind when they realized the sky was too heavy to measure" and "every dropped thing—every scream, every shattered tool, every unspoken apology" approach list-structure patterning; the triple repetition of "somewhere" in the penultimate section ("Somewhere, an astronomer...Somewhere, a tree...And Elias?") is purposeful but risks chant-like rhythm that slightly flattens propulsion. The final beats recover momentum cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; short declarative beats ("The trees groaned") alternate with longer lyric passages. Information density is high in opening exposition but thins in the final third where villagers' arrival and their instant understanding feel like scaffolding ("They didn't ask what had happened. They knew."). Metaphoric density runs heavy without always clarifying: "swaddle the dying realm," "wrap its wounds in the very fabric," "thread of harmony, thin as spider silk" cluster without distinct vehicles. Two paraphrase loops: "The trees shuddered" / "The trees shuddered again" and "The light swaddled her" / similar phrasing about light. No major grammatical errors. The phrase "alchemical orchard" and "mirror world" repeat as labels without fresh context. Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence runs. The closure image (shards dissolving "like sugar in tea") is fresh but the surrounding lines ("the harmony carry her," "the light would not be trapped") rely on abstract claims rather than concrete final action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; opening and closing lines are strong. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several lines loop conceptually: "a sanctuary hidden in plain sight, a collection of truths no one sought" and "the paradox of leaving while staying" restate the nestled-paradox premise without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors appear ("phantom limbs," "bleeding ink"). The phrase "the witching hour" is cliché. The sentence "She would return. But not to hide" breaks for emphasis but edges toward tell. Figurative language is dense without being muddy, but the accumulation can slow momentum in a high-pressure beat (the mirror encounter).

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in places ("the river now ran backward on Tuesdays"), but the piece leans on lyric metaphor in nearly every high-pressure beat without always advancing causality—"unspooling like a memory," "whispered over a fire no one had lit," "tenuous for words" pile figurative language without distinct payoff. Two paraphrase loops: "the bread would keep rising, where the ordinary had finally, mercifully, uncloaked itself" restates the prior paragraph's resolution. Minor template cadence in the litany of city wounds ("the bakery's disappearance, the prince's quiet exile, the way the river..."). No artifacts touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and the prose is dense with specificity ("frostbitten leather," "ozone and old paper," "breath misting the page"). However, several lines loop: "The library groaned, ice shifting" restates the collapsing shelf beat; "The slide flickered" and "The lantern slide flared" echo without advancing new information. The phrase "something else entirely" in the penultimate paragraph is generic filler. "A beginning" as a one-sentence paragraph is a scaffold assertion. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies effectively and information density is high in action beats. Figurative language is controlled ("like a noose," "the first crack in the ice") and serves pressure. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "sound of trust breaking" is restated across three separate paragraphs without added nuance, and "Papa had taken the deal. / Now Lena knew why" is immediately followed by near-restatement. Template cadence in the closing: "She didn't need... She'd carry it... She'd made her peace..." Stack of declarative "she" stems flattens momentum in the final paragraph. No artifacts touch closure image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose carries high figurative density throughout, with metaphors generally coherent ("petals trembling like static," "the air brushed back"). However, the accumulation borders on overwriting: nearly every sentence in the second half layers cosmic imagery without clear propulsion or rest. "Terrestrially cosmic" reads as contradictory diction. Minor paraphrase loop: "not water, but light" / "not a warning… an invitation" uses parallel negation twice in quick succession. Information density is solid, but rhythm flattens under the weight of elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies (short bursts at the lock turn: "The cave groaned. The painting's surface rippled..."; longer lyric sentences in reflection). Information density is high in the painting-split sequence. Two small issues: "colors he'd never been brave enough to use" and "half-breathed idea" are near-synonyms for the same suppression concept within two paragraphs (paraphrase loop, −0.2). "The last echo wasn't laughter this time. It was the sound of a seal breaking" repeats the echo frame without adding pressure (−0.2 cumulative). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong imagery: "letters...curling like dying petals," "words bleed." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Two friction points lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loops ("He wrote until his ink ran dry, until the letters around him stilled" repeats structure without added pressure), and (2) a few figurative constructions stack without breathing room ("blisters," "choked," "poison," "brine" cluster in the opening paragraph). Sentence variety and rhythm support urgency, and no grammatical errors appear.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in key beats. However, the piece carries multiple prose artifacts: near-paraphrase loops ("She didn't need to see to know" / "She didn't speak. She didn't need to"), elevated metaphors in adjacent lines ("kinetic sculptures that moved with the wind" / "spiral of brass and tensioned silk"), and template cadence in the valley-contrast passage ("they had stopped asking" / "But Liora tuned"). The final paragraph stacks three scaffold transitions ("She didn't speak. She didn't need to. The symphony was already written.") that dull the closure image. Filter-verb density remains acceptable and no mixed metaphors break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies well ("He didn't breathe, but his diaphragm hitched anyway"), information density is high (most lines advance character, world, or pressure), and figurative language is controlled except for one cluster in the opening paragraph where "hummed like a dying bee," "jagged rainbows," and "thorns remembered his touch" stack without clear pattern. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence openings vary. The phrase "static in his chest cavity wasn't from faulty wiring" / "static in his core wasn't an error" / "static in his chest smoothed" recurs three times but each instance advances pressure, so the repetition reads purposeful rather than looped.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong. Some paraphrase loops appear: "whispers" / "hummed," "tick-tick" repeated three times, "sandstorm calm" / "soft" / "quiet" cluster without clear escalation. The opening's "slow exhale" and "half-remembered secret" risk overwriting but remain legible. The final paragraph's "carrying a box of records and a story she hadn't yet learned to tell" is slightly redundant with the prior "untold stories" framing. Information density is high; no major scaffold or template cadence runs.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("ocean's currents swirled like a spider spinning its web" works; "vulnerability was a cipher waiting to be cracked, its solution not in hiding, but in transformation" verges on abstract theme-speak). Paraphrase loop detected: "The scientist had been trying to encrypt his fear, to turn it into something unbreakable. But Lira understood now—strength wasn't in the locking away. It was in the act of setting free" restates the same idea across three sentences without added pressure, triggering −0.2. Template cadence in the final section: "She had come… she had decoded… that, she thought, was…" runs a parallel structure across multiple beats without taught pattern, triggering −0.4. Minor filter-verb stack in "she would smile and say… she would trace… she had come… she had decoded" (−0.3). Total artifact penalty: −0.9 in Q7. The closure image itself remains clean, so high-band entry is not foreclosed, but accumulated line debt prevents 9+ and caps at 8.7 per high-band rules.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. The opening ("moved through the docks like a shadow with a flame") and closure image (tide rolling in, "something *stirred*") are strong. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "memories didn't fade. They were *excavated*" is immediately followed by "That was why he'd started digging," restating the same idea. Template cadence appears in the pocket-inventory opening and the repetitive "The chamber was... the crystals... the air..." sequence. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in this category and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops touch pivotal beats: "The prophecy's weight had lessened, its edges softened" immediately follows "It wasn't gone. But it was no longer a scream. Just a sigh"—three lines restating the same content without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third ("For now, she was still. / For now, she was whole. / For now, the hush was hers"). Stock metaphors ("serpent of soundless syllables," "tranquil blaze") accumulate without fresh specificity. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (the snap, the lunge) obscures rather than sharpens causality. Apply −0.9 for loops and template artifacts; these touch the closure section, so disallow 9+ globally and cap high bands at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most lines advance world logic (language of buildings), character arc (listener to interrogator), or atmosphere (meteor showers, wisteria question marks). Minor paraphrase loop: "the tutor said" / "Veyra stated" / "the tutor murmured" recurs across adjacent beats without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "wisteria vines curled like question marks" and "steam curling into the shapes of forgotten letters" lean decorative. Rhythm varies appropriately; the final paragraph's short declaratives ("He kept the seal. And when...") accelerate closure momentum. No major scaffolding or template cadence runs, but figurative density in the rooftop lesson paragraph slightly slows the beat without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("the exact shade of light through the library window," "trapped like fireflies in amber," "petals unfolding in shapes that spelled her name") without pattern-teaching or payoff escalation; multiple adjacent lines stack metaphor in the archival beat, reducing clarity. Minor paraphrase loop: "Not gone. *Archived.*" echoes "her chest was empty" within two lines without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports mood, but the elevated register persists uniformly across calm and crisis beats. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or continuity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening anchors voice and stakes with vivid images (heritage rose thorn, aurora bleeding violet). Information density is high in the first half, but the second half includes paraphrase loops ("The unfinished was forgiven" restates prior content without new pressure) and template cadence in the closing sequence ("He took the slate, dipped the chalk, and wrote... The child's gasp was the sound..."). Figurative language is dense and often effective (ink bleeding upward, names rising like mist), yet mixed metaphors appear ("throne room empty of its tyrant" contradicts the Emperor's on-page presence moments earlier) and stock phrases recur (pearl twilight, low and rusted). The artifacts cluster in the final third, dulling closure momentum and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Opening and closing images are strong: "cool, silvered stone" and "only the wind" frame the arc with tactile specificity. However, the piece suffers from figurative density without consistent pattern-teaching—metaphors like "throats of the earth," "ribs of a beast still breathing," and "the universe's secret song" stack without building cumulative pressure. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "the echoes weren't memories. They were answers" immediately followed by re-explanation of the nexus's function. Template cadence emerges in the descent sequence with repeated "Then, the" constructions. The final paragraph summarizes rather than trusting the shell-shattering image to close, adding scaffolding that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies naturally, information density high ("its hull splitting like a wishbone"), figurative language purposeful ("breath fogging the air between candles, their flames stretched thin"). Opening and closing images anchor effectively. Minor loop detected: "The widow's breath hitched" followed shortly by "the widow, still trembling"—near-synonym emotional restating. One template stem run: "Lena [verb]" structure repeats four times in the closure third without lyric payoff. No filter-verb stacks or major opacity; propulsion clear.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("firefly season," "moon carved a silver road," "stirring the dark until it shimmered"). Two frictions lower the score: (1) a paraphrase loop in the final third ("complete, but never truly finished" closely echoes "the cycle began again" without added pressure), and (2) the penultimate paragraph's thematic summary ("Some efforts, after all, were meant to stay hidden...") reads as scaffold rather than scene work, dulling momentum just before closure. Information density is high elsewhere, sentence openings vary, and sensory specificity (tines "splayed like the legs of a startled spider") elevates texture. No major grammatical slips or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("spent hours piecing them together on the hood of his rusted truck, fingers sticky with sap"). However, several paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences appear: "The diamond wasn't glowing. It wasn't even impressive" restates in adjacent lines; "Elias didn't believe in curses. But he believed in patterns" is a mechanical toggle. The phrase "not X but Y" recurs as a template cadence ("not secret cabals, but bureaucrats," "not dead but unspooling," "not burying…but sealing," "not an accident but a quarantine," "wasn't hiding the curse…was hiding the cure"). Cumulative −0.6 for template runs and paraphrase loops. The final third contains elevated diction ("uncoiling," "refracted") that fits voice, but clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or stakes. However, overwriting appears in clusters: "The storm didn't howl—it whispered, a static hum" immediately followed by "swirling indigo veins pulsing faintly" stacks figurative language without breathing. Template cadence emerges in the final third ("He wasn't just... He was..." / "The dawn wouldn't be... It would be..."), and synonym churn ("hissed and spat," "slithered... wet and warm") pads some beats. The portico's mechanics—drinking the receiver, reflecting the doubled figure—are vivid but border on mixed metaphor (glass as water, glass as mirror, glass as door). Paraphrase loops appear: "prophets weren't born; they were assembled" / "He wasn't just the needle anymore. He was the hand" restate transformation without adding pressure. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well and sensory detail is concrete. However, multiple beats exhibit figurative density without sufficient pattern-teaching: "stories unspooling like silk," "first sliver of sun bled," "eyes burn," "storm clouds," within close proximity. The phrase "positively wistful" reads as forced register. Minor paraphrase loop: "This was it—the gleaned redemption" followed immediately by restating the same realization. Template cadence appears in the opening: "Sand had crept... pages of half-finished verses... He exhaled, watching... His fingers brushed..." Deduct approximately −0.6 for density and scaffold in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the artifact in the lighthouse basement wasn't a relic. It was a bomb" and "they didn't understand" could condense. Template cadence: "She descended...She knelt...She turned the key" clusters identical stems in the climax. Stock metaphor: "sunset bled gold" and "bruised sky." "Fleshly" in "the cost would be fleshly" reads as prompt-label insertion rather than organic diction. Filter-verb stack: "she understood...she laughed...she smiled...she'd left" in the final section. The line "a chord so pure it peeled the salt from the air" is vivid, but adjacency to multiple artifacts lowers cumulative density. Apply −0.8 for loops, template stems, and filter stack touching closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often vivid ("surface a single breath of glass," "a thousand drawn bows") and rhythm varies purposefully. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The revolution would not come in the clamor..." is restated as "The real work had never been in the breaking. It had been in the waiting," and again as "The revolution had no need for haste. It was already here." Template stems recur ("He had spent...," "The others would...," "Lior knew...") across multiple paragraphs. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "unyoking of weight from burden" and "patience sculpted from...stone of impatience" both work. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, high information density, concrete sensory anchors. Opening grounds voice and stakes efficiently. Figurative language (wrung-out rag, constellation of stars) serves pressure without excess. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Minor scaffold appears in transitions ("He stood," "He crouched") but propulsion remains clear. The phrase "raw, jagged edge of breaking free" edges toward stock metaphor but doesn't obscure the beat. Overall clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages loop or paraphrase: "Not for forgiveness. / For the work" echoes "He wasn't waiting for absolution. / He was making it" within two beats. The metaphor "melody cutting through the downpour like light through storm clouds" is vivid but the "light through cracks" motif recurs three times without meaningful variation. Figurative density in the middle third—"fractured light," "sighed," "breath caught between sorrow and relief"—risks overwriting but remains legible. Minor filter-verb stacks ("thought of," "saw," "knew") dull immediacy in reflective beats. No major artifacts touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate ("groaning," "skimmed," "burped"). However, figurative language clusters in several beats without clear pattern-teaching: "rusted prayer," "fractured light spin stories," "unspooled the sky's seams," "conducting" (metaphor for flight). The kaleidoscope and arrow tip descriptions veer into elevated diction ("frequencies no ear had yet grown to hear") that strains clarity under pressure. Minor template cadence in the middle section: "She pried it free... She lashed the arrow... Then she kicked off." The final leap sequence is propulsive, but the overwriting in the kaleidoscope beat and the "irreverent awe" tag slightly dull momentum. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance plot or atmosphere. The opening "hummed like a dying star" establishes voice immediately. However, template cadence appears in three consecutive "The [noun] [verbed]" constructions mid-story ("The feed cut… then reformed… Lena's hands shook. The **missing persons**…"). Minor paraphrase loop: "deleted lived on as whispers" and "echo of forgotten songs" restate the same concept adjacently. No major loops touch the closure beat, keeping the final paragraph clean.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies effectively, and the prose is imagistic with high information density in many lines. However, overwriting appears in clusters: "its gnarled apple trees clinging to the cliffside like old men gripping walking sticks, their roots tangled in the salt-cracked earth" stacks metaphor and detail without advancing pressure. Stock phrases recur ("the space where doubt lived," "a knife's edge") and some lines paraphrase earlier content ("not as a peacekeeper, not as a shadow, but as the one foolish enough…" restates the prior decision). Figurative density in non-peak beats slows momentum slightly, and a few template cadences ("He would be waiting. […] He would reconstitute…") flatten propulsion. No major causality breaks, but the prose could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high (heirloom detail, false-name sign-up, clinic booking compressed efficiently). However, two paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "she didn't tell them she was a euthanasia tourist, that she'd booked a slot... that she was here to learn" restates the same fact; "not because she was afraid, but because" is template phrasing. The initials discovery beat (*E.M.* → *Endings Matter*) stretches plausibility and reads as authorial nudge rather than organic find. No major figurative muddle, but "fold in patience" in the final line verges on abstraction without concrete anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well ("its taillights dissolving into the violet dusk like embers in a dying fire"), and information density is high in key beats. Two artifacts lower the score: mild figurative density in the opening third without pattern-teaching ("amber pavilion sagged under the weight of autumn's gold," "roots curling around his ankles like pleading fingers") and a paraphrase loop in paragraph nine ("She had needed motion; he, stillness. She'd sought answers in the stars; he, in the slow unfurling of a grapevine's tendril" restates the prior mismatch). No loops touch the closure beat, so accumulation cap is −0.8. Propulsion is otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, with short declaratives ("No. But I can hold it *long enough*.") breaking longer accumulative sentences. Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "her half-mask of bleached bone pressed close to her cheek, the other side bare—strangely honest" anchors object, character trait, and thematic seed). No paraphrase loops; the parapet's repeated touches are functionally distinct (press, trace, coax). Minor figurative density: "whispered," "threading," "breath through reeds," "like the first word" cluster in the opening, approaching saturation but held in check by concrete action. The line "This was how wisdom survived—not in proclamations, but in the spaces between" trends toward thematic statement but is brief and tied to immediate action (pressing forehead to parapet).

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece exhibits significant pattern-artifact density. Template cadence runs throughout: "She opened... She pressed... She closed... She smiled... She adjusted... She walked." Paraphrase loops appear frequently—"healing wasn't subtraction, but rearrangement" immediately follows "their weight had changed," restating the same concept. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh vehicle logic ("threads," "constellation," "stitches in a wound," "veins of light"). Filter-verb stacks cluster in the final third ("she knew," "she didn't look back"), dulling immediacy during the closure beat. These artifacts trigger −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Clarity is strong with no major loops. Minor issues: "the hush so profound it hummed" and "suspended quiet" are near-synonym pairings that feel ornamental. "Reticent no longer" in the penultimate paragraph reads as label-speak rather than embodied realization. The opening and closing images are vivid and charged. No major artifact or scaffold stacks, but these small slips in texture prevent higher banding.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong concrete imagery and varied syntax. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent—"fog curled through...like breath on glass," "tape...hummed like a tuning fork struck against the future"—though "tuning fork struck against the future" is a mixed vehicle (tuning forks don't strike). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. A few lines edge toward overwriting ("driftwood washed up like bones," "intentions" as a graveyard occupant) but information density remains high and the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high, with most lines advancing image or character (cameras refracting time, hand casting flickering shadows). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops in the final third: "The future was a blur" immediately after "let the current take him," and multiple restatements of the same insight (hand not broken/waiting, constancy as movement). Template cadence appears in runs of parallel constructions ("Somewhere, a leaf fell. / Somewhere, a star exploded. / And somewhere, a man...") that read as deliberate patterning but also as formulaic echo. Figurative density is high throughout without sufficient variance in peak beats, and stock metaphors ("horizon curved like the edge of a question") mix with fresher images. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for figurative saturation in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at turns, longer cadences in reflection) and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled: "hope shifted from a flame to a scent" and "clouds parted like a promise she no longer believed" are coherent and purposeful. Minor issues: "the pulsing stillness of those waiting" appears twice verbatim, creating a small loop; "radiant haven" recurs as stock phrase without fresh angle. Propulsion is strong, and the final sequence (drop, wash, pick up harp) drives cleanly to closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled ("stars pulsed like embers," "reality had folded like warm wax"). Two artifacts lower momentum: the phrase "quietly deliberate" recurs across the opening and near-ending without reweighting, and "the weight of it familiar, like a memory trying to resurface" is a stock formulation. The final third ("She had always been good at closing loops. / Now, she would learn to open them.") contains a paraphrase loop that restates the same idea across two beats without added pressure. Information density is high elsewhere, and no causality breaks occur.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and figurative language is selective (the garden as living entity, the well's symbols "like embers"). Template cadence appears in the opening paragraphs: three consecutive sentences begin with "It was" / "She slipped" / "She picked up," creating mild monotony. Minor paraphrase loop: "the garden answered" / "the well's symbols flared" / "the vines trembled" in close succession restates the same magic-trigger event without added pressure. No loops or scaffolding touch the closure beat, and information density is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high in sensory passages (grotto exhales, sea glass glows, quartz winks). Two minor loops: "reflectively vibrant" appears twice identically, and "light" recurs without fresh inflection in the final third (light that lingered, light is a language, light learned to stay). Metaphor coherence is strong except "coils of stone slick with breath of tide" strains the serpent vehicle. The "as if laughing" sea glass in the penultimate paragraph anthropomorphizes awkwardly. Overall propulsion is steady but the final paragraphs slow with stacked abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, persistent overwriting and figurative density cluster in high-pressure beats: "cathedral of moss," "skeletal arches draped in emerald velvet," "honeyed hush," "bonfire...embers," "trapped sunlight," and the final "garden held them both in its protected vulnerability." These stack metaphors without clear payoff and drift into lyric register that obscures rather than sharpens pressure. Paraphrase loop: "She wasn't hiding" followed by "That was what the comments said—coward, ghost, liar—but hiding would've been easier" restates without added detail. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with character name + past-tense verb ("Lena exhaled," "Lena laughed," "Lena smiled," "Lena reached"). Apply −0.8 for density and loops, −0.3 for template stems = −1.1 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective, but several passages overwrite at peak moments. "Each one a shape of hope, distorted by the current" is clean, but "the weight of the confession pulling him under" stacks metaphor on an already layered scene. The seashell description repeats structure: "pressed it into his palm...pressed it to his lips...pressed back into his pocket"—three near-identical stems within 800 words. "Lucidly watchful" appears twice without distinct function. The final image ("the water whispers around him...you can hear the pages turning") is evocative but borders on lyric surplus after the already-charged dissolution. Information density is high in the cameo transformations, but scaffold phrases ("One by one," "When the last sentence dried") slow momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies (short bursts during the song, longer sweeps in setup), and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language is controlled except in two spots: "liquid gold" (opening) and "rivers that ran with starlight" (backstory example) read as stock metaphors without fresh vehicle logic. The closure image is clean and propulsive. Grammar, tense, and pronoun reference remain consistent throughout. Minor deduction for mild overwriting in the cosmological epiphany line ("the slow, sure spin of the cosmos"), which slightly inflates texture without sharpening the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the crafting beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the world was ending or beginning; she didn't know which, and it didn't matter" restates without added pressure; "She had all the time in the world, and the world, for once, had none to spare" toggles rather than advances. Template cadence runs in the final third ("She would be kneeling…her hands moving…her breath curling…her patience as endless") and figurative stacking ("like smoke," "like a bridge," "like dragonfly wings," "like embers") accumulates without clear pattern-teaching. Minor clarity slip: "the starlight safe" lacks a verb.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic weight. Strong openings ("The locksmith knelt," "The cavern groaned") anchor voice. However, multiple sentences rely on repetitive template stems: "He was peripherally focused that way," "He didn't know why," "He worked faster," "He exhaled." The phrase "the thing beside the thing" and variations on "storing/stored" recur without escalating pressure. Stock metaphors appear: "ink in water," "silver from the deep," "breath curling into the cold." The final third avoids major loops, but mid-story phrasing like "not to mend but to *listen*" and "not about preservation. / It was about *access*" uses identical cadence twice. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; no mixed metaphors harm clarity. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"bronze throat blackened by soot and whispered secrets," "weights she'd gathered...thick as kelp...sharp as a misplaced chisel...light as a moth's wing"—and while vivid, the accumulation risks overwriting in peak beats where simpler syntax would sharpen propulsion. Several paraphrase loops: "She was not the weaver. She was the loom" is thematically apt but the prior paragraph already enacts that realization through "They had never truly left." Template cadence appears in repeated "The grotto [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. No major clarity breaks, but the line-level embellishment dulls momentum at the climax. Information density is strong; no scaffolding or filler. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the match striking with a sound like a lion's yawn" carries action, sensory detail, and thematic echo). A few figurative constructions risk overwriting: "minutes slowing as her fingers traced the memory of his voice" stacks metaphor on metaphor, and "steam curling into the shape of things she would never name" hovers near opacity. The "crystallized time" phrase recurs without clear mechanical grounding, a minor scaffold artifact. Opening and closing lines are strong, and the loop check is mostly clean, but the density of figurative language in peak beats (dream sequence, final carving) occasionally blurs propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: "the way it dimpled where her younger self had once stood" does setting, memory, and character work simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at the leap ("She jumped. Not to fall..."), longer lyric passages in reflective beats. Minor loop: "she collected fragments" and "scavenged their discarded things" paraphrase the same content across paragraphs two and three without added pressure (−0.2). The metaphor "heavy as the camera wheel" contradicts plastic's lightness slightly but doesn't obscure sense. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats; the closure sequence is propulsive and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The terminal shuddered, not collapsing, but *resurrecting*" conveys event, tone, and stakes). Clarity and concision are strong; no paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. One cluster of filter verbs in the hydroponics bay paragraph ("The sextant piece fit... when she slotted it home") slightly dulls immediacy but remains legible. Figurative language is purposeful (corroded steel ribs, sky the color of old bruises) and doesn't overrun the beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs cleanly. Minor syntactic repetition with "She didn't [verb]" stems appears twice but doesn't escalate to template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines do double work (the quill simile anchors character and stakes; the forecourt "glistened" and "caught the hidden sunrise" before the scribe touches it). The final paragraph's three-beat structure ("They would shake their heads... but they wouldn't hear... And if they listened...") propels to closure without loops. Deductions: "the grooves of an unfinished clock face, its gears frozen mid-motion like a breath held too long" stacks two metaphors in one line without clear propulsion (−0.3); "voices of a time before silence became his only companion" in paragraph three is a near-paraphrase of the whispers' later reveal (−0.2). The closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lyric-dense with strong imagery ("blade through old parchment," "pages spreading like lily pads") and information density is high. However, several beats loop concept without advancing pressure: "silence of a world that had moved on" / "the world's noise faded to this" restate the same isolation; "not as she was, but as she might have been: steady, unbroken" / "as she was—errant, unsteady, but no longer lost" recycle the contrast structure. The line "some things weren't meant to be found. They were meant to be let go" is a paraphrase loop across adjacent sentences. Template stems appear in the auctioneers triplet ("the first…the second…the third"). Apply −0.6 for loops and −0.3 for template cadence in non-closure beats = −0.9 total.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at key beats: "But this rope was special." "The harbor answered."), and imagery is concrete. However, several lines loop conceptually: "silent histories" / "stories knotted into husks" and "coax truths" / "decode" / "preserve" recur without added pressure. Elevated diction ("infinitely patient," "drowning dark," "oceanic breath") occasionally drifts above the POV's established lexicon during high-pressure beats (the fulgurite discovery, the final splice). Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors harm clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "sails swallowing the horizon like a sigh," "the sky was a bruise of violet and ash," "branches dragging the ground like fingers tracing a wound." While evocative, the metaphors occasionally mix registers or compete for attention, flattening momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "he would listen. He would write." and the catalog in the final third (thread as compass, obituaries as maps, garden as waiting). Several sentences in the closing section restate the same thematic content without advancing pressure. Template cadence is visible in parallel "Like the thread. / Like the tide." structures. Elevated diction persists in peak beats without clear POV motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies across beats; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual propulsion. Information density is high: "the suspended palace—anchored to the ceiling of the world by chains of black iron—had long since forgotten the sound of wings" does setting, history, and tone work simultaneously. Minor overwriting appears in clusters: "bitter-sweet ache of living," "bitter-sweet tang of rot and renewal," "bitter aftertaste of hope" repeats the same figurative gesture across paragraphs, and "quaking certainty… quaking reverie" forms a bookend that borders on template cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, and the final line propels without summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Three friction points: (1) "gracefully alert precision" stacks modifiers without clear embodiment; (2) "kelp-drift peace" recurs as atmospheric label without fresh inflection; (3) minor paraphrase loop in paragraph 8–9 restating the village's judgment and Liora's counter-knowledge. Information density is generally high. Syntax varies effectively. The "migration of clouds" motif appears three times but does not meaningfully evolve—it reads as atmospheric recurrence rather than pressure device.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence variety and rhythm accelerate cleanly through the door/chamber sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance image, choice, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language ("V-formations dissolving like a breath," "memories sharp-edged things," "threads like spider silk") is vivid and coherent, though "sticky as honey" and "stretching like taffy" both use food similes within two lines. Opening line ("geese had left the sky empty") and closing frame (geese returning, city breathes) create purposeful resonance. Grammar, tense, and pronoun reference are clean. No scaffolding or template stems. Prose propulsion is strong with no momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("stretched like a sigh," "slow gravity of forgotten stars," "each notch a memory, each rotation an approximation of infinity") without pattern-teaching or payoff in a shorter piece, triggering overwriting penalty −0.5. Template cadence in second half ("She [verb]" x6 across closure beats) adds −0.5. Paraphrase loop: "the way the nebula bloomed, faded, and bloomed again, the way their own children always returned to the same questions" restates cycle redundantly. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, others ornament. Propulsion slows mid-piece with reflective summary ("Generations before her had tried...") that could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively, with shorter beats during the chisel slip and longer passages during reflection. Some phrases lean toward elevated register: "pressure coiling around him," "veined with starlight," "constellations." The opening paragraph carries strong sensory density. Minor template patterns appear: "The carver [verb]" repeated across several paragraphs. The final two paragraphs compress multiple beats (walking to the house, dinner, the butterfly exchange, the ending epiphany) with summary phrasing ("as the butterflies returned each year, as the stone weathered") that flattens immediacy. Information density is high in the greenhouse scene but thins toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("The names weren't prayers. They were weights.") contrast with longer, layered backstory. Information density is high; most lines serve character, world, or theme. Minor scaffolding appears: "The bob began to descend, but slower now, as if dragging the past behind it" where "as if" hedges metaphor that the prior line already implies. "Dawn would come, and with it the council's outrage, their demands for the 'correct' time, as if time had ever been just numbers" slightly over-explains. No loops or template cadence. Figurative language (brass teardrop, tower squatting like a penitent) is vivid and controlled, though "the sea hissed against the ridge like a held breath released" mixes breath/hiss in ways that blur vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the knot-untangling sequence. Clarity holds throughout, with vivid specifics ("dried blood and forgotten violets," "sovereigns and promises"). However, several constructions lean toward overwriting: "the way the marigolds leaned toward certain headstones and the way the silo's door never quite latched" uses template repetition ("the way...and the way"), and "a chorus of murmurs in languages Elias didn't know but *felt*, like the pulse of roots in winter" stacks metaphor on metaphor without full coherence. The closure image is clean, but mid-scene figurative density occasionally obscures propulsion. Apply −0.6 for pattern density and register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high. Two minor issues lower the score: (1) template cadence in the middle third ("She had come… She dipped… She worked…" stems recur across four paragraphs), and (2) slight figurative density in the climax beat ("veins of silver," "flock of starlings," "swirling… settling") without pattern-teaching. Clarity holds, but the stems create a drumbeat that flattens propulsion. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and −0.2 for figurative cluster, total −0.8 from a mid-7 base.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but generally purposeful ("mist coiled through the cracked windows, thick as regret"). Information density is high; most lines advance story or atmosphere. However, patterned artifacts accumulate: "dust" recurs across ten beats without always adding new pressure, creating synonym churn around "shimmer," "whisper," "sing." The phrase "The wind carries what the mouth cannot hold" is repeated four times, twice identically, which reads as motif reinforcement but edges toward loop. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "By dawn, the phrase was scrawled... Elias was already gone... The story famine would last... But now, the dust had learned..." (four parallel declaratives in summary mode). These artifacts cluster in the closure section, dulling immediacy when scene work would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do double work (the mask's fractures both physical detail and thematic image). However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "not by preserving them, but by letting them dissolve in the right way" echoes "not by clinging, but by letting it unravel in a way that felt like choice"; "the mirage of safety" and "safety was just another mirage" restate without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the closing third: "The mask would still fit. / The fractures would still catch the light. / She would still be weaving. / The curator would still call it art." These parallel declaratives stack without variation, dulling momentum at closure. Minor register drift ("the curator would call this piece") toward art-catalog diction. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stack touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propels: short bursts in crisis ("The pumps started. The water rose. Elias didn't move.") contrast with layered reflection earlier. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Two minor issues: "a sound like a spark in damp tinder" (Veyra's exhale) is strained, and "The threat hung there, heavy as the cog" is near-cliché. The opening ("stank of old copper and newer lies") and closing (ticking cog juxtaposed with the clerk's dismissal) bracket the piece effectively. No loops or scaffolding; clarity remains high even in figurative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural cadence. Information density is high (rosette, choir history, unlearning hatred, library setting compressed efficiently). Minor scaffolding appears in adjacent lines: "They weren't a choir anymore. They were the remnants of one" is paraphrase-loop (−0.2). Figurative language is dense ("velvet library exhaled," "autumn stripped the trees," "hatred… unlearned people") but coherent and voice-motivated, though clustering risks overwriting in a reflective mode. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high but uneven—"iron ribs rusted into lace," "silence thick as rising dough," "veil between what was and what could be thinned to silk" cluster in the opening, then recede. Template cadence appears in the final third: "Some rebellions weren't loud. / Some were quiet. / Some were sweet." Paraphrase loop: "not to impress, not to rebel, but to *feed*" and "He would cook with it. / Not to impress, not to rebel…" restate intent without added pressure. Information density is strong in the seed-planting sequence but thins into summary during the Alignment's passage and dish-serving. No clarity breaks; rhythm supports atmosphere but doesn't tighten under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph cuts create visual pacing. Information density is high in the riddle and seed beats. Strong specific nouns: crow's eye, burnt sugar, copper ribs. Opening line ("hummed like a struck tuning fork") anchors voice and stakes; final line ("warm, inevitable, and wild") recharges prior material. Deductions: paraphrase loop at "The city's engineers would blame the storm, but Elias knew better" followed immediately by matchbox exposition restating the same knowledge gap. Template cadence in the crowd-reaction passage: "A child pointed. / A woman laughed." Filter-verb stack during the truth-rising moment: "The truth rose... The truth clawed... He swallowed." These patterns dull immediacy in a high-pressure beat and cluster near closure, disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, overwriting clusters appear: "the kind that lived beneath it, the kind that made a house feel like it was breathing" is a paraphrase loop. Figurative language is dense in several high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching payoff ("streetlights' daydreaming glow," "bay's sighing breeze," "breath curling...like a question"). Stock metaphor "like a cup holds light" in the penultimate insight. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues. No causality breaks but momentum sags slightly in mid-section reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; no obvious template cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance image, pressure, or revelation. Two modest issues: "tap-tap-tapping at the mortar of their convictions" is a mixed metaphor (chisel on mortar, then brick), and "the structural weakness of their certainty" abstracts a concrete telepathic action. The ampoule's stain "pulsed, as if the foxglove itself was listening" is vivid and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is strong; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Rhythm varies naturally (short beats at the rupture: "She ran." "The world tilted."). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Clarity is consistent. Minor deductions: "The rupture wasn't in the math. It was in the texture." reads as template-cadence parallelism without added pressure. Filter-verb stack in the opening third ("had been climbing," "had been," "had once tried," "had come") slightly flattens immediacy. "A anchor" is a typo. The "not upward, but sideways" and "not the theorem, but the moment" constructions repeat the same syntactic pattern within close proximity, creating mild mechanical echo.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: "the greenhouse on the rooftop was the only place...where the waxing moon could slip through the haze" does scene-setting, atmosphere, and stakes in one move. One mild paraphrase loop: "wondered if any of them still dreamed" / "if any of them lay awake" restates the insomnia motif without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language ("moon like a coin," "embers in the smog") is vivid but clusters densely in the opening third; under Accumulative lens this is permissible pattern-building. No template cadence, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Final image is propulsive and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image recharges the lens motif with the baking chorus. Information density is high across most beats. However, several paraphrase loops touch key moments: "The displaced would not be lost. / Not while the waterfall still sang, not while the ovens still breathed" restates the same content across adjacent lines without added pressure (−0.2). "One by one, the grotto's people gathered, their hands finding the old shapes" then "The bread they pulled from the ovens that dawn" recycles the gathering concept (−0.3). Filter-verb stacking ("pressed," "bit into," "heard") clusters but does not reach the ≥3-line penalty threshold in a single beat. Cumulative text-pattern debt: −0.5 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("splinter in the throat of the sea," "bruised violet of a storm's underbelly"), creating atmospheric texture but occasionally blurring propulsion in non-peak beats. Paraphrase loop: "The yoyo's string went taut…not as a leash but a lifeline" and "Its radiance had been a key, not a lock" both clarify metaphors mid-image rather than trusting the vehicle. Template cadence in the closing third: "The island exhaled. The sea forgot his name. But somewhere…" stacks short declaratives without varied rhythm. Information density is strong; no major scaffold or synonym churn. Clarity holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "lingering luminance of a thousand laughter-turned-screams," "the peeling wallpaper," "a fistful of blackened filmstrip, the negative of his own heartbeat." Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating density without always advancing pressure. Stock metaphors recur: "dawn broke like a bruise," "the air smelled of burnt sugar and copper pennies." Template cadence: "The funhouse shuddered. / The advisor's voice slithered... / The mirrors began to weep." Paraphrase loop: "letting the filmstrip unspool" is restated as "watching as the frames burned." The Loop/Scaffold Screen flags synonym churn ("resuscitation" appears four times with slight variation). Information density is high, but momentum drags under ornament. The final paragraph loops ("Lysander adjusted the clasp. / The game wasn't over. / It had only just remembered how to play") without adding new knowledge. Apply −1.2 for density/coherence overwriting and template cadence in Q7; artifacts touch but do not obscure closure, so no higher escalation. Disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked ("clouds coiled like unplayed sheet music," "fruits glowing faintly…as if lit from within by the same restless energy"). Mixed metaphors appear ("sound…bloomed like a bruise," "hand…conducting" then "clenched into a fist"). Template cadence runs: "He struck…He lifted…He didn't fight…He didn't know." Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2 (mallet description, orchard description) restates the floating-orchard concept. Artifacts touch closure paragraph ("restlessness…wasn't fear. It was the thrill"), triggering accumulation cap and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse, but several beats carry overwritten figurative density without pattern-teaching: "silhouette unspooling into threads of light," "their silence splitting into a chorus of voices not meant for human ears." The final third contains template cadence in short declarative runs ("The watchers parted... The city trembled... The expedition had never been lost") that flatten propulsion at closure. Minor paraphrase loop: "The watchers were no longer on the horizon. / They were at the edge of the city" restates position without added pressure. Deductions: density without payoff −0.5, template cadence in closure third −0.6, paraphrase loop −0.2; total −1.3, capping at 6.9 per artifact-in-closure-third disallow-9+ rule.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "ivy strangled the iron bones," "thick as the mildew climbing," "light as a promise, heavy as a key." Mixed metaphor: the **B** "catching light like a held breath" confuses vehicle and tenor. Template cadence in the opening (three "he [verb]" constructions) and paraphrase loop ("The lie had been noble" echoes "noble lies" without added detail). Information density is high in the document-reveal beat, but figurative density in the final third slows momentum. No major causality breaks, so penalties stay in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high: most sentences layer action, atmosphere, and character motive. Figurative language clusters heavily—"wound," "whisper," "bones of the city," "hushed blaze," "archeologist of abandoned dreams"—without always earning specificity; some metaphors (cracks as whispers, notes as conversations) border on stock. Template cadence appears: "He had been hired… He didn't know… He wondered… He had three more…" runs of identical stems. No paraphrase loops, but the elevated diction ("interlaced absence," "wrest meaning") occasionally obscures rather than sharpens. Propulsion remains steady; no major momentum stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively; opening lines establish voice and stakes. Information density is high in the discovery sequence. However, several loops and scaffolds reduce momentum: "The blackout had" opens two paragraphs; "His motivation wasn't curiosity; it was deeper" is a hedge that the next line contradicts; "exhaled, the sound lost in the vast quiet" is functionally repeated by "leaving the chamber as he'd found it—undisturbed, but no longer silent." The phrase "His hands didn't tremble" is unnecessary self-commentary. Stock metaphor: "like a talisman." Template cadence in the final third: multiple "They called him" / "And he never told them" / "Some stillness" constructions create a mechanical rhythm. These artifacts appear in the closure section, lowering the score and disqualifying 9+ globally per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines advance image, action, or interiority simultaneously (e.g., "The gem thrummed in her palm as she pressed it into the basilica's central pillar, where the glass was thinnest, where the dreams bled together like watercolors in the rain"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, with occasional register drift: "surgical severing" and "luminous and white-hot" edge toward elevated diction that tensions the maker's artisan voice. Two paraphrase loops: "She had built the glass basilica to record the dreams of the dead" and "The lanterns she crafted were not for light, but for *recording*" restate the same premise across paragraphs without new pressure, triggering a −0.2 deduction. A template-cadence run appears in the tea-garden sequence: "Now it was... / She polished... / The shadow had... / That was when..." (four consecutive past-tense openers with similar stems), adding −0.4. The metaphor "dreams bled together like watercolors in the rain" is vivid, but "the dreams of the dead coiled and unspooled, threading through the air like silk, like the last exhale of a drowning man" stacks three vehicles (coil/silk/exhale) in quick succession, briefly muddling the image. No loops or scaffold touch the closure beat, limiting cumulative penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, especially at the climax. Two minor loop artifacts: "Lena smiled. For the first time since the strike, she wasn't a survivor. She was the perturbation" recycles structure across three beats without added pressure (−0.3), and "the geode pulsed…warm now, as if the storm outside had seeped into its core" uses filter-adjacent phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy (−0.2). Figurative language ("a knife," "lattice of bright threads") is coherent and sparse. No grammar errors; spatial choreography (dome, console, intercom, darkness) tracks cleanly. The final line "stepped into the dark, hunting" is concrete and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; imagery is vivid ("last sliver of sun bled," "indigo bruise of the sky"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "missing pieces weren't screaming" / "the missing piece" / "Some missing pieces weren't meant to be kept" cycles the motif without adding pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "She didn't tell him her name. / She didn't need to. / The stars did the talking. / And for the first time…" stacks parallel refusals that dull momentum. Figurative density is high without muddle, but the loops and template runs in the closure zone trigger artifact penalties and disallow 9+ globally per the rule.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. The opening ("cobalt terrace stretched like a bruise") and closing images charge the arc. However, several adjacent sentences loop conceptually: "He'd told himself it wasn't his fault. / He'd told himself that for seven years" is near-paraphrase, and "the way he did when a client's grief threatened to unravel the fiction he'd sold them. / But this time, the quiet wasn't for them" restates the pivot. Two instances of figurative density in the climactic beat ("tiles suddenly felt too bright," "breath came shallow," "paper trembled," "bell tolled") risk slight overwriting, though the effect remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled except in one cluster: "mist that curled like ghostly fingers," "moon hung at half-mast," "phase synchronizing with the tide of their patience"—three metaphors in quick succession at the opening negotiation beat, mixing vehicles (ghost/nautical/tidal) without clear pattern payoff. Template cadence appears in the mid-section: "He slid it toward her. … Her fingers twitched. … 'No,' Elias said." Paraphrase loop: "something quieter had won" echoes "the furrowed hush" within two lines. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum at a pivotal turn, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "wasn't for the sea anymore; it was a relic" restates in the next beat, and "counting poles" recurs without added pressure. Minor overwriting in "the hollow in his chest" followed shortly by "weight in his chest lighter than it had been in years" creates a metaphor muddle. The final third avoids major artifacts, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies (−0.8 total for loops and metaphor inconsistency). Sentence variety is strong and opening/closing lines anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates rhythmic control and vivid imagery ("veins pulse beneath skin," "tunnel's throat"), but several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops (empathy regrowth mentioned clinic/ribs/lake), figurative density in non-peak beats ("mirror of bioluminescent veins pulsing"), and template stems ("The needle left," "The clinic had promised," "The map wasn't"). The lake scene's lyricism ("water *parted*—not with a splash, but a sigh") charges the moment but risks overwriting. No major clarity breaks, but momentum occasionally stalls in descriptive layering. Line-level craft is competent with minor slips that don't touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Figurative language is dense ("petals unfurling like secrets," "hollow so vast it had its own gravity," "edges blurring like ink in rain") and occasionally stacks without breathing room—three metaphors in the opening sentence risk overwriting. The phrase "crushed saffron" / "crushed vanilla" / "ground nutmeg" creates a template cadence across conjuring beats. No paraphrase loops, but the penultimate paragraph's "too porous, too willing to bleed" reads as slight exposition where image could carry the weight. Propulsion remains clear; closure image is vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well with lyric fragments ("Like a benediction. / Like a beginning.") and the prose carries high information density in most beats. However, two adjacent sentences near climax loop conceptually: "She understood then: the glade was a reservoir. / All the seconds she'd spent staring... had gathered here" restates the same realization without added pressure (−0.2). The three-part unfastening list reads slightly mechanical, and "choking beauty" appears in elevated metaphor ("breath... like a forgotten breath") that occasionally blurs clarity under pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs, and the propulsion remains strong through most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language ("ship of bones," "thread was her own breath") charges atmosphere. However, minor loops appear: "the tear" is named repeatedly without variation, and several beats recycle "Lien + verb" stems. The final third accelerates cleanly. Information density is high in the stitching sequence, but some scaffold phrasing ("for the first time in three hundred years," "for the first time in forever") dulls momentum slightly. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short fragments punctuate longer lyric sentences), and information density is high—most lines advance image, action, or atmosphere. A few near-duplicates appear: "the whispering hush" is named three times without evolving its referent, and "texture of transformation" recurs as a label rather than accumulating specificity. The metaphor "lava kiss the sea" is vivid, but "older, wiser, saying *Yes. Like this.*" in the chorus of voices feels like a stock epiphany phrase. No major loops or template cadence runs harm closure, and clarity remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and sentences advance pressure cleanly through most beats. Strong images: "lantern left burning too long," "lock yielding to a calmly inventive hand," "tombstone" armory door. However, paraphrase loops appear ("Coincidence? Kael's lips twitched. He'd spent months ensuring it wasn't" restates the engineered blackout already established), and stock metaphors ("heart hardening like steel," "hungry and bright") cluster without fresh specificity. Template cadence in the armory sequence ("One wrong twist... One slip...") flattens propulsion. The final third's elevated diction ("Veythar's light was back. But the world had changed") reads as summary rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("tide had stolen the friction," "aurora pulsed like a dying heartbeat," "eels...slipping through her nets like smoke"). Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent beats ("The dust at her feet shivered. / Liora exhaled, slow and deliberate, and reached for it" → "grains were heavier than they should've been, warm as a pulse" restates tactile discovery without advancing), and mixed metaphor in "paint flaking like dead skin" clashes with the cosmic/elemental register. Template cadence: "She pressed...She didn't know...She would place" creates stem repetition across closure beats. Clarity remains high; no scaffold obscures causality, but density occasionally tips toward overwriting in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence variety is strong, with complex syntax during reflection and shorter declaratives at turns. However, repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "He didn't watch them fall. / He didn't look back. / He didn't need to..." stacks refusals without propulsion. Figurative density is high throughout ("atlas of wounds," "ship adrift in sky turned ocean," "clouds unraveling like censored line") without clear payoff at closure; mixed metaphors (observatory as ship, sky as ocean, clouds as text) blur rather than sharpen. Several scaffold sentences restate content: "This was the vigil in pause: the moment between..." paraphrases the concept without advancing pressure. The final paragraph's explanatory summary ("And somewhere, between the clouds...") over-tells the thematic resolution. Apply −0.6 for template repetition and figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; compound images ("surface catching the late afternoon light like shattered diamonds") create texture without obscuring action. However, density slips with paraphrase loops: "the atrium held its breath—the brook, the heron, even the dappled light" restates the same suspension without added pressure. "Lunging forward not with his blade but with the flat of his mechanical palm" stacks negation and clarification where a direct verb would propel. Template cadence in the final third ("Elias took it… Liora adjusted… Elias grinned") flattens momentum approaching closure. No grammar breaks; clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and sentences mostly multi-task (e.g., "its false bottom hiding not coins but brittle pages" advances object, motive, and history in one breath). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines bracket well. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "rebuild…rebuilding" across three paragraphs, "bloom" recurring four times without pattern-teaching, and synonym churn ("molted," "molt," "molting") that restates rather than advances. The phrase "luminous thing, held together by hands" in mid-story and "planting something fiercer than fire" at the end both gesture at the same concept without fresh pressure. Template cadence in the final third ("By dawn…And if…He tucked…") flattens propulsion. Apply −0.8 for loop/scaffold density touching the closure neighborhood.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high (most lines advance setting, character, or pressure). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "compasses flickered like dying fireflies," "music stretched behind her like a wake," "horizon was swallowing the sun." Two issues lower the score: (1) mild overwriting in the middle ("The footage was old—grainy images… But Lena had spliced in something new: frames of a path, revealed only when the light hit the celluloid just right") stacks modifiers without clear propulsion, and (2) near-paraphrase loop in "The compasses in her pocket shuddered, their needles locking in unison" followed two lines later by "The compasses in her pocket stilled, their needles pointing inward"—synonym churn without added pressure. Sentence openings vary; no grammar errors. The Loop/Scaffold penalty (−0.4) and mild density slip keep this below 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong images (twilight-colored seed, violet-stained teeth, mud at dawn). Sentence rhythm varies and most lines advance story or atmosphere. However, the piece shows several patterns: filter-verb stacks ("could already feel," "should have terrified"), template stems ("The X was Y" pattern repeats: "The seeds were dangerous," "The problem was," "The cost was"), and near-paraphrase loops (the monsoon's coming is restated three times in the opening section). The figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "slow heartbeats" for pulsing seeds works, though "tapestry of collective memory" is stock. The closure image is strong, but the preceding paragraph leans into summary ("The island would forget her name eventually") rather than holding the dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the compass-decoding sequence. However, several lines overwrite or loop: "the horizon was no longer a wound. It was just the place where the sky remembered the water" is lovely but slows momentum without adding pressure. The final two paragraphs repeat the resolution ("lighter," "keep coming," "move through him") in slightly different phrasings, creating a paraphrase loop. Stock metaphor "wound" for horizon and "fingers through a lover's hair" in the opener are minor but noticeable. The figurative density is highest in reflective beats, not peak action, so the overwriting cap remains modest.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: vivid metaphors, high information density, and little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Phrases like “the dust preprocessed reality” and “the dust would remember the shape of the falling” are striking without becoming incoherent. There is a mild tendency toward abstraction and repeated conceptual phrasing near the end, but it doesn’t materially blur the closure image. Overall, rhythm and clarity are well-controlled and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are generally clean, specific, and multi-functional (frost as script, ledger as “molten tears” of her work). Sentences do more than one job—advancing mood, theme, and character simultaneously—and there are few, if any, true scaffolding lines. However, metaphor density is high and occasionally risks redundancy or over-explicitness, especially in the latter third where thematic statements cluster. Trimming a handful of explanatory phrases would heighten the impact of the strongest images.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentence rhythms vary, almost every sentence pulls double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or action plus theme), and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. The figurative language is dense but largely coherent and thematically aligned with sound and freezing/melting; it rarely feels mixed or indulgent. Momentum is strong for a lyric piece—no major stalls, and transitions between reflection and action are clean. A touch more spareness in one or two high-intensity paragraphs could sharpen impact, but current density does not materially obscure meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with little scaffolding or repetition, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Metaphors are generally apt and coherent, with only rare hints of potential overload that don’t obscure sense (“biting through his coat like teeth,” “trapped scream”). Rhythm varies; paragraphing supports momentum from quiet opening to lighthouse climax to settled coda. There’s minimal redundancy or template cadence, and no technical or clarity errors that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is tight, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffold or redundancy, with many lines doing double duty for character, setting, and theme. Figurative language (“like water wearing down stone,” “thorns sharp as promises”) is vivid and controlled rather than overstacked. Paragraphing and sentence length modulate well between summary and high-pressure beats. A mild tendency toward sententia in the final third slightly blunts the rawness of the climax but doesn’t significantly harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing image and theme), and the metaphors are coherent with the established visual and tactile palette (breath as thread, embers as unused love). There is some density of figurative language, but it feels patterned and purposeful rather than ornamental, and momentum is maintained across the paragraph blocks. Repetition (“here is where the unused love goes”) functions as motif rather than looped scaffolding, and there are no evident syntactic or clarity errors. A touch of purple excess in places keeps it from absolute top-tier, but it remains highly publishable on the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, generally efficient, and multi-tasking (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority at once). Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined, with a clear pattern (time as fabric, the maze as needle, photographs as threads) rather than indiscriminate ornament. There is minor risk of overload in places—terms like “texture,” “hyperbolic geometry,” and “unfolding” recur enough to brush purple—but they remain legible and thematically apt. No significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony interfere with propulsion or obscure the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, with high information density and purposeful repetition (“Not with… but with…”; “It twisted. It waited. It won.”) used for emphasis. Imagery is vivid yet controlled (keys “yellowed like old bones”; wall as “a jagged scar of concrete and rust”) and rarely lapses into purple. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or clarity issues; every paragraph advances either plot, character, or atmosphere. The slight overtness of some closing phrases is thematic rather than a structural prose flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, images are largely fresh, and nearly every line carries multiple functions (advancing image, mood, and theme simultaneously). Metaphors such as “a bruise of indigo, the color of a promise kept too long” and “humming in a frequency just below grief” feel specific and apt. There is a slight risk of over-saturation since many sentences carry metaphorical weight, but clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no evident loops or scaffolding artifacts. Trimming a handful of figurative phrases might sharpen the impact further, but as-is the prose reads publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally high-caliber: vivid images, efficient embedding of worldbuilding in action, and a satisfying cadence to both opening and closing lines. Information density is strong; most sentences are doing at least two jobs (world, mood, or theme plus plot/character). There is some tendency toward stacked metaphors and reiterated formulations about light, moments, and memory that risk mild over-saturation, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No major loops or structural scaffolds drag the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with images that usually multitask (e.g., the cracked bookmark as both reproach and record). Sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum despite the reflective mode, and there are no major loops or confusing metaphors. At times the figurative language runs a touch thick in non-peak beats, which modestly risks over-lyricism, but clarity and propulsion remain intact through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled and evocative, with metaphors that mostly feel precise and earned (“iron shelves sagging like old bones,” “clawed at her ribs like a trapped thing”). Sentences carry multiple functions—world-building, emotion, and forward motion—with little scaffolding or redundancy. There is a slight tilt toward lyricism and a couple of quasi-quotable maxims in the final paragraph, but they don’t obscure clarity or momentum. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to keep the rhythm lively without drawing attention to themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is lush yet controlled; metaphors are apt (“like the aftertaste of a struck bell”) and thematically aligned rather than decorative. There’s high information density: most sentences do at least two jobs (setting, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding, repetition, or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but pattern-taught from the opening and supports the accumulative mode rather than obscuring sense. Minor risk of over-richness never tips into muddle, and the final images land clean and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong, with a good balance of concrete image and conceptual language; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious slack. Repetition is patterned rather than accidental (e.g., iterative returns to violin, courtyard, second chance), and there are few if any paraphrase loops. A handful of phrases risk mild purple or abstraction, but they don’t obscure sense or dilute the closure image. The final lines in particular are clean, precise, and rhythmically satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, image-rich, and typically do more than one job (advancing mood, character, and theme together). Repetition of structures like “Not words. / Not lies.” and “Some things didn’t need fixing. / Some things only needed to be seen.” functions as intentional patterning rather than accidental looping. Figurative language is consistent with the refracted-light motif and rarely overextended, and there are no syntactic glitches or clarity issues. The only minor limitation is that the density of lyricism remains uniformly high, leaving little space for a sharper, contrasting texture under moments of peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “cracks gleamed like veins of silver” and “scattered it like shattered promises” are vivid without becoming incoherent. Most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing action while sustaining mood—and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose occasionally trends toward the sentimental or thematically explicit, but without losing precision or momentum. Rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (e.g., “organisms that didn’t so much wake as unfold from stasis”). There’s strong information density and very little scaffolding; most sentences either advance the scene or deepen motif. Repetition of short, emphatic fragments (“Not dead. Elsewhen.”) and image echoes (wings, twilight, breath) feels deliberate rather than like a loop artifact. A few metaphorical choices verge on familiar (“the moment before a first flight”), but they’re well placed and don’t blur clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: metaphor is generally fresh and coherent (“throat holding a scream it could never voice,” “water resisting him like a held note”), and most sentences do multiple jobs. There is some density of figurative language, but it feels purposeful and pattern-driven rather than purple for its own sake. No meaningful scaffold, repetition loops, or syntactic monotony impede momentum or clarity. The closing cadence is especially well-judged, tapering into a calm, charged image without slackness.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences carry multiple functions (image, character, theme) and the rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous lines and sharper beats. Figurative language is generally precise and non-redundant—the mountain as “half-healed scar,” the paper “soft as a pulse,” truths as things to be swallowed—and sound/flow pass the read-aloud test. There is some recurrence of key abstractions (truth, certainty, margins) that could be trimmed or grounded a touch more in fresh images, but it doesn’t meaningfully drag momentum or blur sense. Grammar, sequencing, and pronoun clarity are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) and the prose reads aloud with varied rhythm. Figurative language is frequent but usually sharp and coherent (“brass surface pitted like a molared jaw”; “voice cracked like thin ice over a lie”), avoiding mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and transitions between images maintain momentum rather than bog it down. The only limitation is that the density of metaphor occasionally risks drawing attention to itself instead of the underlying emotional beat, keeping this just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and intentional: images like “catacombs of lost knowledge,” “river sighed,” and “time drifted like a leaf on the current” are vivid without being incoherent. Figurative density is high but mostly well-managed; metaphors are thematically aligned and rarely feel mixed or overstrained. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum in a meditative piece. Any hint of purple is offset by clarity at key structural beats and a strong final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: high information density, vivid images, and minimal scaffolding, with most sentences doing double duty for character and mood. Metaphors are usually precise and rooted in the story’s motifs (breath, roots, music, light), and rhythm reads well aloud. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“ordinary magic,” “be heard”) and occasional near-platitudinous phrasing, especially in the last paragraph. These minor lapses slightly blunt the edge of an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but, for the most part, carefully chosen and non-muddled; images like “bronze quiet hum” and “threads thrummed—a resonance just below hearing” feel precise rather than purple. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism, with almost every line doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Only the high density of metaphor in a few stretches slightly risks saturation, keeping this just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are economical yet layered, images like “the beam sliced through the dark like a blade” and “the smoke curling like the question marks in his fortunes” are vivid and apt, and there is little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and patterned (especially via the fortune brackets) rather than purple, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. A few aphoristic fortunes come close to feeling generic, but they do not blunt the closure image or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without bogging down. Repetitions like “This time…” and the closing pattern around silence read as intentional rhythmic devices, not scaffolding. There is occasional risk of purple prose and one typo (“plumbbed”), but clarity and momentum mostly hold even under heavy metaphor. Figurative language stays within a consistent imagistic field (silence, color, breath) and doesn’t collapse into mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush but generally precise; most images carry multiple loads at once (e.g., the shell’s fracture, the lake’s “jagged reflections,” the sewing machine’s “chuk-chuk-chuk” as metronome of childhood). Sentence rhythm and paragraphing are well-controlled, with no significant scaffolding, repetition, or muddled metaphors. There is a high density of figurative language, but the pattern is taught early and sustained, so it reads as intentional lyricism rather than purple drift. A few lines flirt with over-ornamentation, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal padding, and metaphors are clear and non-contradictory. Figurative density is high but controlled; motifs of weight, light, and temporal fracture recur in purposeful ways rather than as ornament. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences, and syntax varies enough to avoid monotony. A few abstractions (“labyrinth of self,” “conceptual reconfiguration” equivalents) slightly blunt immediacy, but they don’t materially harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is finely tuned: metaphors are apt (“drumheads… like a held breath”; grooves “spiraling inward like a secret”) and rarely stack to the point of clutter. Sentences often perform multiple functions at once (advancing setting, character, and theme), and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Rhythm adjusts well between denser atmospheric lines and cleaner, declarative moments at key turns. A few phrases approach a lyric density that could, in a longer piece, risk overload, but here they remain controlled and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Imagery is mostly sharp and coherent (“wings rustling like pages of a book left open in the rain,” “words settled in his ribs like a second heartbeat”), with very few mixed or strained metaphors. Momentum is well managed for a quiet piece; description rarely stalls the scene. The overall lushness risks approaching purple in places, but not enough to impede clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, lean, and typically do double-duty for atmosphere and character, with metaphors that are vivid but controlled ("scent hit him like a blade," "each mile a breath between what had been and what might yet be"). There’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn, and information density stays high without feeling crowded. A few phrases ("smell of remembering," "some doors, once opened, shouldn’t stay that way") brush up against familiar formulations, but they are supported by fresh context and imagery. Rhythm carries momentum cleanly through the climax and into a resonant, unhurried ending.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with metaphors (rope as time-thread, sky as sieve) generally coherent and additive. Repetition (pattern, texture, impossible choices) is purposeful rather than looped, and there’s minimal scaffolding or synonym churn. The prose walks close to the edge of lushness but usually grounds each figurative move in tactile detail, so momentum doesn’t stall. A minor cap comes from a few lines that verge on abstraction layering (“the pattern beneath the pattern”) without new concrete purchase.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences tend to do double duty with image and emotion, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful (“cathedral of silence,” shipwreck ribs, ghosts of notes), and it doesn’t swamp clarity. Information density is high without obvious bloat or confusion, and the final paragraph is clean and impactful. A few metaphors edge toward familiar lyricism, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished: strong verbs, vivid metaphors, and compact sentences that usually do multiple jobs at once. Repetition is mostly purposeful (e.g., “professionally thorough,” recurring static and amber imagery), and there are no real scaffold loops or clarity issues. At times the density of figurative language comes close to purple, especially with multiple similes in close proximity, which slightly blurs sharpness. Still, rhythm, clarity, and momentum are well maintained, with no artifacts that harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are lean, purposive, and often multitask (setting, character, and theme in one move) without padding. There’s some familiar phrasing (“the real music… in the spaces between the notes”) but it lands as earned rather than purple or clichéd in context. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle slow momentum; grammar and sequencing are clean. The prose feels publication-ready with only minor potential tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied and musical, images are fresh (“fruit that refracts light into stories no one alive could read”), and there’s high information density without bloat. Figurative language is frequent but not purple; images are coherent with the world’s logic and thematics, and there are no evident synonym loops or scaffolding artifacts. The final paragraphs land with strong rhythm and charged callbacks (hands, hum, lost languages as invitation). One could argue for editing a couple of abstract sentences in the last block, but they don’t significantly sap momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and rhythmic, metaphors are mostly precise and apt (“waters black and slow as ink,” “teeth sharp as a clock’s hands”), and almost every line carries either worldbuilding or emotional charge. The prose leans lush but rarely tips into purple; figurative language is dense yet coherent, and there are no visible loops or scaffolding sentences. Information density is high without sacrificing momentum, and the closing cadence (“There was still work to do… the echoes—well. They were only just beginning to speak.”) lands cleanly. A few images feel familiar (giant-as-city bones) but are executed with enough specificity to avoid cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: images such as “the last drop fell from the stalactites, a slow, silver pulse in the dark” and “colors that existed only in the space between missing and found” are vivid without becoming incoherent. Figurative language recurs but maintains a consistent conceptual field (math, preservation, light, sound) rather than mixing vehicles haphazardly. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. A couple of abstractions (“the quiet mathematics of the possible”) flirt with grandness but remain anchored enough in prior images not to blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, description doubles as mood and characterization, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is vivid but controlled, with color motifs (cobalt, amethyst, sapphire) and hum/silence contrasts forming a coherent pattern rather than purple excess. Information density is high—almost every line either advances action, deepens character, or sharpens atmosphere—and the prose accelerates appropriately through the tape/photo beats into the closing key handoff. No significant artifacts or loops interfere with clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“like a living tapestry,” “like a seed splitting open”) that generally pulls multiple weights—character, atmosphere, and theme. Line-level rhythm and variation are good; there is little scaffolding or redundancy, and key turns are shown rather than summarized. Metaphoric density is high but coherent; it rarely clutters sense or momentum. Minor moments of near-platitudinous phrasing are present but do not materially dull the closing image’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, image-rich, and purposeful; most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing action, revealing character, and maintaining mood). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled, and rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from sounding mechanically lyrical. There’s little to no scaffold or repetition; transitions are efficient. A slight density of imagery in the cavern-vision sequence keeps this just shy of the absolute top tier, but it never tips into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: vivid metaphors, generally tight syntax, and minimal redundancy; most sentences do more than one job (image, mood, and theme at once). Some phrases verge on purple or overdetermined metaphor (“brightest darkness,” “starlight trapped in tar”), and the final paragraphs stack abstractions that slightly dilute sharpness. Nonetheless, clarity is never lost, and the cadence of the ending lines works well aloud. With a light trim of the most declarative or lush phrases, this would be elite-level prose.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character—and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are generally apt and thematically aligned (books, breath, tides, silence as substance), and the rhythm reads smoothly aloud. There is a mild tendency toward lushness, but it rarely clogs clarity or momentum, and the story smartly eases off at decisive beats (“He tossed it to her”). Line-level craft supports rather than competes with the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) with relatively little redundancy. The imagery is dense but mostly coherent and not so stacked as to become purple or obscure causality. A few phrases edge toward abstraction or repetition of already-implied insights, yet they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image. Overall, rhythm, clarity, and concision are at a publishable level for a lyrical short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, generally clean syntax, and recurring images that evolve (tile, song, tower, tide pools) rather than merely repeat. The prose occasionally leans toward aphoristic or near-redundant formulations, especially in the final third, which slightly dulls momentum. Nonetheless, figurative language is mostly precise and non-muddled, and most sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and character. Trimming one or two explicit “lesson” sentences would let the strongest images and cadences carry more unencumbered weight.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, and most metaphors are fresh and coherent with the world’s logic (“a crack…not a sound but a concept”). The prose is dense with figurative language but, for the most part, that density is patterned and purposeful rather than gratuitous. There are a few spots of mild purple or redundancy (“It was cursed, of course” followed by re-describing the curse) that could be tightened. Momentum holds throughout, and the final images land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double duty (advancing plot while deepening theme or atmosphere). Figurative language is vivid but mostly disciplined (“ink…swirling when she tilted the pot like it was alive”; “silver darkening like a bruise”), and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The rhythm tightens appropriately around key beats (the girl’s entrance, the shattering pot, the escape) without devolving into choppiness or purple prose. A few thematic lines verge on being slightly on-the-nose, but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and musical, with strong sentence-level rhythm and high information density—most lines advance both atmosphere and character. Metaphors are generally apt and concrete, and there’s little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping. At times the density of figurative language and repetition of certain conceptual moves (textures, hum, gilding) edges toward purple, slightly risking saturation in such a short space. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are lean yet layered, metaphors are coherent and apt (“time into something thick and syrupy,” “language of rust”), and there is minimal redundancy. Rhythm varies smoothly between longer, lyrical lines and shorter, declarative ones, especially near the end. Figurative density is elevated but largely purposeful and never so stacked as to blur sense or momentum. I see no major artifacts or loops that dull the closure image, making this very strong at the sentence scale.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and the rhythm varies effectively between longer, lush lines and sharper beats. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent and not so stacked that it muddies sense; key images (shell, pages, hum) repeat purposefully rather than redundantly. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and the final third remains clear and charged. At times the prose edges toward purple, but it remains controlled enough that momentum is not meaningfully harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, metaphors are mostly clean, and many lines do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or image plus character). Pacing is tight with little scaffolding; exposition is woven into action (“Lumina’s resistance didn’t march; it reorganized”) rather than stopping it. There are a few slightly overt thematic formulations and italics, but no real loops, muddled metaphors, or rhythm glitches. The prose is publication-ready with only minor tightening possible for ultra-elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clean, varied in rhythm, and dense with meaning (“each step kicking up ghosts of light” is both visual and thematic). Information is economical, with only occasional near-redundancies or slightly generic abstractions (“a world that would never know what it had lost”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so piled-on as to muddy clarity. The final images are clear and charged, though a further trimming of a few explanatory phrases could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is tight, musical, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and narrative progression (“The water told him what the mist obscured…” is emblematic of this efficiency). Figurative language is vivid yet largely restrained and coherent, avoiding metaphor pile-ups or loops. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the final image of the wake splitting the mist dovetails cleanly with earlier sensory motifs. Any hint of purple is minor and doesn’t impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level writing is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, metaphors are coherent and rooted in water/cartography, and there is minimal redundancy. Phrases like “water remembered its own creation” and “quiet catastrophe” feel precise rather than purple, and most lines carry more than one function (atmosphere + theme + character). Figurative density is high but not chaotic, and the climax remains clear even as the water “unfolds” and speaks. There are no obvious scaffolding sentences or loops, just a couple of spots where abstraction slightly outpaces visceral grounding, which keeps this short of absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are concise yet layered, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is consistent and coherent—sound as touch and memory, the town as a body or skeleton—and avoids mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies intelligently, using longer, lusher lines to build mood and tighter phrasing to mark shifts like the archway’s groan or the town’s exhalation. Any repetition (e.g., of rhythm and resonance) reads pattern-driven rather than as an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are mostly precise, multiduty, and avoid redundancy; nearly every sentence advances mood, character, or situation. The prose balances density and momentum, especially in the middle stretch where the hush gathers and Elias appears. There is a high ratio of figurative language, but metaphors tend to cohere around water, light, and fabric rather than clashing. A touch of over-lushness in places (“time itself thinned like frayed silk,” “a sigh of stone, of centuries holding breath”) might be trimmed for elite venues but does not materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is strikingly strong line-to-line, with high information density and minimal scaffold; most sentences carry atmosphere, character, and worldbuilding at once. Figurative language is abundant but rarely feels mixed or overwrought, and it stays thematically coherent (light, breath, voice, reef/teeth). Momentum is maintained even in lyric passages, and there’s no evident synonym-churn or redundant paraphrasing. The closing cadence is particularly well-judged, landing clean, memorable images without explanatory afterthoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do double duty for mood and meaning. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and self-consistent; images like “a slash of dawn like a wound healing backward” are striking without derailing clarity. There’s little scaffold or paraphrase looping—the prose keeps advancing the scene rather than circling it. A few stacked metaphors lightly flirt with purple, but they don’t materially obscure cause/effect or the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—many lines do double duty for character, world, and theme. Metaphor and imagery are generally precise (“labyrinth wasn’t a maze. / It was a loom.”), and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. However, figurative language is frequent enough that it sometimes skirts purple, and a few phrases (“world of crumbling precedent,” “poetic weaver of broken precedents”) lean toward self-consciousness. At a top-tier venue, some tightening of metaphor density would likely be requested.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are sharp, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is cohesive (roots, breath, journeys, light) rather than scattershot, and there’s little to no paraphrase-loop or scaffolding. A handful of phrases flirt with the familiar (“as if the catacombs themselves had been holding their breath”), but they’re buoyed by surrounding specificity. Momentum remains intact despite the lyric density, and grammar and clarity are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are frequent but mostly controlled and thematically coherent (ghosts, static, margins) rather than decorative noise. A few phrases flirt with purple (“the future always felt like something you could almost touch if you reached just right”), but they don’t impede clarity or momentum. The final cadence is well-judged, with the “ding” buttoning the scene without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally excellent: high information density, strong verbs, and layered metaphors that mostly cohere around textiles, astronomy, and narrative. There is a lot of figurative language, but it’s pattern-consistent rather than random; it supports the accumulative, mythic texture. A few moments flirt with overstatement or platitude (“The stars already knew,” “stories stop everything”), and the relentless lyricism occasionally smooths over visceral immediacy. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there’s little in the way of scaffold, redundancy, or syntax monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, vivid concrete nouns, and metaphors that are generally coherent and reinforcing rather than mixed (“water like lace,” “paper soft as a pulse”). Sentences often do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and emotional stakes, and paragraphing creates a pleasing visual and rhythmic cadence. The piece leans heavily on figurative language, which flirts with purple in places, and a few lines paraphrase sentiment already implied, but these do not materially obscure action or closure. There are no noticeable grammatical or sequencing slips.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are precise, multi-tasking, and the rhythm varies enough to keep momentum through a largely interior piece. Metaphoric density is high but seldom muddled; coral, radios, and mist form a coherent figurative set rather than a grab-bag. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding lines, and syntax remains clear even in more ornate passages. The only drag on a higher score is occasional near-purple stacking where two or three rich metaphors cluster without additional pressure, risking slight saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, musical, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme without bloat. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined; metaphors generally cohere and align with the visual/light motif rather than turning purple. Redundancy is minimal, with very few paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases, and the prose sustains momentum despite its contemplative tone. A slight tendency toward similar sentence shapes in a few mid-paragraph stretches is the only minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level writing is strong: images like “a flower made of sound” and “the pause between question and reply” are striking yet clear, and most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and theme at once). Rhythm varies nicely between short emphatic lines and longer, winding ones, which suits the accumulative, incantatory feel. There is some density of metaphor and syntactic parallelism, but it reads as intentional patterning rather than uncontrolled purple prose or scaffolding; no major loops or muddled comparisons blunt the closure. Minor redundancies (“The garden is always waiting. / The door is never locked.”) are rhetorically motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in rhythm and length, metaphors are mostly sharp and apt (“feeding their thoughts into the mandatory Neural Ledgers like coins into a toll booth”), and there’s high information density with little scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, seldom tipping into purple or muddled comparison. Syntax is clean, with clear sequencing and no noticeable grammatical or pronoun errors. The only restraint is that the lushness is fairly uniform across beats, rather than tightening further at the story’s sharpest pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, with high information density and images that typically do multiple jobs at once (e.g., “the first fragile buds of coral” in the ghost’s helmet folding setting, theme, and character into one stroke). Rhythm varies well between long lyric lines and sharper, declarative pivots like “Not a eulogy. / A manual.” Metaphor is abundant but controlled and internally coherent; there are no significant mixed or baffling images that blunt the ending. Minor risk of ornamental excess in a few lines keeps it a notch below absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is strong, dense, and largely precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world, mood, and character all at once). However, figurative language is stacked heavily—nearly every line carries a metaphor or heightened image—which edges toward purple and risks desensitizing the reader (“foxglove regret,” “museum of extinct feelings,” “shattered rainbows,” etc.). Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact; there are no paraphrase loops or syntactic artifacts that obscure causality. A slight dialing back of ornament in peak beats would push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rich and image-dense yet mostly precise; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and meaning (“The archive wasn’t a tomb—it was a loom” is both metaphor and plot revelation). Rhythm varies effectively, and there are few if any genuine clarity issues. The main limitation at this level is a mild tendency toward accumulation of aphoristic lines in the final third, which risks slight redundancy and sentimentality. Trimming 1–2 of the explicit thematic statements would sharpen impact and keep the lyricism from verging on over-written.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and economical, with images that are vivid yet controlled (“stone seats sagging like the breath of some slumbering beast,” glue as a “language”) and rarely feel redundant or over-wrought. Sentences typically do multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening character, and reinforcing motif—with good rhythmic variation. There are minor intensifier phrases (“not from fear, but from the weight of knowing”) that edge toward purple, but they don’t significantly bog momentum or blur clarity. Overall, line-level craft is well above average and nearly publication-ready as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have varied rhythm, high information density, and multi-function imagery (“ink the color of dried roses,” “dust-mote constellations”) that advances character and atmosphere simultaneously. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and syntax remains clear even in more figurative passages. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent; musical and astronomical images form a consistent palette that supports, rather than muddies, the prose. One could argue for a slight paring in places to let key beats breathe, but there are no significant artifacts or loops that drag momentum or blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and very few redundant or scaffolding lines; many sentences do double duty for mood and plot (“flashlights that cut the dark like poorly aimed scissors” both orients and characterizes the search). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically aligned, avoiding serious metaphor muddle. Rhythm and sentence variety support momentum from porch discovery through the run to the sinkhole and the quiet descent. There are moments of stylistic saturation that edge toward purple, but they do not significantly obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is dense with image yet mostly avoids purple excess; “her maps were alive, shifting with the tides” and “its glow seeping into his skin like ink” are strong, concrete metaphors. Sentences vary in length and cadence, giving the piece an appealing musicality. There’s little scaffolding or repetition and almost every line does at least two jobs (worldbuilds and characterizes, or advances mood and theme). At times the figurative load is high, but it stays legible and supports, rather than blurs, the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, vivid nouns, and metaphors that largely cohere with the established sea/crystal lexicon (“like bones in a diviner’s bag,” “like wind through a seashell”). Prose density is high but generally purposeful; most sentences are doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few formulations edge toward familiar or pat (“like an old friend,” the “inside her all along” revelation), and the figurative load is nearly constant, which risks slight overlushness. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and musical, using vivid but controlled figurative language (“monotony was a canvas,” “the case propped open like a hungry mouth”) without tipping into clutter. Sentences vary in length and rhythm to match tension, and almost every line carries multiple jobs (world-building, theme, character). Repetition (“The first note happened…”) feels purposeful rather than looped scaffold. There are no significant clarity issues or mixed metaphors, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffold, and mostly clean, striking metaphors that do more than one job. Rhythm and sentence length vary well, and the prose sustains a lush register without collapsing into confusion. There is some stacking of figurative language (e.g., multiple metaphors in quick succession) that risks slight over-saturation, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No significant loops or artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and most do multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but not gratuitous; similes like “like a sigh” or “like a heartbeat” are clear, grounded, and legible on first read. There’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping; the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. A few phrases approach the edge of lushness, but they do not blur clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and economical; most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without padding or repetition. Imagery is strong and coherent—fire, bone, ash, porcelain, sap, and celestial movement recur in purposeful ways rather than as decorative clutter. While the language is lush, it stops short of purple; there are no mixed metaphors or loops that blunt the closure moment. Rhythm varies well across paragraphs, with quieter lines landing the ending image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences carry image, character, and theme simultaneously. Repetition of motifs (tide, patterns, equations) is controlled and patterned, not an accidental loop. A few lines veer toward explicit abstraction and mild purple (“quiet, serene upheaval of a world remade by a single, deliberate breath”), but they don’t blur meaning or derail momentum. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, just shy of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, image-rich, and multi-functional, advancing mood, character, and world without evident scaffolding. Metaphors (e.g., the corridor’s heartbeat, the door’s paint like sunburnt skin) are apt and not overstacked, and there’s little to no synonym churn or repetition-for-padding. Rhythm modulates nicely between longer, meditative lines and shorter emphatic beats (“But the walls remembered.” “The door groaned open.”). A few phrases gesture toward familiar lyricism, but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely free of scaffold or repetition; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and legible, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple clutter, and the closing cadence lands with precision. There is a slight risk of over-ornamentation in places (“prism parapet,” “ghost of a song no one would remember”), but it never obscures sense or flattens momentum. Copy-level mechanics are clean, and the read-aloud rhythm is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with vivid metaphors (“ebony’s polished grief,” “the quiet violence of hope”) and generally efficient sentences that do more than one job. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum, and there are no major clarity issues or loops; the scene reads smoothly. There is some tendency toward density and abstraction in the thematic lines, pushing the edge of purple but not quite tipping into muddle. Trimming a few over-articulated insights would sharpen impact at an elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (character, setting, theme) with little fat, and metaphors are coherent and sustained (wound/vein/scar, wingspan/echo/song). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; most lines advance mood or meaning. Rhythm is varied and the prose reads cleanly aloud, with no mixed metaphors or purple overgrowth that obscure sense. A top-tier venue might nitpick a few slightly on-the-nose formulations, but nothing here dulls momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and story, and metaphorical density rarely tips into muddle. Images like “snow…like shattered glass” or starlight into “blades of color” are precise and coherent with the world’s logic, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. The prose sustains a high lyric register without obvious strain, though the frequency of figurative language comes close to saturation in places. Crucially, the climax and final images are clear and sharp, not blurred by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, metaphorical vehicles are mostly coherent, and almost every line does double duty for mood and character. Recurrent images (fire, salt, dome, hush) are handled with precision rather than rote repetition. The density of figurative language is very high and occasionally risks purple, but meaning stays clear and momentum doesn’t stall. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; the prose feels intentionally honed.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are precise (“blushing stillness,” “melody losing its notes”), metaphors are coherent, and sentences do multiple jobs without obvious scaffolding. Figurative density is high but purposeful and pattern-consistent, avoiding purple excess or muddle. There are no noticeable loops or mechanical cadences, and the final paragraph efficiently crystallizes prior motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are clear, metaphors largely coherent and thematically unified (wax casting, braids, ice, aurora, sound-into-light), and there is little to no scaffolding or redundancy. The prose frequently does double duty—advancing action while recharging motif—and the rhythm supports a meditative yet forward-moving cadence. There is some density of figurative language, but it’s patterned and controlled rather than purple, and I see no loops or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the ending. A few phrases (“snowmelt ardor given form,” “chiseling regrets from her own ribs”) verge on lushness, which at the margin may slightly over-sugar the already-lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is polished: high information density, minimal redundancy, and figurative language that is mostly fresh and coherent. Sentences often do double-duty (setting plus theme, image plus emotional state), and paragraphing supports momentum rather than stalling it. There is a lot of metaphorical texture, but it rarely tips into muddle or self-contradiction, and the closure image reads crisply. I see very little scaffolding or looped phrasing that would need line edits at an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely efficient: most sentences pull double duty for character and atmosphere, and the read-aloud rhythm is strong. Metaphors are generally apt (“stone groaned, then split like a fruit revealing its seed”; “breath of a thing that had waited centuries to exhale”), though figurative language is frequent enough that it occasionally borders on lushness for such a quiet conflict. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity breaks; cause and effect remain transparent. A touch of tightening—pruning one or two stacked images—would elevate the line-level to elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually carry multiple functions (emotion, world, and theme). Metaphors like "thick as wool, heavy as regret" and "a melody that unspooled like a thread" are apt and coherent with the piece’s aesthetic. There is some figurative stacking ("cellular memory," "sky bled into earth") but it remains legible and doesn’t smother momentum. I see minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, compressed, and often do double duty in advancing mood and character (“He had come here—not for salvage, but for silence…”). The prose flirts with purple in places due to frequent figurative language, but metaphors are largely coherent and thematically aligned (glass, frost, light, fog) rather than mixed or showy. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum is steady despite the lyric mode. The density of imagery in a few spots slightly risks saturation, keeping this just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences pull multiple weights (setting, emotion, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Metaphors are generally fresh and coherent (“stitches uneven as a heartbeat,” roots “stitching wound to wound”) and are not overstacked in a way that muddies clarity. Momentum is well managed for a lyric piece; even reflective passages keep advancing emotional stakes. There are no significant scaffolding loops or syntactic tics that dull the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with information, and do multiple jobs without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is vivid but not chaotic; recurring images (pistachio shells, violet sap, spirals, palimpsest) feel patterned, not purple. Action order and syntax remain clear even in more abstract beats, and there are no visible artifact loops or template cadences. A slight tendency toward conceptual phrasing in peak beats is voice-consistent and doesn’t blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty for setting and character (“flowers that bloomed in reverse” both worldbuilds and thematizes). Figurative language is mostly sharp and coherent, with the “slumbering titan” mountain and “ink in water” unraveling standing out. There is some risk of piling abstractions near the end (“music composed of every question never asked”) which slightly blurs the otherwise crisp emotional beat but doesn’t obscure meaning. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, minimal scaffolding, and strong information density—most lines carry both atmosphere and story function. Metaphors are largely coherent and thematically aligned (gardens of names, ink as dried roses, fog as door), with only rare flirtation with purple that doesn’t materially cloud sense. Momentum is maintained despite lush description, in part because key actions (tearing the page, pressing the swatch, speaking to the mirrors) are given clean, unfussy syntax. There are no meaningful loops or mechanical artifacts that dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (tone, worldbuilding, character) with minimal scaffolding, and the metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent (“pages of frozen breath,” “names that vanished as she read them”). Rhythm varies effectively, avoiding monotony while preserving clarity of action. There is some density of figurative language, but it’s patterned and legible rather than purple, and there are no noticeable loops or filler phrases. A few constructions (“cathedral of brass and silence,” “weight of forgotten rituals”) brush classical fantasy diction, but they’re executed with enough precision not to feel stock.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is tight, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffolding or paraphrase loops; most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) efficiently. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent (sound, vibration, breath, stone, and silence motifs), so it reads as deliberate lyricism rather than purple drift. Momentum holds despite the lyric density because each descriptive move tends to align with Eldrin’s current micro-action. The main limitation, at an elite bar, is that rhythm stays in a fairly uniform meditative register even around the fissure and recoil, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally high-density, and most images do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme together). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; metaphors like “a shard of hush” and “thistle-blown moment” are coherent and tonally apt. There is little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the prose carries momentum despite its lyricism. At times it edges toward purple, but clarity and the closure image remain crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) and the rhythms vary enough to keep the lyric style from bogging down. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; the central metaphors (fog, river/vault, hush) stay coherent rather than stacking mixed images. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the closure beats land in clean, pared-back prose that sharpens their effect. A few abstractions (“sculpting identity from experience”) could be marginally more embodied, but they don’t measurably blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with function, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery (“petals like embers caught in slow motion,” “the hush was thick enough to chew”) is vivid and mostly precise, with metaphor density high but not incoherent. There is some flirtation with purple, especially in the didactic-feeling final lines, yet it doesn’t obscure meaning or momentum. No significant syntactic or mechanical issues; the prose carries both atmosphere and story efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and musical, with high information density—most sentences do double duty (image + emotion or theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically aligned; metaphors of water, cloth, and shells recur purposefully rather than as ornament. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates that sap momentum, and grammar/punctuation are clean. The only minor limit is that density occasionally risks over-lyricism, but it doesn’t materially harm clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is exceptionally clean: metaphors are coherent and extended rather than stacked randomly, and nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) without bloat. Repetition is patterned (“silence had a flavor”; ribs, vines, hush) and functional rather than artifact, and there are no obvious synonym loops or scaffolding sentences. The prose stays legible despite its density, with cause and effect always trackable through the lyricism. A few moments flirt with purple, but they never obscure stakes or action, so momentum remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence structures, high information density, and imagery that is vivid yet mostly controlled and coherent (“storm glass vial,” “train tracks curved like old scars”). There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or the central conceit. The prose occasionally leans toward lush with stacked metaphors, but it stops short of purple or confusing, and no figurative muddle blurs the closure. Copy is clean, and the opening and final lines form a satisfying rhythmic and conceptual bracket.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, concise, and image-rich without tipping into muddle; metaphor density is high but controlled, and most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and plot). There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and the action order remains clear even through lyric description. Key images—the ruby flake as dying star, the mirror-ceiling shattering, the fruit becoming “ordinary red”—are both vivid and legible. A few phrases lean toward familiar elevated fantasy diction, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but mostly economical: many lines do double duty for atmosphere and character, and overt repetition is minimal. Figurative language (“the last ember…like a dying heartbeat,” “smoke taught you how to breathe”) is strong and coherent, with very few mixed or strained metaphors. A couple of abstractions (“loaded emptiness,” “debt called due”) flirt with purple but stay anchored enough in the concrete frame not to blur sense or slow momentum. Rhythm and paragraphing support the gradual tightening without noticeable scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is tight, controlled, and often doing multiple jobs per line—worldbuilding, character, and theme fuse smoothly (“promises were currency and trust the only collateral”). Figurative language is rich but well-managed; images of pressure, light, loops, and seams recur coherently without devolving into mixed metaphors or purple churn. Sentence rhythm varies nicely, with short emphatic lines at key beats (“She twisted the bolt.” / “She didn’t check it.”). There are a few slightly overt thematic sentences near the end, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm and length, and most carry multiple jobs (world, mood, character) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and specific (“silvering peeled away in jagged strips like the skin of a molting serpent”), and it supports rather than smothers clarity. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences; motion and conceptual progression keep momentum in a contemplative piece. A few metaphors (“golden shadows,” “bridge of intuition”) are revisited often, but as motifs rather than redundant decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, clean syntax, and images that generally clarify rather than obscure (“time was a wound and possibility the blood” maintains internal logic). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, so the texture occasionally verges on saturation, risking sensory overload in places where a plainer line might sharpen impact. Even so, there are no serious artifacts, redundancies, or clarity failures that damage the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for character and atmosphere. Images like “dust patterns settle like fallen snow, revealing a life in fragments” are vivid without becoming overwrought. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; information moves forward with each line. A light preference for figurative language in the opening is controlled and pattern-consistent, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are lean yet dense, images are mostly precise, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with recurring motifs (reflections, static, ripples) reinforcing theme rather than piling up randomly. Repetitions such as “Somewhere, a phone was ringing” feel patterned and purposeful, not like artifacts. A few formulations flirt with slogan (“just another pretty lie under the sun”), but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied in rhythm, and carry multiple jobs (image, mood, and narrative movement) with little padding. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and purposeful, with only occasional near-overload that doesn’t quite tip into muddle. Repetition (“only played. / Only hushed. / Only held…”) reads as intentional patterning, not scaffolding. There are no significant clarity issues or loops, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding, and rhythm varies effectively between long, incantatory lines and shorter shocks (“Today, though, her fingers stilled.”). Figurative language is frequent but generally clean and non-contradictory, supporting rather than obscuring sense. There are no visible scaffold repetitions or clarity issues, and both opening and closing images are strong and precise. At times the density of ornament flirts with overrichness, but it never decisively muddies action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are striking yet mostly precise (“water fell in slow, deliberate sheets… black as a held breath”), and sentences tend to do double duty for mood and information. Figurative density is high but rarely muddled, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum carries smoothly through the accumulative structure. A few formulations nudge toward purple or slogan-like, but they don’t obscure sense or closure. Overall, the prose feels publication-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) without padded scaffolding, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Metaphors (“rain-washed walls weeping rust,” “luminous regret”) are vivid and mostly controlled, with no major mixed or incoherent figures. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“weight,” “gold,” “cracks”) and thesis-like lines that slightly blunt the sharpness of certain images. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no obvious loops or structural artifacts dragging the close.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the writing is polished and musical, with strong imagery and generally tight syntax; sentences pull double duty for mood and information. There is a high density of figurative language (“like a held breath,” “cracked harp string,” “summer’s laughter trapped in their fragile curls”) that occasionally edges toward lushness but does not muddle clarity. Scaffolding and repetition are minimal, and the final cadence is clean and resonant. A touch more restraint in metaphors at non-peak moments could sharpen impact even further, but this is already well above average craft.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and images that generally do more than one job (“answers pried loose with ultraviolet lamps and serrated silence”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors or confusion. A few phrases (“the mathematics of mercy,” “ledger of absences”) border on abstraction or repetition, yet they remain anchored enough in concrete context not to stall momentum. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; the prose drives steadily toward the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, precise diction, and images that usually multi-task for setting, character, and theme. There is a lot of figurative language, but most metaphors are coherent and well-chosen; repetition of motifs (anchors, between, light) feels patterned rather than accidental. At times the prose edges toward over-saturation and thematic redundancy around intuition/anchors, slightly dulling impact near the end. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and most sentences earn their place.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: high information density, clean syntax, and metaphor that is both vivid and coherent (“acrobats” of dust, “dead stars” of falling bolts) without sliding into muddle. There’s virtually no scaffolding or synonym-churn; each sentence does character, world, or pressure work. The final sentences land crisply, recharging earlier motifs rather than explaining them. The only constraint on a higher score is that the prose, while strong, doesn’t quite achieve the startling, unmistakable singularity of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and plot without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent (“veins beneath translucent skin,” “books unraveling into silk threads”) and supports, rather than obscures, sense. There are no significant paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or clotted phrasings that blunt the closure image; momentum carries cleanly through to the end. The prose sits right at the edge of ornate but remains controlled enough for immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—images often carry worldbuilding, emotion, and theme simultaneously (“measured time not in ticks, but in visible threads”). Figurative language is rich yet coherent, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony while sustaining a solemn cadence. There are no notable loops, scaffolding, or muddled metaphors, and syntax remains clear even when sentences lengthen. The baroque style occasionally brushes against ornamentation but generally stays in service to character and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level work is dense and musical—images like “thieves choking on truth like swallowed needles” and “golden threads of dawns swallowed by midnight’s maw” are vivid yet legible. Most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The figurative load is heavy but rarely tips into muddle; metaphors stay within a coherent field (music, metal, light, rust). For an elite market, a few images could be pared to avoid flirting with purple, but overall craft is strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, precise, and information-dense, with most doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language is controlled and apt (“water…still as a held breath”; “arches…where every question only birthed another”), with no mixed metaphors or purple excess that obscure sense. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; momentum is steady despite the lyrical mode. A few abstractions (“hinged awakenings”) verge on conceptual, but they’re grounded enough by the arches and hinges motif to avoid muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: varied sentence rhythms, evocative but controlled imagery, and high information density with minimal scaffolding. Metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically unified (loom, ribs, layers), avoiding mixed or muddled comparisons. A few lines edge toward purple (“storm’s turbine-hum filled his skull”) but they’re consistent with the chosen register and don’t impede clarity or momentum. There are no noticeable loops, mechanical cadences, or grammatical slips dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with images often doing double duty for setting and theme. There is some repetition of structure and concept (“Some things…”, “Some questions…”, “Like the postcards. / Like the glass. / Like the quiet. / Like her.”) that verges on paraphrase, though it still carries some incantatory effect. Figurative language is mostly apt and not over-stacked, and there are no grammar or clarity issues. Trimming a few near-duplicate insights would further sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is strong, with high information density and generally sharp, purposeful imagery (“ink bleeding into the shape of screams,” “sand like erasure”). There are occasional familiar phrases and direct thematic formulations (“weight of stories never told,” “buried secrets”) that slightly dull the edge of otherwise striking lines. Rhythm and sentence variety are well-handled; there are no real loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles that impede clarity or momentum. The final paragraph in particular marries image and idea with good control.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and purposeful, with images doing multiple jobs (e.g., phosphorescent tide as both eerie setting and residual life; “working memory…crucible” as character and concept). There are occasional near-repetitions of idea (“not as it had been, but as it *was*” / “not as it had died, but as it might live again”) that feel slightly redundant, though they don’t materially drag momentum. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding metaphor muddle or purple excess. Sentences vary nicely in length and structure, keeping the page alive without showy pyrotechnics.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but largely precise, with metaphors (“thin as a whisper, brittle as old bone”; “raw and rough as a root breaking stone”) that are coherent and apt to the world’s logic. Information density is high—most sentences advance world, mood, and character simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few lines push toward ornate (“salt-thick air,” “labeled…like a child’s forgotten sigh”), yet they still serve tone and theme rather than drifting into decorative excess. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum, and the final lines land with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is dense and often beautiful (“The cap unfurled. Not like a flower—like a wound healing in reverse.”), with good information density and minimal scaffolding. However, figurative language is very frequent, especially in high-pressure beats, flirting with purple and leaving little room for plainer, grounding lines; this slightly dulls impact via saturation. Clarity remains high throughout, but a touch more tonal contrast would let the strongest images hit harder.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and minimal redundancy; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Imagery is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, and metaphors (rope as thread of warning, sanctuary above a “restless sea” of clouds) reinforce the core motif rather than scatter. There is some stylistic sameness in the elevated, poetic register, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or blur meaning. Mechanics are clean, and the final lines land clearly without figurative muddle or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with good sensory density and many lines doing double duty for mood and character (“the universe whispered secrets only the patient could hear”). Sentence-level rhythm varies nicely, avoiding mechanical templates, and the narrative flows smoothly without confusing syntax. There is some repetition of thematic phrasing and a mild tendency toward purple, aphoristic language in the final third, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or the closure image. Overall, line-level craft is polished and nearly publishable, just a touch over-explicit in peak thematic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty with image and concept (“their wax combs long since melted into golden tears”), and momentum is maintained despite a reflective mode. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and non-muddled, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Some abstractions (“weight of unspoken things,” “promises sealed away when the land began to die”) could be fractionally sharpened or grounded, and a handful of near-identical cadences hint at mild over-patterning. Nonetheless, clarity, rhythm, and charge remain high through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and purposeful; nearly every sentence carries either image, mood, or thematic work, with few redundancies. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so stacked as to blur meaning, and the rhythm at opening and closure is particularly strong. There are moments of near-purple flourish and a couple of on-the-nose formulations, yet they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure action. Line-level craft is comfortably at or near publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: imagery is vivid yet coherent, and most sentences do double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; metaphors stay within a coherent water/light/breakage palette, avoiding muddle. There’s minimal redundancy and momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. A few lines flirt with purple or slogan (“sealed with tar and hope”), but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: images like “as if the trees hadn’t leaned into the wire like lovers” and “her breath to something thin, like wind through dead leaves” are fresh and thematically apt. Sentences generally do double-duty—advancing character and world while sustaining mood—without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. The prose approaches lushness but avoids purple excess; metaphors stay coherent and rooted in the story’s material palette (stone, roots, metal, breath). Rhythm varies naturally, and the final paragraphs land with clear, unfussy images.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient: images often do double duty for mood and theme without bloated redundancy, and there’s little scaffold or synonym churn. Metaphors are mostly coherent and apt to the world (memory, rain, bronze, spiral), and sentence rhythm modulates well between description and pivotal beats. A few moments verge on rhetorical flourish (e.g., consecutive rhetorical questions, stacked abstractions around “homesick universe”), but they don’t obscure meaning or blur closure. Line-level control is strong enough for immediate publication in most elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is tight, image-rich, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (broken rib jetty, syllables like smoke from damp kindling, “slow, green vengeance”) are coherent and controlled, not piled to opacity, and rhythm varies well. There are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or filter-verb stacks that drag momentum. It’s not quite flawless—some phrases echo well-worn literary textures—but it is very near publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with images doing double duty for setting and theme (“the ground split like a broken promise”). Repetition is mostly purposeful, creating cadence rather than loops, and there is little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. A few aphoristic constructions and mirrored lines (“The world outside was a scar. / The world inside was a promise.”; “The distance had become a wound. / The wound, a bridge.”) brush against purple or self-conscious design but do not obscure clarity or momentum. Overall, the prose propels rather than stalls, with only minor over-inflation at the thematic crest.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is strong: specific nouns, clean verbs, and figurative language that generally earns its place (“a bloom in reverse,” “a bell tolling underwater”) without accumulating into purple prose. Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening mood, and reinforcing motif—and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding redundancies. The cadence supports momentum, with paragraph breaks falling at meaningful emotional or conceptual shifts. A few metaphoric pairings could arguably be pared for maximal sharpness, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, densely informative, and many images do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and legible, with few mixed or strained metaphors; the piece sustains its lyricism without collapsing into mush. There is minimal redundancy and strong forward momentum, especially impressive given the contemplative tone. A slight trim of occasionally lush modifiers could tighten impact even further for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, information-dense, and almost every line advances either mood, world logic, or thematic charge. Metaphors are mostly clean and mutually reinforcing (“voices layered like sediment,” “edges fraying like tattered silk”), with only rare risk of over-saturation but no real muddle. Repetition of key words (*remember, unbind, tell, witness, release, home*) is patterned and functional rather than looped scaffolding. The prose remains clear even at peak lyricism, with no significant artifacts or redundancies dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme at once), and there’s very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is abundant but largely coherent and non-muddled; images like “dreams he substituted for reality,” “notes curling into the air like smoke,” and “dust…like shattered stars” land cleanly. Rhythm and sentence length modulate with scene energy, especially around the mountain’s groan and the door’s appearance. A few metaphors (“the pain of remembering…a slow unspooling of self”) verge on familiar and the overall density borders on purple in spots, but clarity and momentum never truly suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“a sound that wasn’t sound at all”). Recurring images (thunder, threads, board, labyrinth) are controlled rather than overworked, and there are no major scaffold loops or clarity issues. A few phrases flirt with purple or slight redundancy (“no longer frozen, but alive”; “the quiet alchemy of forgiveness”), but they do not materially blunt the closure. Overall line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lean for its density: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without redundancy, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally consistent with the bone/echo/refraction motif; it rarely feels mixed or indulgent. Line rhythm supports momentum, especially through short, pointed sentences at the ritual’s crescendo (“The chant faltered.” “The light above pulsed, unstable.”). I see no loops or artifacts that obscure causality or blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but largely precise, with most sentences doing double duty (advancing image and theme) and few true redundancies; the ear for rhythm is strong and closure lands cleanly on the level of line. Metaphors are generally coherent and grounded in the story’s material palette (metal, corrosion, stitching), building a unified texture. There are isolated phrases that flirt with purple or cliché (“edge of oblivion,” “glowing like a promise”), and figurative density is high enough that a very selective trim could sharpen impact further. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum survive the lyricism, and no line-level issue blurs causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character—and few, if any, redundant loops. Metaphors are largely apt and coherent (mirror reflecting futures, caves breathing, pool as “temporary eternity”) without crowding each other. There is some risk of purple saturation, but it remains just on the controlled side and doesn’t obscure sense or causality. Line-level craft comfortably meets elite-publication standards, though a touch more textural contrast (plain alongside lush) could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly every line does double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding muddle or mixed metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; images are specific and memorable (e.g., oil “like a half-spoken promise,” the cork pulsing like a second heartbeat). The prose sustains momentum without clutter, and the final paragraphs land cleanly with charged, economical images.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense with imagery but mostly avoids purple excess; similes and metaphors are sharp and coherent with the maritime, ruin-haunted setting (“like a barnacle,” “color of old bruises”). Sentence rhythm varies well, and nearly every line carries either character, mood, or world-building information without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There are stacked figurative moves in a few places, but they don’t blur sense or stall momentum at this length. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final paragraphs land with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lean for its lyricism: most sentences carry multiple loads (image, worldbuilding, character) without redundancy, and there’s strong rhythmic variety. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, with very few mixed or overloaded metaphors; “revelation was a blade, not a balm” is a standout. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and the final paragraphs land with clear, sharp imagery. A slight density of metaphor in the opening might be pared back for absolute top-tier minimalism, but it doesn’t harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and nearly every line does double duty for mood and meaning. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, not random purple prose. There are a few near-redundant intensifiers and somewhat on-the-nose phrases in the final third that keep this from the absolute top tier, but they do not obscure clarity or dull the closure image. Overall, the prose comfortably meets elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is very strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (setting, mood, character) without redundancy. Figurative language is vivid but controlled—foxfire in metal, ants like oil slicks, roots like fingers—without devolving into mixed metaphors or clutter. Syntax is varied, and there are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences dulling momentum. If anything, one or two descriptive phrases could be trimmed in the midsection to let the sense of danger breathe slightly more, but this is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and metaphors that are generally precise and reinforcing rather than mixed (“a pulse of crimson light seeping from the ridge, staining the sky like a wound”). The prose sustains momentum; each image typically does at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or theme) and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few lines flirt with purple excess, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. The final paragraphs, in particular, land cleanly and memorably without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, many do double duty (worldbuilding + emotion), and imagery like “moment splitting open like a fruit” or “bridges glowing like veins of molten copper” is striking. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition (“density,” “presence,” “palette of resolve”) and a few slightly overwrought or slogan-like lines that paraphrase nearby ideas. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, with little true scaffolding or muddled metaphor. The prose feels polished, if occasionally a shade purple for elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, with images that mostly land cleanly (e.g., “wings made of memory and static”). There is some metaphor stacking, but it generally coheres and serves character rather than reading as ornamental; redundancy is minimal. The prose maintains momentum even in reflective passages because each reflection sharpens the present conflict. The closing cadence is succinct and potent, avoiding explanatory overrun.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character—and a varied, musical rhythm. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt (fog like breath on glass, screw as language of pressure and yield), and there’s little to no redundancy or scaffolding. A few lines tilt toward overt abstraction or essay-like phrasing, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. Overall, the line-level work is strong and publication-ready with only minor tightening possible around the more declarative thematic sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently strong, with high information density—most sentences carry atmosphere, character, and theme at once. Recurrent structures (“The X… The Y…”) and metaphor chains (storms, breath, scars, runes) form a taught pattern rather than unintentional loops. A few lines verge on purple or over-explicit (“Somewhere, the storm was learning her language,” “each drop a period at the end of a sentence”) but do not obscure clarity or dull closure. Overall rhythm, variation, and precision are at or near elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with metaphors that are both thematically apt and sensorially grounded (the current, roots, “liquid twilight,” the orchard humming under pavement). Sentence rhythm varies well, and almost every line does multiple jobs—advancing scene, revealing character, and reinforcing motif without obvious scaffolding or loops. There is a slight risk of over-lyricism in places, but it doesn’t blur meaning or momentum, and the climactic beats remain clear. Tighter pruning of one or two quasi-epigrammatic sentences would elevate this to truly elite line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and musical, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “time here was a wanderingly exact thing, folding back on itself like the edges of a poorly bound book”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and aligned with the library/linguistic motif, and sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony. There is mild purple-density—nearly every line is metaphorized—which occasionally softens impact rather than sharpening it, but clarity remains intact through closure. Little to no scaffolding or obvious loops; momentum carries cleanly into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and economical for its density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and forward motion) and minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images like the ship “splitting the horizon like a needle through silk” are vivid without feeling mixed or excessive. The countdown structure and varied sentence lengths maintain momentum toward the climax. There are no meaningful scaffold loops or syntactic drumbeats, though one or two modifiers (“em eminently peculiar,” “fragile seams”) verge on familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with very little scaffold or repetition. Metaphors (mycelium as circuit board, lasers as keys) are coherent and thematically aligned, and figurative language is used judiciously rather than saturating every line. The prose maintains momentum despite reflective passages, which are tightly anchored to present stimuli. There are no notable artifacts or muddled images to dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with metaphors that mostly cohere around books, probability, and weather, giving the piece a clear imagistic spine. Sentences carry multiple jobs—advancing action, revealing character, and amplifying atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There is some risk of figurative saturation, yet the clarity of causality and the closure image never suffers. Line-level rhythm supports the shift into the luminous final paragraphs rather than overwhelming them.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and images that usually do double duty (world-building plus emotional shading). Metaphoric language is frequent but largely coherent and controlled, rarely feeling ornamental. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding sentences, or syntactic templates that drag momentum. A touch more restraint in the most metaphor-heavy passages might sharpen impact further, but the closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and many lines doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotional state, e.g., “the tide pulling at its pilings with the same insistence as time pulling at context”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid mechanical feel, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, nudging the edge of purple and slightly dulling impact through saturation. A touch more spareness in a few key lines could sharpen the best images even further.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is fresh and coherent, with no notable mixed metaphors or redundancy, and rhythm modulates well between exposition and charged moments. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence earns its keep. The only small limit is that the consistently high metaphorical density slightly flattens contrast—there are few deliberately plain lines to spike key images even more.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and images that usually do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Recurrent motifs (ring, song, constellations, bone) are reprised without feeling redundant, and there are no significant scaffold or synonym loops. The figurative texture is rich but not yet overblown; it sustains clarity even at the most lyrical points. A touch more syntactic stripping near the climax could sharpen impact further but is not strictly necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and largely multipurpose lines that advance mood, concept, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors are coherent and support the central conceits instead of tangling them. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final paragraphs land with a clean, charged image rather than explanatory overrun. A slight tendency toward uniform lyricism in every sentence keeps it just short of the very top tier, but momentum and clarity never suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphor, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences accomplish multiple tasks (setting, mood, theme) at once. The prose occasionally skirts purple but remains legible and thematically coherent, with repeated silence/music/photography metaphors in a taught pattern rather than random flourish. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and the final lines land with clear, charged images rather than abstract statements. There are no noticeable artifacts or loops that sap momentum or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally excellent: high information density, fresh metaphors, and strong rhythmic control (“Elias smiled, sharp and fleeting, like the strike of a match.”). Repetition of key motifs (fire, ashes, smoke, promises) feels patterned rather than redundant, and almost every sentence pulls its weight. There is a slight leaning toward stacked figurative language (“a volcanic tenderness erupting in his chest”) that edges close to purple in spots, but clarity and momentum remain intact. Tightening 5–10% of the more ornamental phrases would put this at a truly elite line level.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but mostly earns its lyricism: sentences tend to do multiple jobs (advancing action, world, and emotion) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Rhythm varies well between long, humming lines and short emphatic beats (“The water remembered. / That was the problem.”), giving the piece propulsion. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. A few binary constructions (“The treatment had failed. / The dream had not.”) flirt with slogan-like neatness, but they’re still supported by the surrounding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, largely fresh figurative language, and minimal redundancy. Sentences vary in length and structure, creating a readable but textured rhythm suited to a quiet, eerie scenario. A few phrases (“key with no apparent lock,” “quiet persistence outlasted brute force”) come close to thesis statements, but they’re anchored in specific objects and history, so they don’t quite slip into cliché. The final paragraphs maintain clarity and charge without purple excess, which is notable given the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: images are mostly fresh, with high information density and little dead scaffolding. Recurrent motifs of light/dark and breath occasionally approach the edge of overuse but stay coherent and purposeful rather than purple. Syntax and paragraphing modulate pace nicely, and there are no significant clarity or causality issues introduced by the prose. The only small limitation is a slight reliance on similar structures (“the way…” constructions) that could be varied further without altering meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic with strong information density: most sentences do at least two jobs (image, mood, or world-building plus theme or character). Figurative language is frequent but largely disciplined and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple bloat, and there’s little visible scaffolding or synonym churn. Pacing is well managed—brief summary leaps (spreading displays, overnight shifts) keep momentum without feeling like outline. The final images (library as held breath, grotto pulsing with the town’s rhythm) cleanly recharge earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are tight, evocative, and do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is rich but mostly disciplined and coherent, with recurring images (tide, ropes, cages/keys) building a pattern rather than feeling like scattershot ornament. The cadence shifts appropriately as pressure increases, especially around the transformation and island’s release. There are a few slightly familiar phrases (“like a bad dream,” “thick as regret”), but they don’t materially harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, rhythmic, and high-density; most sentences do more than one job (setting, emotion, and theme often intertwined). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with no major mixed metaphors or purple excess, and the rhythm shifts appropriately between stillness and peak moments. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; almost every line earns its place. The final paragraphs in particular achieve a clean, resonant cadence without falling into mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs at once, transitions are smooth, and figurative language is mostly precise and coherent with few if any mixed metaphors. The piece sustains a rich lyric density without collapsing into outright purple prose, and momentum is maintained despite the contemplative mode. That said, abstraction and rhetorical repetition around “boundaries,” “certainty,” and “sacred” accrue in places, feeling a touch over-articulated given how powerfully the imagery already carries the point. Trimming a few exposition-like aphorisms would sharpen impact and further foreground the excellent images.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-dense without tipping into incoherence; most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, character). Motifs like cracked glass, ash, and plant codes recur with variation instead of simple repetition, keeping momentum. A few lines state insights a touch directly (“beauty wasn’t in the colors. It was in the cracks.”), and there’s mild thematic reiteration, but not enough to drag the pacing. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle interfere with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, mostly clean syntax, and a high density of meaningful images—few sentences feel like scaffolding or filler. Metaphors (shattered constellation, sound unfolding like breath, bells that “listen”) are generally coherent and on-theme, and repetition (“between,” “pilgrimage,” “golden”) functions as patterned resonance rather than simple looping. The language occasionally edges toward the purple or expository, especially in some thematic statements, but does not materially blur cause/effect or the closure image. Line-level control is strong enough to carry a lyric, low-plot piece in a demanding venue.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are sharp (“petals woven from copper so thin they trembled like real ones”), sentences carry multiple functions, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition that doesn’t serve pattern. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and coherent, and motif repetition (“light,” “curtains,” “bloom”) feels deliberate rather than purple. A few abstractions around grief’s meaning verge on explanatory, but they don’t significantly dull the closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with images like "rain-beaded skylight fractured the dawn into liquid prisms" and "the hidden geometry of belief" doing double thematic and atmospheric duty. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and non-redundant, and sentences avoid obvious scaffold or synonym loops. Rhythm is well-controlled, especially in the closing movement where shorter, declarative lines ("There was more to map.") punctuate the earlier lushness. A few metaphors ("the cards whispered") are conventional, but they don’t materially dull the otherwise high line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty, advancing atmosphere and interiority together, with few redundancies or scaffolding. Imagery is often striking (“air itself… dissolving into atoms of nostalgia”), and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. There is some flirtation with purple and a cluster of slogan-like lines near the end, but metaphors remain mostly coherent and do not obscure causality or closure. Tightening a few abstract phrases would push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, efficiently layered, and often carry image, mood, and information at once (“books that bloomed with light when touched”). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and non-muddled; metaphors like the stone’s “softly deliberate resistance—like a breath held too long” deepen character and object simultaneously. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective tone. A few abstract formulations (“the quiet ways things change”) tread close to generality but are buffered by concrete context.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is compact and purposeful; images usually do double duty for character and theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple, and metaphors are coherent and apt. Rhythm shifts appropriately between reflective and present-tense action beats, sustaining momentum in what is essentially a quiet piece. Line-level clarity never falters, including at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, vivid figurative language, and varied syntax that mostly sustains momentum. Many metaphors do double duty conceptually and emotionally (“displaced miracles,” “graveyard of dandelions”), and scaffolding sentences are minimal. However, there are stretches of heavy figurative stacking (“tunneling…by examining the rings of things,” “daughter of a displaced miracle”) that risk purple density and briefly blur concrete stakes. These lapses don’t derail clarity but keep the prose from the clean, pressure-responsive precision of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often do double duty (image + emotion or world-rule), and there is very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative density is high but mostly precise and thematically unified (reels/time/film/light; “unused love… like honey left too long in the sun” is vivid and apt). Syntax varies in length and structure to match emotional cadence, and key turns get clean, uncluttered lines that land. Any hint of purple is restrained enough that it doesn’t obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (advancing action while building image and theme), and the figurative language is internally coherent with the story’s cosmology. Phrases like “threads of moments spilling like silk from a loom” and “dates blooming like flowers in fast-forward” are vivid without becoming muddled. The density of metaphor is high but generally purposeful, and there is little redundancy or scaffolding. A slight tendency toward purple, especially in the more expository closing lines about her later success, keeps it just shy of top-tier rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically aware, and economical given the density of image. Recurring constructions (“And Hollow? / Hollow remembered.”) feel deliberately patterned rather than accidental scaffolding, and figurative language is mostly coherent and grounded in the story’s lexicon. There is a slight tendency toward stacked abstractions (“a lattice of moments that shouldn’t exist but did”) that risks softening impact, but it doesn’t meaningfully obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and concept. Repetition (“Only gears. / Only hums.”) and metaphor density feel intentional and mostly coherent rather than purple; images like “a compass made of smoke” and “tuning fork pressed to the ribs of the world” are striking and legible. There’s little scaffolding or synonym churn, and momentum is preserved despite the lyric mode. The high figurative load skirts overload but remains controlled enough that closure lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and efficient: most sentences do double-duty in advancing mood, theme, or character. Sensory detail is selective rather than cluttered, and recurring phrases (ridgeway, twilight, star stamp) create a deliberate pattern. There are minor tendencies toward repetition and aphorism that skirt purple (“twisted like a held breath” echoes the later “twilight… like a held note”), but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is publishable with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and rarely redundant, with images that generally reinforce one another rather than clash. Figurative language is frequent but mostly purposeful and legible, and there are no significant scaffold loops or template cadences. The prose supports momentum—the bolt, vibration, and ascent keep the piece moving despite its lyricism. A few phrases flirt with purple abstraction (“a tuneless, frostbitten hope of a sound”), but they stay just on the right side of evocative, and clarity at the climax is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense yet largely economical; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without slack or obvious scaffolding. Imagery like “scrolls older than memory” and “edges frayed like the hem of a god’s discarded robe” is vivid and internally consistent, and the closing image with the inscription is sharp and resonant. There are no significant loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues, and rhythm varies well. A few lines flirt with purple, but they remain legible and purposeful rather than ornamental noise.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level work is polished: sentences are varied, concrete, and multi-purpose, carrying atmosphere, character, and world-building at once. Repetition (“Some paths didn’t disappear…”) is deliberate and rhythmic rather than an accidental loop. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, extending the central metaphors of tide, memory, and maps without purple excess. I see no grammatical or syntactic artifacts, and momentum holds steady despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, taut, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and action. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, building a unified metaphoric field around sound, light, and wreckage. There are no real paraphrase loops or clunky scaffolding; momentum rarely stalls despite the lyricism. A few abstractions near the end veer close to purple or expository, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are economical yet layered, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“Not with a crack, but a sigh, like a seed pod opening”). Figurative language is mostly apt and controlled; there’s no notable scaffold, repetition, or syntactic monotony. A few phrases flirt with thematic slogan (“tradition with intent”), but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity. The closing cadence is strong and image-driven, honoring prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is controlled and economical despite its lyricism; most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing setting, character, and theme simultaneously). Figurative language is vivid yet coherent (“ghost of foghorns,” leaf veins mirroring cracks and fractures) without stacking into purple muddle. There are no obvious loops or scaffold sentences, and the final paragraphs in particular carry high information density with clean rhythmic control. A few abstract formulations (“a kind of freeze—not of time, but of attention”) are slightly explanatory but don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level writing is controlled, metaphor-rich, and mostly precise, with many sentences carrying multiple jobs (setting, theme, emotion) efficiently. However, figurative density is very high—nearly every line has a metaphor or simile—which edges into purple prose and risks numbing impact. There are no serious clarity issues or loops, and the closure image is clean despite the lushness. Trimming or varying the intensity of imagery would likely sharpen rather than diminish the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid, sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without much fat, and the rhythm adapts to tension beats. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned with time, fracture, and shadow. There are minimal redundancies and no serious clarity issues; the prose reads smoothly aloud. A slight trimming of stacked metaphors in a few spots would tighten it further for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences do multiple jobs, rhythm varies, and figurative language mostly clarifies rather than muddies (“pulse scandalized the stillness” being a rare borderline flourish). There is some repetition of motifs and structures (snow, silence, “for the first time…”) that edges toward purple but stays on the right side of legible and propulsive. No major scaffolding or clarity issues interfere with the climax or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is solid: varied syntax, high information density, and mostly clean, precise imagery. A few lines flirt with repetition or mild cliché (“the world had fallen,” “the roses were not”), and some metaphors tread close to the edge of purple without tipping over. Still, nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs—atmosphere, character, and theme—and momentum is maintained despite the lyric pace. There are no major artifacts or loops dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is tight: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious loops or filler, and the figurative language—“air split like wet silk,” “teeth made of broken echoes”—is vivid yet coherent. Rhythm varies well between short, weighted lines and longer, sinuous sentences, matching shifts in pressure. The closure image (“He smiled. / It smiled back.”) is clean, unsettling, and recharges prior cosmic and mouth imagery without overexplaining. Density of metaphor is high but never tips into muddle or self-contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density—almost every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; the orbit motif, typesetter’s hammer, and comet-like steam feel deliberate rather than piled on. There’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. One could argue for trimming a couple of reflective lines, but they don’t materially drag pace or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid (“humed like a dying star,” “static that coiled around her ribs”) without collapsing into purple prose, and most sentences carry more than one function (atmosphere + character + world). Rhythm varies well, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph meaningfully advances pressure or resonance. Figurative language is dense but coherent, with recurring motifs instead of random metaphor churn. A touch more syntactic spareness at peak tension could sharpen impact further, but the current execution is already publishable-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and high-density: images like “mist coiled… like a held breath” and “a hush so dense it pressed against his eardrums” are vivid yet clear, and very little feels like scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned, and sentence rhythm varies well. Momentum never bogs despite the lyricism, and the closing lines echo the opening textures without redundancy. It stops just short of the absolute top tier due to a few slightly declarative theme lines that could be made more image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and non-redundant (“smoke still curled like a dying prayer,” “plaza held them both”), and there are no real paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies well between short declarative lines and longer, braided sentences, supporting emotional pacing. A few phrases are familiar or slightly ornamental (“steel lived in his bones now”), but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (image plus emotion or world-rule), and there’s little true scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent, but the metaphors are coherent within the synesthetic premise and seldom feel mixed or gratuitous (“petals that crunched underfoot like brittle applause” is emblematic). Momentum holds despite lyricism; the story never stalls to admire its own images. The closing lines in particular land cleanly without purple drift, tying image, action, and theme into a precise cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensory density is high without slipping into confusion, and most metaphors (“thin as a whisper,” “the hue of dawn seen through rain”) are precise and consonant with the world. The prose often does double duty, advancing action and theme simultaneously, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. There is a slight flirtation with purple phrasing (“willowglass hope,” “gesture that wasn’t a gesture”) but it’s controlled and pattern-consistent, not random flourish. Clarity remains intact even under the most abstract beats, which is rare for this kind of lyric SF.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, image-rich, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; most sentences do double duty for mood and information. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (memory as heat, the map of grief, caves exhaling) without devolving into mixed or overwrought strings. There are a few near-repetitions of conceptual phrasing around “voice,” “unknown,” and “transitional,” and one or two sentences edge toward purple, but they do not materially blunt momentum or clarity. The final image of the rain and the missing fossil lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with very little scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm varies in a way that suits each beat. Figurative language is rich but mostly precise and not overstacked; metaphors like “the cliffs slick with the weeping of the amber” reinforce both setting and emotional tone. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic templates, or clarity failures, and the final cadence (“The cliffs stood steady. For now.”) lands cleanly. A few phrases approach purple but remain under control, so momentum and sense are never compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, specific nouns, and multi-function sentences that carry setting, character, and mood simultaneously. Figurative language (“valley stretched like a held breath,” “wind…carried no name”) is frequent but mostly precise and thematically apt, not muddled. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates; rhythm feels intentional rather than mechanical. A few images edge toward purple but do not obscure clarity or flatten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, purposeful repetitions (“One. / … Two.”), and multi-function lines that carry setting, mood, and subtext simultaneously. The figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and thematically aligned (fog as breath, ticking gutters as metronome), with few mixed or confusing metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; most sentences pull their weight in atmosphere or motion. At times the density of imagery skirts the edge of purple, but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and economical for its lushness; images like “hives split open like old wounds” and “glaze shimmering like the last breath of a dying star” are striking yet legible. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined—metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned with light, time, and fracture. There is little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final cadence is clean and resonant. It veers close to purple in density in places, but never quite tips into muddle or drag.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but mostly disciplined: images do double duty for atmosphere and psychology, and there’s little true redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors like “moonlight silvering the water like a blade left too long in the rain” and “moment dissolved like sugar in tea” are vivid and not mutually contradictory. There is a high density of figurative language that edges toward purple in spots, but it doesn’t obscure action or closure. Rhythm varies nicely across sentences and paragraphs, maintaining momentum in a quiet scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) with little scaffold or redundancy, and the rhythm shifts appropriately with the hum’s intensification and release. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise, and images rarely feel mixed or overstuffed; the few slightly familiar phrases (“smelled of rain and possibility”) don’t seriously blunt momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the closing cadence (“Somewhere, a clock began to chime”) lands with clarity rather than haze. Overall density is high without tipping into purple or obscuring cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm and length, and most do multiple jobs (advancing image, mood, and theme together). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and well-matched to the imagery of threads, ripples, and unfolding petals; there are no glaring mixed metaphors or loops. The prose maintains clarity despite its lyricism and rarely stalls momentum. A touch of abstraction in a few thematic lines keeps it from feeling absolutely pristine but doesn’t seriously impede effect.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean and purposeful, with most sentences carrying dual loads of atmosphere and information. Metaphors are frequent but coherent and on-theme, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and the final image of her reaching for the dial again lands cleanly. A minor density of figurative language in places edges toward lushness but never quite tips into purple or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmic and varied, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language (“teeth like the ribs of a starved god,” “streets twisted into knots”) is vivid and generally clear, and it rarely tangles or contradicts itself. The prose balances atmosphere with momentum; nearly every sentence advances either pressure, setting, or theme. It is undeniably lush—borderline purple for the most austere markets—but the control and coherence keep it from bogging down.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or filler. The figurative language is dense but largely coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (wound, silence, mist, erasure) rather than decorative flourish. A few phrases flirt with purple (“furrowing hush of the mist”), yet they don’t obscure sense or undercut the ending. Rhythm on the page reads well aloud and supports momentum despite the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lean for its genre while still vivid; details like “the wind howled like a starving thing” and “like a tuning fork struck against the wrong frequency” are effective and not overstacked. Sentences vary in length and structure, keeping momentum through the inciting discovery and the glass-shattering climax. There’s minimal repetition or scaffolding, and exposition is efficiently folded into action. A few metaphors (“the storm coiled like a fist”) are familiar rather than fresh, but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-to-line prose is dense, imagistic, and largely precise; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character in one move). Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (music, light, grids, roads). A few phrases feel slightly overworked or stacked, risking purple without quite tipping into muddle. Momentum holds across the piece, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is polished and dense, with most sentences doing double duty—advancing atmosphere and character at once—and the rhythm supports the contemplative mode. Figurative language (“rusted into the earth like a forgotten promise,” “glass skeletons glinting…like the ribs of something starved”) is vivid and generally coherent, with no mixed metaphors or clutter. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; the piece moves economically from image to image. A few slightly “writerly” lines risk feeling ornamental rather than strictly necessary, which keeps it just under the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with images doing multiple jobs (e.g., “each star a wound, each story a balm” establishes vocation, tone, and theme at once). There is little genuine scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines introduce fresh information or pressure. A few metaphors skirt the edge of purple or redundancy, yet they don’t materially obscure sense or dull the closure image. Sentence variety and paragraphing create a good read-aloud rhythm that supports the accumulative, contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) without obvious padding, and the rhythm alternates effectively between short emphatic lines and more sinuous description. Metaphors are coherent and thematically unified around frost, hunger, wounds, and keeping, avoiding mixed or confusing imagery. There is some repetition of conceptual frames (“some things…”) near the end, but it functions as controlled cadence rather than scaffolding. Nothing in the final third feels like prose artifact or synonym loop that dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with many lines doing double-duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding (“thorns had sewn her shadows to the soil” is especially strong). Figurative language is dense but usually controlled and thematically aligned with roots, weaving, and eclipses. At times, the accumulation of metaphors verges on purple and risks softening impact, and a few abstractions could be sharpened. Still, there are no major loops or clarity issues, and sentence-level momentum generally carries the reader cleanly through.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and mostly do more than one job, with very few redundancies. Figurative language is rich but generally controlled, and most images are coherent and precise rather than mixed. There is a mild tendency toward aphoristic, summary-like sentences in the final third and some repeated structural beats (“The orchard…” “Somewhere…”) that flirt with pattern becoming predictable. Nonetheless, clarity and propulsion remain intact, and no major artifacts blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences carry multiple functions (character, atmosphere, theme) and avoid redundancy, and the rhythm of clauses and paragraphs is varied and deliberate. Figurative language is apt and controlled—the comparison of dust motes to lighters, or gravel to static, is both clear and thematically charged. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn, and transitions between reflection and action are clean. A few thematic phrases verge on familiar, but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly every line does double duty for setting, character, or theme with minimal scaffolding. The figurative density is high but mostly controlled, with images that feel grounded in the story’s physics and Elias’s mind rather than ornamental. A few phrases (“physics of leaving,” “hour of unbecoming”) recur on the edge of preciousness, yet the piece avoids true purple-prose muddle and remains clear even at the peak beats. Momentum is well maintained for a contemplative piece, with no evident paraphrase loops or explanatory padding.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush but largely precise; most metaphors are internally consistent and carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme). There’s high information density without much scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum in a lyric mode. A few lines verge on decorative abstraction (“their contradictions thrumming—a lullaby of both/and”) but they still align with the story’s governing logic of paradox. Nothing at the line level materially obscures causality or dulls the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: vivid diction, generally efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and meaning, and few genuinely superfluous lines. Some figurative language and thematic phrasing recur in ways that flirt with overstatement but mostly maintain clarity and momentum. Structural echoes (“The pearl wasn’t…,” “She wasn’t…”) reinforce motif rather than read as scaffolding. There are no notable grammar or clarity issues, and the final paragraphs land with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and efficient: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme, often two at once (e.g., the fog as “a second skin” doing psychological and sensory work). Rhythm is varied and mostly avoids loops or scaffolding; figurative language is consistent and seldom overwritten. Occasional phrases verge on the familiar (“sky had turned the color of old bruises”) but remain apt and don’t blur clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only very minor opportunities to trim a slightly aphoristic feel in places.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid and specific, and most sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, and character) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely apt and legible, with no serious metaphor clashes or purple overload, even in peak beats like the library’s collapse. There are no obvious scaffold sentences, synonym loops, or structural repetitions that drag momentum; the piece reads cleanly aloud. A handful of concept-heavy phrases (“each tick a propagation delay unraveling time”) flirt with abstraction but remain comprehensible in context.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with images doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and theme—without obvious synonym churn or scaffolding. Sentences largely avoid repetition and maintain forward momentum, and the figurative language is internally coherent within the story’s surreal-lyric frame. There is mild risk of purple prose, but it never tangibly obscures causality or the closure beat. A slight trimming of modifiers in a few places could sharpen impact, yet this is already strong line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-to-line craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are mostly clean, and nearly every line earns its keep in advancing mood or motion. Figurative density is high but generally controlled, with only a few lines (“radiance on the other side of silence,” “bones of forgotten winds”) flirting with over-ornamentation without breaking clarity. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolds, or syntactic glitches. The prose could be marginally leaner in places, but it already reads at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense without tipping into muddled purple; metaphors (spiral, cradle, scallops, roots) are coherent and interrelated. Nearly every sentence does multiple jobs—world-building, emotional shading, and thematic echo—without visible scaffolding or redundancy. A high concentration of figurative language in places edges toward saturation but remains legible and purposeful, not obscuring action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and rarely redundant, and metaphors (cloak of doubt, quilt, hollow shard) are coherent and sustained rather than piled. The prose balances lyricism with clarity; even the more abstract phrases are grounded by concrete images and actions. There is minimal scaffold or synonym-churn and no real momentum drag despite reflective content. A few sentences verge on purple or expository (“the *protected vulnerability* of a man who’d finally stopped pretending he knew the way”), but they don’t obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are lean yet lush, often doing double duty with image and concept, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is abundant but generally controlled and coherent, with metaphors (sycamore spine, petals of years) aligning to the piece’s motifs. Momentum holds despite the lyric mode, with paragraphing and cadence supporting the trance’s deepening and the snap back. A few images verge on purple but don’t materially blur sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, evocative, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Repetition (“He was the stone. / He was the echo.”) reads as intentional pattern rather than scaffold, and figurative language is mostly clean and consistent with the established metaphoric field (stone, bone, echoes, pulses). There is a slight tendency toward purple/ornamental phrasing and conceptual repetition in the final third, but it doesn’t obstruct clarity or dull the closure image. Overall, the prose would require minimal tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is tight, vivid, and generally high-density—images like “jagged tooth of ice piercing the underbelly of the storm-wracked sky” and the “satchel woven from shadow and twine” do multiple jobs without feeling like ornament. Sentences vary in structure and length; momentum is maintained despite lyricism, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and thematically aligned with light and making; it rarely muddies sense or pacing. Line-level control holds through the ending, where “The fire roared in answer” lands cleanly without explanatory overrun.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, clean, and purposeful, with few redundancies and a consistent forward movement. Imagery is rich but mostly controlled; only a couple of lines (“blade through veil after veil of half-truths,” “a gold that tasted like honey”) flirt with purple without tipping into confusion. There are no major loops, mixed metaphors, or structural artifacts that obscure action or cost, and the final paragraph is compact yet resonant. A slight trimming of figurative density in one or two spots would bring the prose to a truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is tightly controlled, with high information density and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; most sentences do double duty for mood and concept. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and internally consistent (e.g., Morse, mirrors, spiral, hum, contraction). Momentum is maintained despite the lyrical mode; the line-level never seriously obscures causality or the closure image. There is a mild tendency toward cosmic abstraction in a few phrases, which slightly blurs the sharpness of otherwise excellent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is excellent: sentences are clean, evocative, and information-dense, with metaphors that generally sharpen rather than blur (“voices…curling like smoke,” fears slipping “like eels,” bones absorbing light). There’s minimal scaffold or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere, world-building, or thematic tension. The rhythm on the page—alternating lush description with shorter emphatic sentences—creates strong propulsion despite the meditative mode. A few metaphors skate near purple, but they remain legible and pattern-consistent, so they don’t materially drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and purposeful, with figurative language that is largely clean and thematically aligned (“spine of frozen lightning,” “the bay remember how to breathe”). Information density is high—most lines carry character, setting, and theme at once—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few constructions verge on lush repetition (e.g., multiple sentences explicitly flagging “imbalance” and “possibility”), but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur sense. The final paragraph’s cadence lands with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density and images that usually do multiple jobs (e.g., “sapphire hue” tying bottle, reservoir, and memory). A few metaphors veer close to purple (“reservoir’s buried bones,” “smoke from a hundred extinguished lanterns”), but they remain coherent and thematically aligned rather than distracting. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold; sentences advance mood, character, or action without obvious padding. Rhythm supports the slow-burn pressure and the closure image is clear and uncluttered by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is polished and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“a sound like glass bells ringing backward through time”). There is heavy use of figurative language, but most of it is coherent and purposeful rather than gratuitous. A few moments verge on purple or slightly redundant, and the density of similes could be trimmed to sharpen impact. Still, momentum holds and clarity is not compromised at the climax or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is tight: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely apt (“canopy unfurling like a held breath released”; “edges frayed like old nerves”), with no major mixed metaphors or obscuring flourishes. Information density is high yet clear; each paragraph advances mood, stakes, or action. A few abstractions (“things unsaid,” “weight of the burden”) skim generic, but they’re anchored quickly enough in concrete images to avoid real drag.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“like a ghost wearing skin,” “the Schism’s wound stitching shut with a sound like tearing silk”). Rhythm varies effectively, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few metaphors and abstractions (“storm’s last drops fell like blessings,” direct invocations of “truth” and “numbness”) lean toward the familiar or slightly purple, softening the otherwise sharp line-level work. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and the closure image is clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, purposeful, and largely free of scaffolding or synonym loops, with images (the seed like “a dried scorpion’s heart,” ink like “beetle-shells”) that are vivid but not overstacked. Exposition is woven economically into action and perception, and there are no major rhythm stumbles or confusing constructions. The prose maintains momentum even through time jumps, compressing weeks and months into clean, charged beats. A few metaphors echo the same conceptual field (doors, thresholds, outside answer), but they build a pattern rather than feeling redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tightly controlled, with high information density and evocative yet comprehensible imagery; figurative language generally pulls its weight and avoids muddle. Sentence rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few images push toward the ornate (“macerated the silence”) but remain legible and in tune with the piece’s lyric mode. The closing images (blower left like an accusation, hourglass “finally full”) land cleanly without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (light/dark, pages, breath), and it rarely slips into muddle. Pacing is efficient, with no obvious filler paragraphs or paraphrase loops dulling momentum. A few metaphors (“like birds,” “like a friend”) are more conventional than the best of the piece, shaving a bit off the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary rhythmically, pack multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and action), and mostly avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but controlled, with images cohering around heat/cold, fracture/healing, and breath/pennies falling rather than spinning out into mixed-metaphor mush. There are almost no paraphrase loops or filler sentences, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. The high density might toe the edge of purple for some editors, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is strong: dense images, purposeful repetition, and high information-per-sentence with few redundancies. Metaphors like “lightning made gentle” and “shard of hush” are striking yet coherent, and grammar and sequencing are clean. There is some risk of purple prose, as figurative language appears in many lines and a few phrases verge on self-consciousness, but it rarely obscures sense or momentum. Tightening one or two overtly didactic sentences would lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is high quality: metaphors are vivid yet controlled (“cut through the black water like a blade through silk”), sentences vary in rhythm, and nearly every line does double duty in building world and mood. There’s no evident scaffolding, synonym churn, or figurative muddle; the closing beats in particular are clean and potent. A few images lean familiar (“black water,” “vanished into the dark”), which keeps this just shy of exemplary at the elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, information-dense, and most images do more than one job, advancing both mood and concept. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and legible (“a blackness that hummed,” the thread as “pliable as thought but sharp as glass”), avoiding mixed metaphors or jargon. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the prose rarely stalls momentum. A few phrases verge on purple, but they don’t materially blur causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: varied sentence rhythms, strong verbs, and layered images that usually do more than one job (worldbuilding + theme + emotion). Metaphors about light, edges, and unfolding are largely coherent and patterned, avoiding mixed-image muddle. There is some risk of purple (“like the memory of a forgotten sun,” “the somber marvel of a civilization realizing it had been looking the wrong way”), but it stays within controlled lyricism and doesn’t impede clarity or momentum. Scaffolding and redundancy are minimal; nearly every line earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, often doing double duty for mood and information. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent with the story’s sensory palette; metaphors extend the sound/static motif effectively rather than clashing. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the prose maintains momentum even during reflective beats. A slight density of similes in the opening third edges toward lushness but doesn’t impede clarity or the closing image’s force.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and efficient, multi-function sentences; most lines carry atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the figurative language is coherent with the world (cables as serpents; silence that’s “full”). There is some mild over-reliance on parallel clause structures and reiterative constructions, especially near the end (“He would return. / He always did.”), which slightly blunts momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is never compromised, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and images that usually do more than one job (e.g., auroras as heartbeat, shard as rosary). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and legible; there’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. A few lines verge on purple or explicative (“how easily a life could be erased by a keystroke”) but don’t materially blur clarity or dull the closing image. Overall line craft is strong and publication-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient, with images doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) and very little true redundancy. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and tonally unified; metaphors like “voices were the texture of crumbling parchment” feel apt rather than purple. Sentence rhythm varies and supports momentum into the climax, with the last paragraphs tightening nicely. A few lines verge on ornamental, but they don’t materially slow or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is mostly precise and fresh, though motif repetition (“the joke,” “some…”) and multiple parenthetical asides flirt with over-patterning in the final third. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph tends to add new pressure or angle. The climactic and closing images remain clear despite the density, so the lyricism rarely muddies sense.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, world, or emotional stakes simultaneously. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and there are no major syntactic artifacts or loops that drag momentum. A few phrases flirt with mild purple or repetition (“resonantly soft,” several breath/sigh images), but they don’t obscure sense or closure. The final images are clean and legible, carrying the story’s weight without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is sharp: most sentences do double or triple duty, advancing setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously with minimal scaffolding. The figurative density is high but rarely feels overwrought; images tend to be precise, emotionally keyed, and non-redundant. Syntax and paragraphing vary in rhythm to match tension, especially around the bottle opening and the run to the post office. A few lines flirt with purple or thesis-summarizing, but they do not materially blunt clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density and generally purposeful figurative language (“mane… like captured sunlight,” “misting hush,” “edges jagged like a broken promise”). Repetitions (“misting hush” twice, some silence/whispering echoes) feel motif-driven rather than looped scaffolding. There is a slight flirtation with purple in places and stacked modifiers, but clarity and momentum are not harmed, including at the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, musical, and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme) without feeling overladen. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent with the central geometric/curvature motif; mixed metaphors are largely avoided, and key images (folds, curvature, negative space) recur with intent. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final lines (“The scarf was gone, but the library remembered its shape. / And that was enough.”) land cleanly and memorably. You could trim a couple of near-synonymous abstractions (“where stories lived wasn’t a shelf or a page, but the curvature between them”) for even leaner punch.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and image-rich, but most sentences do more than one job—worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once—without obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and pattern-consistent (light, ink, sea, books) rather than mixed at random. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous lines and shorter, punctuating beats at key turns (“The first attempt failed.”). It flirts with purple in places, yet clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: images like “doorknobs that turned backward, chests that whispered” and “hummed like a held breath” carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). Metaphor density is high but mostly controlled; a few lines flirt with abstraction, yet clarity is preserved. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and sentences vary in length and cadence to maintain momentum. Nothing at the closure beat feels muddled or overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, image-dense, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or premise. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and apt (“hollowed out like a gourd,” “hummed… like a held note”), and there are no obvious loops or template cadences. The rhythm of clauses and paragraphing supports momentum through long, reflective stretches without stalling. The main limitation is a slight over-saturation of figurative language in places, which risks numbing individual images’ impact at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, characterization) with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent, building a consistent metaphoric field around doors, thresholds, and reflection. Rhythm varies nicely between long, lush description and clipped, charged beats during the shadow’s surge. It flirts with density in places but never quite tips into purple or obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, character, theme) with very little scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm has a pleasing, varied flow. Figurative language—“fruit that glowed like captured sunsets,” “kindness with teeth,” “language made of light”—is vivid and usually precise, avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. While the density of imagery is high, it feels patterned and purposeful rather than purple for its own sake, and key beats remain crystal clear. There are no significant loops or artifacts that sap momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, images are largely precise, and most metaphors (prisms as fractured whispers, silence woven into nets) pull multiple weights at once. There’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase, and the prose sustains momentum despite its lyric density. A few moments nudge toward purple, but they don’t muddle sense or undercut the closure image. Overall, the language feels deliberate and economical for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are lucid, economical for their lyricism, and usually do double duty (worldbuilding and theme, or character and mood). Repetition of motifs like “silence,” “tear,” and “map” reads as deliberate patterning rather than padding. There are no significant loops or muddled metaphors; images such as the frescoes rippling “like water” and the tear glowing “like embers” are clear and grounded. A few abstract assertions of meaning could be sharpened into fresher images, but they don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“where books had bloated into pulpy sculptures and the brass reading lamps still cradled ghosts of light”). Rhythm varies well, and there is little redundancy or scaffolding. At times the figurative layer borders on lush—there are multiple high-concept metaphors in close proximity—which very slightly risks saturation, but clarity and momentum are preserved throughout and the closing cadence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images are concrete, and most metaphors are coherent and multi-functional. Phrases like “air hung thick as wet silk between lightning and thunder” and “a chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby” are evocative and on-theme. There is some risk of figurative overload—multiple metaphors stacked in quick succession in early paragraphs—that edges toward purple without quite tipping into opacity. Trimming a few adornments in high-pressure beats would increase impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length, images are generally sharp, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character at once). A few metaphors risk stacking toward purple (“bones,” “broken promises,” “a tune you almost recognized”) but they remain thematically linked and legible. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum is maintained despite reflective density. The richness of figurative language in almost every paragraph slightly flirts with overload, which keeps this out of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are largely clean, sentences are purposeful, and there’s minimal redundancy; phrases like “the hollows where grief pooled like rain in a forgotten cup” are both precise and thematically loaded. Figurative density is high but mostly controlled, and the metaphors hang together under the sky/emptiness lexicon rather than feeling random. A few abstractions (“weight of things he couldn’t name,” “weight of every unspoken word”) generalize where even sharper particulars could live, and the prose occasionally edges toward purple without adding pressure. Still, momentum and clarity hold throughout, and the closure image is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and generally avoids redundancy; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (wound in the tree, catching smoke, sky inside walls), with few if any mixed or overwrought moments. Rhythm varies and the paragraphing supports momentum, especially around the safe opening and demolition sequence. A slight density of figurative language in some paragraphs comes close to purple but doesn’t obscure clarity or dull the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-to-line craft is polished: sentences are well-shaped, sensory, and generally do more than one job (advancing action while building atmosphere or theme). Figurative language—“light hummed in her ribs,” “clouds curled like ink”—is mostly fresh and coherent, with no serious mixed metaphors or clotted patches. There is some mild thematic repetition of “light,” “luminous,” and horizon that verges on sentimental emphasis but doesn’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity. Overall, the piece reads smoothly and aloud-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, information density is high, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent; it rarely feels like ornament for its own sake, and there are no serious loops or scaffolding artifacts. The prose flirts with lushness bordering on purple in places, but clarity and momentum are preserved through clean syntax and purposeful focus on action beats when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the metaphors are mostly clean and controlled. Phrases like “nebula of respite” and “cracks of the cosmos” recur with evolving meaning rather than as ornament. There are a few abstracted or slightly didactic lines (“That’s how collective effort works”) that flatten the otherwise rich texture, but they don’t significantly harm momentum or closure. Overall, information density and musicality are high without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful repetition, and almost no scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is abundant but coherent in its domains (time, breath, sea, song), so it rarely muddies sense. A few phrases edge toward purple or overlap conceptually (“slow wound through the dusk,” “nested patterns”) without adding new pressure, but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. Overall propulsion and clarity remain intact through to the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense; description, worldbuilding, and character history often share the same line (“its edges frayed, its ink the color of old bruises”). Repetitions like “She had spent years…” are patterning rather than scaffolding, and there is little to no synonym churn or filler. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; metaphors (oil on water, old bruises, silver fingers of frost) enhance mood without piling up. Line-level craft supports momentum and clarity throughout, with no artifacts that blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally precise, dense, and musical, with images doing multiple jobs—character, theme, and setting at once. Metaphors are mostly clean and coherent (bridges, symphony, scaffolds, river braids) and avoid serious mixing; line-level rhythm supports the contemplative pressure. There are a few slightly over-familiar or on-the-nose formulations (“symphony of erosion,” “pieces fall into place,” “had to be allowed to flow”) that read more like writerly ornament than necessity. Still, there are no real loops or scaffolding artifacts, and momentum remains intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, musical, and densely imagistic, with most sentences doing double duty for setting, theme, and character. Figurative language is frequent but not purple: metaphors are coherent and aligned with the book/library/weather motifs, and there are no mixed or confusing images. Repetitions (“They always did,” echoing door chime and “the lull was over”) operate as purposeful pattern rather than scaffolding or loops. Rhythm varies effectively—longer, lush lines for atmosphere, then shorter, declarative beats at closure—maintaining momentum without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often striking: metaphors are mostly clean and apt (“like iron left too long in saltwater,” “fossilized grief”). Information density is high, with lines typically doing double duty for atmosphere and character. There is a mild risk of over-ornamentation—multiple similes and rich images cluster in some paragraphs—but they don’t significantly obscure sense or slow momentum at this length. Scaffolding and redundancy are minimal, and the final lines land with crisp precision.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“their voices lingering in her ribs like an afterglow”). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and legible; it rarely clots into purple or mixed metaphors. A few phrases feel slightly self-conscious or overtly crafted, but they don’t materially drag momentum or obscure action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful images, and few if any redundant scaffolding sentences. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned (canyon as wound, moon as scalpel), and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. There is a near-constant figurative charge, which occasionally edges toward purple and risks saturation in places like “quaking reverie of the moon,” but clarity and propulsion remain intact. Minor tightening of a couple of stacked metaphors would bring it into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is dense but purposeful: images usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without sliding into muddle, and there is very little redundancy. Phrases like “the air ripped—not like fabric, but like a held note suddenly released” exemplify the piece’s knack for precise, sensory metaphor. A few stacked modifiers (“clandestinely luminous,” “sickle into jagged rainbows”) skate near purple, but they don’t impair clarity or pacing. Sentences vary in length and structure enough to keep momentum, and there are no evident grammatical or sequencing slips.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, atmosphere, character) and rarely feel like scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but thematically unified around sound, vibration, and organic processes, so it seldom reads as purple for its own sake. There is minor repetition of cadence and a few near-redundant assertions of the same idea (e.g., reiterating the world’s silence and the sculpture’s grief), but not enough to drag momentum seriously. The closing image is clear and undulled by metaphorical muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is notably strong: sentences are dense with information, doing double duty for character, world, and theme without much slack. Metaphors like “like the paths of knights who never reached their destinations” and “a covenant rewriting itself in the dark” are apt and not over-mixed, and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. Rhythm alternates longer, flowing lines with shorter, pointed ones (e.g., “Your turn,” he said), giving the ending real cadence. The density of figurative language is high but remains controlled and legible, supporting rather than obscuring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, lean, and multi-functional, advancing atmosphere, character, and stakes simultaneously (e.g., “a device that hummed when it found the right frequency of quiet”). Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with silence consistently treated as texture or frequency, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There’s little to no scaffolding or repetition; each paragraph carries new pressure or image. The final cadence lands cleanly, recharging prior motifs without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are purposeful, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and meaning ("its husk pulsing faintly with the rhythm of the turning tide’s thought"). Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and internally coherent, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Momentum is steady in a lyric mode; reflection and description feel earned rather than padded. There’s minor risk of over-ornamentation, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, imagistic, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; sentences often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) simultaneously. Metaphors (e.g., arches like sleeping beasts, silence like a breath before a shout) are coherent and apt, reinforcing tone rather than competing. Momentum stays strong; description rarely stalls the scene. The main craft limitation is a slight over-clarity in thematic statements, not genuine line-level clutter or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lean yet vivid, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing plot, building atmosphere, and revealing character in one move). Rhythm varies appropriately between longer, textured descriptions and clipped action under pressure; there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Some metaphors accumulate (“howling throat,” “living thing,” “tuning fork”), but they remain coherent within the motif of sound and resonance and don’t tip into purple excess. Line-level control and clarity are strong enough for publication, even if not quite at a virtuoso level of compression.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally dense with information, doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the rhythm supports the accumulative, ceremonial feel. Imagery is mostly precise and harmonious within the sound/light/sculpture metaphor field, and there are few if any outright muddled metaphors or loops. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every line aims for lyric charge—so certain phrases (“sculpted hush,” “the world had remembered how to wonder”) start to feel slightly ornamental rather than necessary. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained through to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level writing is tight, with most sentences doing double duty (advancing action and charging theme or atmosphere) and very little scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful—metaphors like the weave fraying and the final note dissolving “like a stone dropped into deep water” clarify rather than blur. There are a couple of slightly abstract phrases (“harvest insights from his failure”) but they don’t materially slow momentum. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the piece propulsive despite its meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: imagery is generally precise, multi-functional, and rhythmically controlled, with few redundancies. Sentences often do double duty—advancing plot while reinforcing theme or atmosphere (e.g., the stars vanishing “like breath on glass” or the ink rearranging into his face). There is a high density of metaphor, but the vehicles are coherent and motif-linked (ink, stars, glass, printing), so the prose rarely tips into muddle or purple excess. A slight trimming of abstract formulations in the final third could sharpen impact further, but momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is vivid and economical for most of the piece, with strong verbs and layered images doing multiple jobs (“where memory dissolved into myth, and even the sturdiest truths thinned like mist”). Line-level clarity is high; we can track physical and conceptual shifts without confusion. The final third introduces some slogan-like repetition and abstract phrasing (“The end was a beginning… The beginning was a hum…”) that slightly dilutes the otherwise sharp texture, edging toward sentimentality. Still, there are no major loops or muddled metaphors, and momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful; images of light, frost, and vibration are well-patterned rather than cluttered. A few phrases edge toward the ornate (“the hour when assumptions shatter,” “skeleton of light”), but they don’t significantly obscure sense or slow momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, if not totally spare.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is strong: images are vivid, sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do multiple jobs (world, mood, and motion at once). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and purposeful, with only occasional near-purple edges (“rummage sale boxes of the universe”) that feel slightly writerly rather than character-driven. There are no evident paraphrase loops or structural scaffolds, and the closure image is sharply rendered. Slight trimming of metaphor density in a couple of mid-paragraph lines could further sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and generally multi-functional, often advancing world, mood, and character in a single sentence. Metaphors are mostly clean and well-chosen, and there’s minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn; momentum carries smoothly through the descent and back out. A few aphoristic lines (“Because some defiance wasn’t loud”) and near-familiar phrases (“places where the light got in”) slightly blunt the edge of originality. Overall, though, rhythm and clarity are excellent, with no real artifacts or loops dragging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: images are vivid yet mostly economical, and lines often do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding (“weight of it was wrong—not in grams, but in meaning”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or clutter; rhythm modulates well between description and key turns. There is little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony, and punctuation/grammar are clean. A small trim of a few near-aphoristic lines could sharpen impact further, but they do not materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, economical, and often do double duty (advancing image and theme simultaneously). Figurative language—“smooth as a held breath,” “stones humming like a choir of held notes”—is vivid and coherent rather than overstacked. There are no noticeable scaffold repetitions or paraphrase loops, and the final cadence is clean and earned. The piece leans lush, but control prevents it from tipping into purple or obscuring action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and mostly free of scaffolding or loops; nearly every sentence earns its place and does multiple jobs (image, atmosphere, and worldbuilding at once). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and conceptually unified around light, storms, and print, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. There’s mild risk of over-lyric saturation in places, but clarity and momentum hold, especially through the ascent and climax. Further refinement could prune a few familiar constructions (“the work was never done. That was the point.”) to avoid any sense of template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is polished: nearly every sentence does double duty for atmosphere and character, and there’s minimal scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with images (light as dye, heart as compass, wing as map) reinforcing each other rather than clashing. Rhythm on the page matches narrative needs, using crisp shocks for magical turns (“The ink *moved*.”) and more languid lines for reflection without stalling momentum. There are no obvious loops, template cadences, or figurative muddles that blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm varies naturally between long, sinuous lines and shorter anchors. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically disciplined around weight, breath, and measurement; it rarely feels ornamental. There are no significant scaffolding loops or clarity slips, and the final image is clean and resonant. Occasional metaphors (“branches heavy with stars”) edge toward familiar, but they’re recharged by context.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaning; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and story. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent, with very few mixed or strained metaphors. A handful of phrases (“golden and raw,” “like sugar in tea”) verge on familiar, and the near-constant metaphoric texture risks mild overload at elite standards, but clarity and momentum are well maintained. The closing images land cleanly without scaffold or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, high information density, and very little scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence advances either atmosphere, character, or theme. Metaphoric language (nest/egg, threshold, paradoxical book titles) is mostly coherent and mutually reinforcing rather than piled on indiscriminately. There is occasional tilt toward aphoristic abstraction (“a place that demanded stillness yet hummed…”) but it remains legible and on-voice rather than purple. No significant loops or artifacts slow momentum, though a hair more restraint in explicit paradox phrasing could further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: images like “flour once dusted the air like snow” and “the scent of yeast and wild honey unspooling like a memory” are vivid and precise without sliding into muddle. Sentences generally do multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, character, and theme—keeping momentum high for such a reflective piece. There’s minimal redundancy, and the repeated motifs (bread, coins, wheat, adjusting) feel patterned rather than looped. A few lines flirt with overt abstraction, but they remain anchored enough in image to avoid drag.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is elegant and efficient: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is rich but not incoherent; metaphors (breath as vow, vows as ghosts, library as grave) are thematically aligned and rarely feel overwrought. Rhythm varies well, with clipped beats at peaks (“A vow.” “The bridge held.”) giving impact. I see no significant loops or artifacts that stall momentum or blur sense, even under dense description.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, figurative language is vivid and largely precise, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Images like “its brass edges worn smooth by years of being clutched too tight” and “his fingers counting coins like rosary beads” do multiple jobs (character, mood, theme). The density of metaphor is high but controlled, and it rarely tips into muddle or purple. A slight trim of explanatory phrasing in the final reflection could sharpen momentum even further.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and inventive, with strong information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, world-building, and character simultaneously. Metaphoric language is frequent but largely coherent (“terrestrially cosmic,” “space between stars”) and pattern-consistent, avoiding mixed or nonsensical images. There’s mild risk of saturation, yet momentum holds and there are no obvious paraphrase loops or scaffolding artifacts. The final images (“gravity itself had decided to lean into the future,” “the compass had never been broken”) are sharp and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is lean enough for a lyric mode; almost every sentence carries either character, atmosphere, or thematic weight with minimal scaffolding. Sentence rhythms vary and are often purposefully patterned (e.g., “The first… The second… By the third…”) to mirror emotional intensification. Some metaphors and abstractions (“uncorked something feral and bright,” “half-living”) flirt with purple or familiar territory, but they remain clear and do not obscure causality or the closure image. There are no evident loops, syntactic glitches, or filter-verb stacks that materially sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and purposeful: most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, or character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but thematically unified (ink, leaves, breath, toxins), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum through the descent and quiet the cadence appropriately at the ending. I see no significant artifacts or loops that dull clarity, and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, character) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm breathes well with the scene’s emotional contour. Figurative language is generally apt and coherent, with no major mixed metaphors or syntactic artifacts. There is a high density of metaphor and abstraction in places that edges toward purple, and a few near-repetitions of idea (“the world didn’t need more noise… needed more wonder”) could be trimmed. Still, momentum and clarity remain strong, and the closure image is clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense but disciplined, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once. Metaphors are original and coherent, and repetition (static, hum, pull) is purposeful rather than looped scaffold. Line-level clarity is high; the sequence of actions around the burn and the box is easy to follow despite lyricism. At a top-market level, one could trim a couple of nearly-synonymous phrases, but there’s no real momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely tight, musical, and multi-functional, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character ("the kind of quiet that comes before a revelation"). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and on-theme, and there is little to no scaffolding, synonym churn, or obvious loops. A few similes verge on the familiar or slightly purple ("like a slow exhale," "like a half-remembered secret"), but they don’t meaningfully drag momentum or cloud sense. Syntax varies, rhythm breathes with the scene, and the final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density: many sentences do double duty, advancing action and atmosphere simultaneously (“each gesture a line of code, each pause a semicolon”). Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and rhythm varies well across paragraphs. There are few to no paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases; momentum holds from start to finish. A handful of lines lean toward purple or overtly declarative insight, but they don’t materially obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, lean, and do multiple jobs—advancing plot, building atmosphere, and carrying theme without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is vivid yet mostly controlled (“time itself had frozen mid-drip,” “gravity pooled like ink in water”), and there are no significant loops or template cadences that stall momentum. The prose does approach density in places, flirting with purple but not quite crossing into muddle, and a few intensifiers could be pruned without loss. Overall, clarity, rhythm, and propulsion remain high through the climax and closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and motion) and the prose mostly avoids redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, producing a sustained lyric texture rather than random ornamentation. Here and there the density edges toward purple (e.g., “terrestrially cosmic tension,” “tranquil blaze”) but it doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image. Read-aloud rhythm is varied, and key beats (“Then—snap.”) are clean and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: few words feel wasted, and many sentences carry multiple loads (image, world rule, and emotional cue). Figurative language is fresh and largely coherent to the world (“the sky wrote in fire,” “the brownstone exhaled”), with only a couple of slightly dense spots that flirt with purple without crossing the line. There’s no obvious scaffolding, synonym loops, or clunky exposition; rhythm modulates well between contemplative and sharp beats. A tiny trim of modifiers in one or two metaphoric lines could sharpen momentum even more.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that mostly deepen rather than blur (“petals blackened…then silvered, as if burned by something brighter than fire”). The lyricism is sustained without falling into obvious loops or scaffold; each paragraph tends to add new pressure or texture. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent, and momentum is preserved even in reflective lines. A few intensified phrases (“translate isolation into independence,” “light that outlasted the stealing dark”) brush against abstraction, mildly tempering the otherwise excellent control.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence carries character, atmosphere, or theme. Metaphors (ink as wound, stalactites as regret, signature as noose/cradle) are coherent and reinforce one another rather than clashing. There is a mild leaning toward purple in the density of figurative language, but clarity remains intact and the rhythm never bogs down. No obvious loops, syntax templates, or line-level artifacts disrupt momentum, especially at the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density—most lines do double duty in advancing atmosphere and concept. Imagery is vivid and generally controlled (“walls coiled like a sleeping viper,” “groan of a bridge holding too much weight”) without slipping into mixed metaphors or obscuring clarity. There is a mild tendency toward purple abstraction in places, but it rarely stalls momentum or clouds sense. No noticeable scaffolding, loops, or technical errors mar the climax or ending, keeping closure crisp on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and images that usually do double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and non-redundant; metaphors like “purest things rising… like air from a drowned man’s lungs” are visceral and on-point. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose carries momentum despite its lyricism. Only occasional near-aphorisms risk feeling familiar, but they don’t materially blur clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, layered images, and high information density with little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors like the whisk’s tines as “legs of a startled spider” and grooves as “a record of unseen labor” are vivid and apt. A few phrases (“scintillatingly somber”) flirt with over-lushness but don’t materially obscure meaning or momentum. Overall, prose propels rather than stalls, and the closing lines compress theme and image without syntactic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: vivid yet controlled description, minimal redundancy, and sentences that often do double duty (worldbuilding plus mood or character). Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and the prose maintains momentum through the climax into the elliptical aftermath. Phrases like "her body dissolving into the same static that hummed in the air" and "not broken, but refracted" are evocative without being muddy. A touch of purple texture in places, but nothing that materially obscures action or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character while maintaining clarity. Metaphor use is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (bones of mountains/gods, glass as lens/door/throne), avoiding mixed or baffling imagery. Sentence rhythms vary enough to sustain momentum; there’s minimal redundancy or scaffold. A slight tendency toward purple flourish in places doesn’t materially obscure cause and effect or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: images like “residue of captured sounds” and “ink the color of storm clouds” do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and thematically apt, with minimal redundancy or scaffold sentences. A few phrases (“positively wistful,” “lonesome splendor”) flirt with lushness, yet they do not obscure sense or slow momentum meaningfully. Syntax is clean, with no noticeable loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity errors at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, character, atmosphere) with little to no scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose reads clean aloud. Metaphors are coherent and thematically unified around sound, ice, and light; there’s no noticeable synonym churn or template cadence. The density of figurative language occasionally edges toward saturation, especially in the climax, but it doesn’t tip into confusion or obscuring causality. A touch more variation between plainer and highly figurative lines could give individual images even more punch.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are precise, frequently doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and figurative language is both fresh and coherent (“a bridge to nowhere and everywhere”). Repetition (“It was a pause. / A held breath.”; “The revolution would not…”) feels intentional and rhythmic rather than like scaffold. There are no noticeable loops, strained metaphors, or syntactic glitches, and the prose sustains momentum despite its reflective lean. The only minor limitation is that a few thesis-like lines flatten the otherwise textural subtlety, preventing this from quite reaching the very topmost tier.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, and most carry multiple functions (atmosphere, character, and plot) without bloat. Figurative language—“city’s veins,” “constellation of forgotten stars”—is vivid but not so dense that it muddies clarity, and there are no real paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. Rhythm tracks the beat shifts well, tightening as Elias discovers the wall and water. A few metaphors lean familiar, and trimming one or two explanatory tags would increase concision and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences pull double duty for image and theme, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent, with recurring motifs (confession, light through cracks, storm) rather than grab-bag metaphors. A few formulations verge on familiar or slightly purple, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image. Momentum is maintained despite reflective passages, and transitions between beats are smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without bloating. Imagery stays coherent to the metal/acid/mechanical vocabulary, and metaphors rarely conflict or overstack. A few favored words (“transliterate,” “yearning algorithm”) recur, but as intentional motifs rather than artifacts, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The climax and ending remain clear despite lyric compression, which is crucial at this density.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are generally sharp, and most lines carry more than one layer of work (worldbuilding plus mood plus character). The recurring phrase “echo of forgotten songs” and a few expository clarifications edge toward mild redundancy, but not enough to drag momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled and coherent with the cosmic-digital aesthetic. There are no evident loops, scaffolding artifacts, or syntactic glitches that obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: sentences are varied, images carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme), and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors like “caught the light like trapped screams” and “the light itself hesitated to claim him” are striking and mostly coherent with the world’s tone. The prose occasionally edges toward lushness, but it doesn’t significantly impede clarity or momentum. Final lines (“space between seeing and doing,” “mirrors shattered behind him, their glimpses finally whole”) land cleanly with reconfigured meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences are doing multiple jobs (world, mood, and character) with good rhythm control and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is generally precise and thematically apt (“silence…like a held breath,” “trawling for meaning”). There is a slight tendency toward over-articulated wisdom lines in the final third, which flirts with purple or didactic (“solace wasn’t something you chased”), softening the impact of the otherwise sharp imagery. Overall, momentum remains intact and clarity is high.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: images are coherent, sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, character), and there’s good rhythmic variation. Figurative density is high but mostly purposeful—“taillights dissolving into the violet dusk like embers” and “knife left in the rain” both land cleanly rather than muddling sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping, and the closure image is crisp. A slight tendency toward lushness in calmer stretches keeps it just below the top band for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do multiple jobs (advancing scene, deepening world, and carrying theme). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically apt; images of breath, murmurs, and edges accumulate rather than clutter. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the rhythm suits a meditative yet pressured scene. At times the density of metaphor edges toward purple, but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for mood and theme (“The wind carried the scent of crushed lavender and old iron”). Repetition of certain formulations about healing and pain borders on over-explicit but doesn’t become structurally redundant. Figurative language is mostly coherent and grounded; the rare extended metaphor (vines as stitches, photos as constellations) lands cleanly. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece, with no major scaffold or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences carry atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally clean and coherent (the root/underground metaphor is sustained rather than muddled), and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Sentence rhythm varies well, giving lyric lift without sacrificing clarity or momentum. A few lines verge on aphoristic abstraction, but they don’t significantly blur sense or stall the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are vivid yet largely coherent, and most lines carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) without bloat. Figurative language is dense but patterned and thematically aligned (bones, static, sea, tape), so it reads as intentional texture rather than purple excess. There are no obvious loops, synonym churn, or clotted metaphors that impede clarity, and the final cadence (“like a tape rewinding”) lands cleanly. A few high-intensity lines stack similes closely, but they don’t materially slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme. There is some tendency toward purple abstraction and epigrammatic repetition in the latter third, where insights are named rather than fully dramatized. Nonetheless, clarity remains high; there are no significant loops, syntactic artifacts, or figurative muddles that obscure action or closure. The final cadence is strong, even if a touch over-insistent in its philosophical framing.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for mood and character. A few metaphors (“pulsing stillness,” “hope shifted from a flame to a scent”) risk mild purple layering, but they remain coherent and thematically aligned rather than muddled. There’s good rhythmic variation and minimal scaffold or redundancy; line-level clarity is never in doubt. The final images (the shard falling, the lemon soap, the harp lifted again) land cleanly without figurative noise.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, few redundancies, and metaphors that mostly pull their weight while maintaining clarity. Key phrases like “The key wasn’t just a tool; it was a loop left unclosed” and “a library of sealed doors, each humming with the weight of a thousand unasked questions” do multiple jobs at once (world, theme, mood). There are minor echoes in structure and a slight density of grand abstractions near the end (“shape of hunger,” “things that answered back”), but they don’t muddy causality or the closure image. Overall momentum is well-maintained with little scaffold or fluff.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, imagery is vivid yet generally economical, and most lines do double duty advancing scene and mood. Metaphors are precise and thematically cohesive (bones, cracks, doors, constellations), with little redundancy or scaffolding. A few formulations skate close to the poetic-over-concrete edge, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. The prose maintains momentum throughout, with no visible loops, template cadences, or clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, with many metaphors (“sleeping serpent,” “breath of the tide,” “trapped storm of green and gold”) that mostly cohere and build atmosphere rather than muddling sense. Sentence rhythm varies well; there’s little scaffolding or repetition, and each paragraph carries new emotional or imagistic information. That said, figurative density is high enough that in a few spots it skirts purple, and a bit more spareness around peak beats might sharpen impact. Line-level control is nonetheless strong and well above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and purposeful, with figurative language that is vivid but mostly unstrained (“cathedral of moss,” “honeyed hush,” “bonfire…embers”). Information density is high—nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme—and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. The final paragraphs in particular braid image and meaning with precision, reusing earlier details (icicle patterns, moss) without looping. Occasionally the prose edges toward lushness, but it never tips into muddle or significantly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and often striking (“vivid as knife wounds,” “voice like pages turning”), with good information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some risk of purple repetition in the concentration of metaphors about water, ink, and currents, but the pattern is clear enough to read as motif rather than muddle. A few lines veer toward slogan (“not good enough, not true enough”; “you never let us breathe”) and the thematic final sentence feels slightly didactic compared to the subtler imagery before it. Still, line-level rhythm, variation, and clarity remain strong throughout, with no major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“painting the air in liquid gold,” “wrinkled like forgotten wishes”) and generally high information density—most lines do multiple jobs. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; only occasionally does it veer toward familiar sentiment (“the world felt whole”) without undermining clarity. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. Not quite razor-honed at every turn, but comfortably above the bar for elite-market readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are fresh (“her spine curved like a bridge,” “breath curling like smoke”) and multi-functional, advancing setting, mood, and character. There is high figurative density but it remains legible and tonally unified rather than purple, with minimal redundancy. Sentences propel rather than stall, and transitions between beats are clean. A few formulations lean toward ornamental (“like the first note of a song you’ve waited lifetimes to hear”), but they do not obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense yet efficient, with most lines doing double or triple duty (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and very little scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and patterned (cellars, harvests, silver, echoes), and it intensifies meaning instead of obscuring it. Sentence rhythm supports momentum and pause; key beats are allowed to land cleanly without being overwritten. I see no loops, template cadences, or artifacts that dull the closure image; the final paragraph, in particular, is sharply cut and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (image, world, emotion), and rarely feel redundant. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and thematically aligned (calcification, sediment, metal, sea), and it doesn’t obscure basic sense or causality. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or mechanical cadences; the prose feels deliberately composed rather than templated. A few metaphors edge toward the ornate (“whalebone reverie”) but they remain legible and productive rather than purple.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, dense, and mostly economical—lines typically do double duty for atmosphere and character (“a scent that clung to her clothes like a second skin”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images of glass, smoke, wood, and time crystallization cohere rather than feeling like piled-on ornament. There are no significant loops, syntactic monotony, or clarity issues, and the final paragraphs land with a clean, charged image. A few abstractions (“language of absence,” “hauntingly practical rhythm”) flirt with over-lyricism but don’t materially blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are lean yet layered, and most images pull double duty for setting and theme (“its film long exposed to the wrong kind of light”). There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; paragraphs generally introduce new pressure or texture rather than restating. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few, if any, mixed metaphors; phrases like “time had frayed like the hem of her coat” feel apt and grounded. A tiny number of abstractions (“a chorus of regret”) could be rendered more concretely, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and multi-functional—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (“The flows weren’t just water. / The carnival had siphoned more than credits…”). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, with few if any mixed metaphors or redundancies, and the syntax varies enough to sustain momentum. A couple of conceptual phrases (“maze of intentions,” “failed equation”) flirt with abstraction, but they’re anchored quickly in concrete action so they don’t materially blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing action, character, and atmosphere simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent, and while it occasionally skirts the edge of purple, it does not muddle meaning or stall momentum. There is little evident scaffolding or repetition; the progression of images from stillness to fracture to released sound reads cleanly aloud. A touch more variation—letting a few images land without adornment—could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and economical: sentences usually do double duty for atmosphere and character, and there’s little to no redundant scaffolding or synonym churn. Metaphors are generally coherent and purposeful, with only a few slightly familiar constructions (“like a blade through old parchment”) that don’t impede clarity or momentum. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative sentences and shorter, decisive ones near the ending choices. There are no significant line-level artifacts or loops that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is high: sentences are dense yet generally precise, metaphors are coherent (“a braided ledger of tides and tempests”), and most lines do multiple jobs (world, mood, and character). There’s minimal scaffold or synonym churn; the prose flows without obvious loops or filler. The figurative load is heavy but controlled, supporting the accumulative, mythic mode without tipping into full purple excess. Minor moments of lushness might be pared for even sharper momentum, but they don’t materially dull clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally high: sentences are musical, varied enough in structure, and dense with meaning, and images like “the sky was a bruise of violet and ash” land cleanly. There is some risk of overwriting—stacked abstractions and aphoristic turns—but they rarely blur sense or stall momentum. Redundancies are minimal; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme simultaneously. Tightening a few near-duplicate thematic statements would push this into a more rarefied band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and images like the egg “remembering itself” or glass wings “throwing fractured rainbows” are memorable. There is some over-saturation of figurative language and repeated emotional modifiers (“bitter-sweet ache,” “bitter aftertaste of hope”) that edge toward purple and could be pruned for even greater impact. Despite the density, clarity of action and emotional beats never quite suffers. Tightening a handful of metaphors and trimming redundancy would move this into true top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense; almost every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, with motifs (fire, ash, kelp, obsidian, song) repeating in a controlled way instead of tumbling into purple prose. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and there are no grammatical slips or clarity failures. A few metaphors (e.g., “migration of clouds”) approach decorative, but they’re integrated enough not to drag pace.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: figurative language is frequent but mostly apt, and sentences tend to pull multiple weights (world, character, theme) at once. There’s very little scaffolding or redundancy; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes. The prose flirts with purple at times but rarely tips over, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. No structural artifacts or muddled metaphors significantly obscure sense, including in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong image-making (“petals of ionized gas,” “a bridge of resonating light”) and good information density—most sentences do more than one job. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors are largely consistent with the story’s physics and mood. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final lines land cleanly without clutter. It verges on purple in spots, which slightly dulls momentum, but not enough to harm clarity or the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich—“hues of bruised violet,” “veined with starlight,” “wings whispering…like pages turning”—yet the figurative language remains coherent and aligned with the story’s motifs (stone, breath, books, weather). Sentences mostly pull double duty, advancing mood and meaning together, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. There’s a mild risk of over-lyricism, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or stall momentum, especially since the piece is fundamentally meditative. Line-level control at the ending (“door,” “unspooling toward the future”) is particularly strong and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme) with little redundancy, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Metaphors are largely coherent and thematically aligned (tide as erasure, weights as guilt), avoiding mixed or strained imagery. There’s a high figurative density, but it feels like an intentional lyric mode rather than purple drift, and momentum is preserved across the scene. I see no obvious scaffold, synonym loops, or clarity-breaking artifacts, especially in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “roots whispering secrets to the dead” and knots that “breathed” are fresh and coherent, and most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and story. Figurative density is high but not gratuitous; metaphors are thematically aligned (threads, bones, roots) and avoid muddle. There’s little to no scaffold, synonym churn, or paraphrase looping; progression is efficient despite the lyricism. A tiny trim of modifiers in a couple of spots could sharpen impact further, but momentum and clarity remain intact to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple jobs, imagery is mostly precise, and rhythm varies well. The opening in particular is tight and high-impact, with almost every line advancing both image and concept. In the back half, there’s some conceptual redundancy and slight purple-leaning abstraction, as similar ideas about innovation, possibility, and listening are reiterated in essay-like phrases. These are refinements rather than structural problems, but they keep the prose from entering truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is tight and musical, with imagery that is rich but controlled; metaphors tend to be precise and thematically aligned (mist “thick as regret,” dust trying “to speak”). Sentences vary rhythmically, and nearly every line does multiple jobs—advancing mood, character, and world at once—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. The final paragraphs in particular are clean and potent, landing strong images without over-explaining. Lushness never tips into muddle or redundancy, even under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, dense, and image-driven, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful (e.g., powder as “first snow on a grave,” mask shards as “bones settling”), without obvious mixed metaphors. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; rhythm supports the slow, charged unfolding. The main risk is proximity to purple prose, but control and clarity keep it on the right side of that line.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, character, theme) without feeling padded, and rhythm varies effectively between long, sinuous description and sharp dialogue tags. Metaphors are mostly precise and thematically apt (ribs of the sunken city, water as “mocking applause”), with no noticeable mixed or strained figures. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or pressure. The closing sentences are especially clean and potent, with the clerk’s flat report and the cog “ticking” landing as an efficient cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is high: images like “stained-glass windows bleeding amber across the shelves like slow fire” and “autumn stripped the trees with deliberate patience” are vivid but still legible and thematically apt. There’s a dense use of metaphor, yet it remains coherent and multipurpose rather than decorative clutter, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding phrases. Syntax varies nicely between long, sinuous sentences and clipped closure beats, supporting the contemplative but forward-moving rhythm. A touch less metaphor stacking in one or two sentences would make it pristine, but as-is it’s fully publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and economical: images like “silence—thick and warm as rising dough” and “rusted into lace” do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character filter, theme) without bloat. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, and there’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony. The closing cadence is strong and ties back to earlier motifs (sweetness, ruins, growth) with clarity. At times the density of metaphor approaches the edge of purple, but it does not impede readability or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, figurative language is vivid and mostly controlled, and nearly every line does double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme). There are a few near-repetitions and slightly on-the-nose formulations, but no real scaffolding or synonym loops. The final paragraph in particular has a clean, satisfying cadence that recharges earlier motifs (bridge, sunrise, wildness). No figurative muddle or register drift interferes with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are generally apt and controlled (e.g., the cello note, a house feeling like it’s breathing), and there is little scaffolding or synonym churn. There are moments of near-redundancy or slight over-explanation of already-implied ideas, especially around the thematic statements of “hush.” Overall, it reads as ready or near-ready at an elite level with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and thematically unified (pressure, cracks, planting, drowning), avoiding mixed or confusing metaphors. Prose propels rather than stalls; nearly every line advances character, revelation, or atmosphere. It veers toward purple at moments, but restraint around the climax and closure image keeps clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, precise, and economical, with very little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent with the conceptual frame (proof, recursion, texture) rather than decorative. The rhythm tightens appropriately around key beats (the dice throw, the sideways leap, the hand on the door) without becoming choppy. A couple of lines lean toward slogan (“The pain was a anchor.” / “Perpetual motion wasn’t a failure. It was a choice.”), but they don’t materially blunt clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose shows high information density: most sentences carry atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously, and figurative language (coin-like moon, laughter as a struck bell) is vivid yet legible. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding repetitions; rhythm and paragraphing support the piece’s “saffron quiet” without dragging. Metaphors remain coherent and aligned with the established world, avoiding purple excess even at peak lyricism. Line-level work would require minimal, if any, revision for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-by-line, the prose is tight, musical, and information-dense: most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and emotional charge. Metaphors (steam kneaded into dough, lichen like old regret, the roar dissolving names) are coherent and thematically aligned rather than piled on for ornament. Rhythm varies nicely; there are no obvious repetition loops, template cadences, or filter-verb clutter that stall momentum. It stops short of the very top band because figurative density is consistently high, and a few lines verge on “one more image” where slightly plainer phrasing might have increased force.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, purposeful, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and plot. Metaphor and imagery are striking and mostly coherent, and key beats are rendered in clean, muscular lines (“The mechanism groaned, then sang—a sound like a thousand clocks unwinding at once”). There is some purple creep—stacked descriptors and thematic restatements near the end (“Still spinning. / Still falling. / Still initiate.”) that edge toward decorative rather than necessary. The density never quite obscures causality or closure, but a bit more pruning would move this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are vivid yet usually multi-functional (atmosphere, character, and theme), and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and motif-linked (light, negatives, breathing mirrors), and action beats like the lunge and unbosoming are cleanly staged. The occasional metaphor edges toward overextended or cute (the bed/sheets line, “dawn broke like a bruise” as a familiar simile), tonally nudging against the otherwise razor-sharp freshness. These are minor slips; momentum and clarity remain high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the piece is tight and musical: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) without evident padding, and the read-aloud rhythm is strong. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and sensorially grounded; images like the “cloud-hand” or “sound bloomed like a bruise” are striking yet clear. There are no real template cadences, paraphrase loops, or clotted explanatory scaffolds. The density of imagery lightly approaches purple in places but does not materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is strong, with high information density and very little scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence earns its place. Recurring images (cracks, breath, patterns, the whistle) are handled with discipline rather than over-insistence, and short standalone sentences are used effectively for emphasis. There is a mild tendency toward repeated abstract nouns (“patterns,” “languages”) that could be grounded a touch more in tactile sensation, but clarity never suffers. No major artifacts, loops, or mixed metaphors blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, image-rich without tipping into confusion, and generally do multiple jobs (setting, mood, theme) at once. There is a high metaphor density (rosebush as surrender flag, ivy strangling iron bones, the B as sun), but the vehicles are coherent and thematically aligned rather than decorative clutter. Momentum never stalls in exposition or repetition, and there are no noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences. The final lines ("Some things couldn’t be buried twice... Elias followed them into the dark") deliver a crisp, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are precise (“ink the color of dried violets,” “iron teeth locking the past in place”) and most sentences carry more than one function (image, character, or theme). The lyricism largely avoids purple excess, with only occasional abstractions (“interlaced absence,” “hushed blaze”) that remain intelligible. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the paragraphs move cleanly and keep momentum for this reflective mode. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to sustain interest without calling undue attention to themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely clean, rhythmic, and efficient: most sentences do double duty in evoking mood and advancing action, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or synonym loops. Metaphors (“like a blind man reading braille,” “the ghost of a touch”) are apt and not overstacked, avoiding purple excess despite a consistently lyrical register. Paragraphs are well segmented to mark turns—from investigation to exploration to realization—supporting momentum. A harsher editorial pass might trim a couple of near-redundant lines about stillness and noise, but nothing significantly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and imagery that usually clarifies rather than obscures (“peeling back her skin to show the dream-stuff beneath”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and well-chosen, with purposeful repetitions (“unfolding,” dreams as physical substance) rather than loose synonym churn. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and the final third lands on clean, resonant images. There is a mild risk of over-saturation—almost every sentence is stylized—which might benefit from a few plainer lines to give the metaphors more contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images are vivid, sentences carry multiple jobs, and rhythm modulates well between exposition and peak moments. There is some density of figurative language, but most metaphors land cleanly and suit the tone; they rarely feel mixed or overwrought. Minor redundancy around “potential” and “hunting” appears, yet doesn’t materially slow momentum or blur closure. Syntax and mechanics are clean, with no obvious scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, images precise (“indigo bruise of the sky”), and almost every line carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Refrains like “missing pieces” and “brilliant dimness” feel intentional rather than repetitive, and the prose mostly avoids redundancy or scaffold. A few phrases flirt with purple or conceptual abstraction (“decode the frequency of belonging”), but they’re anchored enough in concrete action to maintain momentum. There are no noticeable grammatical or sequencing slips to obscure causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, and character) with clear syntax and a varied rhythm that suits the contemplative pressure. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and coherent, with only occasional edges into purple without breaking clarity. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, theme, or character. The density of metaphor in places slightly risks over-saturation, which keeps it shy of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence rhythms and images that typically do more than one job (advancing mood, theme, and character simultaneously). Metaphors like the moon “at half-mast” and the chasm where forgiveness/apology drown are vivid without becoming incoherent or tangled. A few phrases approach density (“the timeframe between apology and forgiveness”) but they remain legible and do not stall momentum. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty, advancing character and atmosphere with tight, evocative images (“blue that swallowed apologies whole,” “map of scars”). The tidal/astronomical metaphors are generally coherent and on-theme; a few approach density saturation but rarely obscure clarity or momentum. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the closure image is crisp and cleanly delivered. A minor tightening of metaphor frequency in mid-story would move this toward truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are agile, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and plot (“the city’s pulse muted to a distant hum, like a heart behind too many ribs”). Figurative language is vivid but mostly controlled, and there’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or template cadence. The closing images (trash bin newspaper, quiet chess move, unseen baseball rolling) are sharp and economical. A handful of metaphors skate close to the lyrical-heavy side, but they don’t materially blur clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and minimal redundancy; most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without bloat. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (stars, spices, roots, fire), avoiding mixed or strained metaphors. There are no obvious scaffold phrases, synonym loops, or cadence templates that sap momentum, and the prose remains clear even at its most lush. The final paragraph in particular lands cleanly without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but largely precise, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“the air smelled of damp earth and something older—like the slow unraveling of regret”). Line-level rhythm varies well, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; the piece moves steadily toward its climax. Some metaphors pile up (“clouds below churned like restless ghosts,” “ink… as a starless sky”), occasionally risking purple overload, but they do not obscure sense or closure. Syntax, grammar, and sequencing are clean, and the final image is crisp rather than overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but largely disciplined: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and image) without collapsing into muddle. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically linked (bones, stitches, breath, weight), and there are few if any true redundancy loops. Momentum is maintained despite lyricism; the attempt-failure-try-again spine ensures forward motion. The only reason this doesn’t edge higher is that the sustained metaphorical intensity occasionally risks saturation where a simpler line might bite harder.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid yet mostly precise (“lava kiss the sea and turn to stone,” “glass vials lined up like a constellation”), and sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; each line tends to earn its place, and momentum is maintained despite a lyric pace. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (light, fire, hush, tide, coincidence), avoiding mixed metaphors or mush. A tiny trim of adjectival density in one or two sentences would sharpen impact, but it doesn’t significantly impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary rhythmically, imagery is generally clean, and most lines do double duty for mood, character, and world. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors (lantern fort, cradle of sparks, drawn bowstring) support the central motifs rather than piling up randomly. There’s little evident scaffolding or redundancy; exposition about the sundial and ledgers is concise and well-placed. A slight density of “elevated” images in a few spots edges toward purple but doesn’t materially slow momentum or blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but mostly high-functioning: images are vivid, multi-tasking for atmosphere and theme, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; metaphors stay internally consistent and rarely feel mixed or purple. Sentence rhythm varies well between long lyric arcs and clipped emphasis around beats like “The dust at her feet shivered” and “The mirror-water shattered.” Momentum holds through the climax, with no obvious loops or line-level artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, syntactically varied, and dense with images that mostly do multiple jobs (character, theme, and setting at once). The repeated metaphoric reach (sky as ocean, clouds as censored line, body as atlas) edges toward saturation but remains internally consistent rather than muddled. There are no evident scaffolding loops or clarity breaks; momentum is preserved despite the lyricism. A bit more sparingness in figurative language would push this into truly top-tier line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and cadence, images are precise (“hummed with the quiet insistence of a brook,” needle card spinning like a coin), and almost every line advances either action, world, or theme. The prose occasionally skirts purple but stays coherent and purposeful, with metaphors aligned to water, light, and measurement rather than a random grab-bag. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or muddled metaphors, and the final paragraphs land with clear, clean images. A bit of pruning in the densest descriptive moments could make the rhythm even more propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are varied, images are clear, and most metaphors cohere and pull double duty for mood and theme. The piece maintains momentum despite being quiet, with very little scaffolding or redundant phrasing. There is a high density of figurative language—blooming, wounds, hearts, vines, light through cracks—that risks slight over-lushness but largely stays controlled and legible. A touch more restraint in the final third would sharpen the strongest images rather than competing with them.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding or repetition, and figurative language (“wind hummed… like a half-remembered tune”) is both apt and clean. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and key beats—threading the reel, stepping through the door, the clock chiming—are rendered with clarity and focus. There’s some density of metaphor, but it rarely tips into purple or confusion and generally supports the story’s musical/time-obsessed lens. I see no major artifacts or loops that would impede immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is taut, image-rich, and generally avoids redundancy; most lines do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Metaphors are original and largely coherent with the world’s logic, and sentence rhythm varies to support both contemplative and climactic beats. There is some density of figurative language (“tasted like silence,” “first question ever asked,” “ridge’s empirical whimsy”) that edges toward lush, but it does not blur sense or stall momentum. I see no significant scaffolding, loops, or syntactic artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with figurative language that largely remains coherent and relevant to the emotional arc. Repetition (“The tides would keep coming. / So would the memories.”) is purposeful and pattern-taught rather than an artifact, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. A few metaphors flirt with lushness, but they don’t stray into muddle or obscure causality. Overall momentum is well maintained for a reflective piece, with no dead paragraphs.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but occasionally dense with mixed metaphors (a building with "ribs" and "teeth" in the same sentence). The phrase "preprocessed reality" clashes with the poetic tone, reading as jargon that explains rather than demonstrates the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally obscures logic. The core simile—"Truth, like glass, was clearer when broken"—is physically counterintuitive (fractures typically obscure clarity), sacrificing precision for sound. The reliance on abstract phrasing ("illusion that purpose was something you could melt") slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but repetitive in structure, relying heavily on negational definitions ("It wasn’t X. It was Y.") to generate significance. The use of "fingers bleeding" is a stock image that detracts from the otherwise inventive magical descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally dips into purple phrasing ("slow burn of a held breath," "salt and sorrow"). These moments reduce the sharpness of the imagery, but the closing lines are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("like water wearing down stone," "flames licked," "dying man's last breath") and strained metaphors (clutching a breath; thorns sharp as promises). The reliance on single-sentence paragraphs creates a melodramatic, artificial cadence that substitutes for genuine rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.5)
    While grammatically sound, the prose suffers from a density of abstract metaphors ("voice the sound of petals unfurling") that obscures physical reality. The reliance on "purple" phrasing ("whisper rather than shine") distances the reader from the concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative but leans toward the melodramatic, heavily relying on italics for emphasis (*shuddered*, *through*, *when*) which creates a "shouting" effect. Phrasing occasionally drifts into purple prose ("quaking reverie," "pulsing like veins") that reduces line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the prose is polished, the mechanics of the climax are opaque; it is unclear how striking a piano key drops a guard standing elsewhere. The writing occasionally prioritizes poetic flourish over physical clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is density-rich but occasionally overwritten with heavy metaphor ("glass panes sagged like held breath"). The "cells in his bones divided" line is a jarring prompt insertion that disrupts the scene's rhythm, and the "And Elias?" rhetorical structure at the end feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose structure is excessively fragmented, with over 50 paragraphs for a short piece, creating a "scrolling text" cadence that destroys literary density. While individual images are pretty, the reliance on sentence fragments and vertical spacing substitutes for genuine syntactic rhythm and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong rhythm and sound work ("hissed through the pipes," "held note finally released"). However, metaphor density is high ("breath a fleeting sculpture," "sun fracture into questions"), occasionally prioritizing poetic effect over immediate clarity in the final beat. The writing is evocative but risks becoming slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is functional but heavy on adjectives and similes ("groaned beneath the weight," "sagging like old bones"). The use of the cliché "cracks that let the light in" detracts from the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is marred by severe syntactic repetition; the construction "the way [noun] [verb]" appears at least seven times ("the way others hoarded," "the way a shore holds," "the way it pooled," etc.), creating a noticeable scaffold. Additionally, the phrase "ambered hush" is repeated three times in a short space, diminishing its effect.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is rhythmically competent but suffers from a high density of clichés ("practiced ease," "dying light," "shattered into a thousand fragments," "ghost of a fire"). The phrasing often summarizes emotional states ("something akin to reverence") rather than evoking them through fresh imagery or action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from high metaphorical density and "purple" tendencies ("shrug dissolving into the hush," "whisper of light"). Fragmentary sentences ("Not words. Not lies.") are used repetitively for unearned emphasis. The style prioritizes poetic affect over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and readable, but suffers from "simile density," with nearly every description relying on a "like" comparison. The rhythm is somewhat repetitive (short paragraph stacks), creating a template cadence that reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with strong verbs ("leaned," "spilled") and effective rhythm. Some phrasing leans into genre clichés ("fingers that remembered," "not dead... elsewhen"), and the "mechanically warm" descriptor feels slightly repetitive in this short space.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control ("lapped like a slow, patient tongue"). A few filter verbs ("Elias understood") distance the reader from the realization beat, but the line-level craft is otherwise polished and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though it occasionally teeters on overwriting with pathetic fallacy ("ribs groaning," "sorrowful glow") and metaphor stacking. The density mostly serves the atmosphere, but a few metaphors draw attention to themselves rather than the moment ("unspool itself," "bleeding into stems").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and evocative, but there is a noticeable reliance on simile structures ("like a sleeping beast," "like bones," "like thin ice," "like a molared jaw," "like burnt sugar," "like a seam," "like rosary stones"). While individually strong, the repetitive "X like Y" syntactic pattern creates a slight template cadence that draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, though occasional filter verbs ("saw," "felt") and passive constructions slightly dampen immediacy. Some phrases lean toward the generic ("untold seasons," "grip on reality"), but the descriptions of the origami and the refuge are sharp and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from a heavy "simile scaffold," with nearly every description relying on a comparison ("like a secret," "like a tuning fork," "like a metronome," "like a vine," "like a breath"). This repetitive cadence creates a predictable rhythm that dulls the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is lush but frequently overwrought ("unspooling fire," "maw," "shuddered"), leading to density issues. The mandatory phrase "sensitively perceptive fingers" creates a jarring adverb-adjective cluster that disrupts the rhythm and reads as artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with some striking imagery, but the rhythm suffers from a staccato reliance on short paragraphs and repetitive sentence stems ("Chen didn't...", "He took...", "He knew..."). The "heavier than soy sauce" metaphor is inventive, but expository definitions of the protagonist's actions slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from dense, abstract metaphors ("noose of understanding," "color of understanding") that obscure sensory clarity. The reliance on synesthesia borders on incoherence in peak beats, and the repetition of abstract nouns ("stillness," "silence") creates drag.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("unzip itself from the dark"), with strong rhythm. A minor spatial ambiguity regarding the courier's location (intercom vs. knock echoing up) slightly blurs the physical blocking, but the line-level craft is otherwise polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the rhythm is generally strong, the prose suffers from mixed metaphors (rain clinging to air "like a second skin") and forced oxymorons ("darkening brightness"). Additionally, a noticeable typo in the climax ("He had retrace not the path") and the jarring insertion of technical jargon ("procedural generation") disrupts the immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, but suffers from forced poetic phrasings like "audibly muted" and "filament of hush" that draw attention to themselves. The metaphorical stacking in the final paragraph ("numbness... wall... door") feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. A few similes lean toward the melodramatic ("like a blade through silk," "like a second heartbeat"), but the technical description of the recorder and the knot work creates a convincing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and sensory-rich, but relies on stock phrases at peak moments ("hit him like a blade," "laugh, bitter and soft"). The line "The transformation was complete" is a "telling" artifact that flattens a pivotal beat. Rhythm is generally good, but the "template cadence" of noun-verb imagery is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    While rhythmic and polished, the prose relies on several clichés ("oil on water," "sins too heavy to hold") and abstract phrasing that reduces impact. The final line logically contradicts the physical actions (carving, sleeping) shown earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished with strong sensory density ("air tasted of metal," "ribs of forgotten beasts"). However, the phrase "acoustically perceptive ears" is a jarring, clunky artifact that disrupts the otherwise immersive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery like "unfolding like a story told backward." A few phrases lean toward the conventional ("metallic tang," "didn't have to"), but the overall density and lack of scaffold sentences support the story's atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but saturated with received phrasing ("pieces clicking into place," "salt-kissed," "curling into the stars"). These clichés flatten the emotional impact, and the "montage" summary at the end saps the scene of its immediate sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a density of "purple" metaphors and standard literary tropes ("hands remembered... before her mind did," "tuning forks"). The reliance on adjectives and abstract similes ("sympathy bold as the arbor’s edges") clutters the line-level momentum. The rhythm is smooth, but the imagery often prioritizes prettiness over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("wings folded like a secret"). There is a slight tendency toward dense modification that occasionally slows momentum, but the line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is highly polished and rhythmic with strong image density. However, the final paragraphs shift into expository telling ("He would call it...") which creates a slight drag on momentum compared to the dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwritten descriptions and cliché similes ("clear as a bell," "cut... like a blade"). The reliance on jewel-tone adjectives ("cobalt," "amethyst," "sapphire") feels slightly precious and repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive scaffolding, specifically the "Not X, but Y" construction which appears at least eight times ("not from the wind, but from...", "not in color... but in...", "not as invaders, but as..."). High simile density ("like beeswax," "like a fist," "like lightning," "like a seed," "like a promise") clutters the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and legible, with good information density, though it leans on some standard literary similes ("trapped sunbeam," "parched earth"). The visual imagery is clear, but the reliance on familiar descriptors prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but marred by "writerly" clichés ("ripple of water," "sheer weight of silence") and shortcuts like "suddenly she understood." The fragmented syntax in the final paragraph ("She didn't need to. The world was enough") feels formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative but occasionally overwritten, with a high density of metaphors ("bitten by time," "spines of forgotten books") that can feel decorative. Some phrasings, like "notes were wrong in all the right ways," lean into cliché, though the overall rhythm is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is dense with similes ("like a stone," "like a mirage," "like wounds," "like an arrow") that clutter the rhythm. Subject-verb sentence openers are repetitive, and phrases like "swallowing the last breath of bad habits" feel strained and melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjective clutter in key moments ("courageously kind thought" is a weak tell). Repetition of words like "symphony" and "song" within short spans reduces lexical freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished and dense, but relies on some cliché structures ("hummed like a struck bell," "Boredom was a...") and metaphor stacking. The rhythm is controlled, though the high frequency of abstract nouns ("concept," "geometry," "infinity") slightly dulls the physical immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is high-quality with strong density and evocative imagery ("dissolving like sugar in tea," "reeking of formaldehyde and bad decisions"). Sentence rhythm supports the rising tension, and the text avoids unnecessary scaffolding or clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is competent, with strong imagery, though it suffers from occasional repetition ("gilded") and slightly tangled metaphors. The prose style is elegant but leans toward "purple" description that distances the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. A few metaphors lean toward the conventional ("labyrinth's maw," "whispering in a language of rust"), preventing a top-tier score, but the technical execution is otherwise polished and free of scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose suffers from simile density, with "like [noun]" constructions appearing frequently (prayer, salt, birds, ash, embers), creating a repetitive scaffold. This reliance on simile over direct metaphor or action dilutes the immediacy of the high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically competent, but relies on stock descriptors ("acrid tang," "guilty secret," "wild heart") that reduce freshness. The line-level craft is functional but lacks the specific, idiosyncratic texture required for the highest literary echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is rhythmically sound but suffers from overwriting and density of figurative language ("ghosts of light," "knife-edge," "lover's farewell"). The metaphor "Earth hung like a pale jewel, swollen with unspoken promises" is mixed and slightly opaque. Line-level momentum is generally good despite the ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the prose is generally polished, a catastrophic repetition of the cliché "like a second skin" occurs in both the opening and closing paragraphs, breaking immersion. Additionally, phrases like "golden clarity" and "silent songs" lean toward purple prose, reducing the impact of the stronger, more tactile descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense with effective imagery ("reunited like rivers"), supporting the magical realism tone without confusion. A few clichés ("wasn't supposed to be here") and heavy reliance on pathetic fallacy ("sighing" ice, "groaning" beams) prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is rhythmically sound but marred by "poetic" clichés ("thrummed with life," "holding its breath," "shivered") that lower information density. While there are no mechanical errors, the reliance on familiar metaphors prevents the imagery from achieving the fresh, arresting quality required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished with strong rhythmic control ("hush *gathered*, pressing against her skin"), though the final section loses information density by switching to explanatory summary. "Dying heartbeat" is a minor cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally high-caliber and dense with imagery ("rusted needle in the throat"). However, a few worn phrases ("curled like question marks," "scream frozen mid-breath") mar the otherwise fresh descriptive work and prevent a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is lush but suffers from metaphor congestion, where nearly every noun carries a figurative modifier ("moonlight split like a knife," "voice... petals crumbling," "gesture like wind"). This density creates a static quality, forcing the reader to decode imagery rather than experiencing the scene’s momentum, and occasionally slips into repetitive "X was like Y" sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    While imagery is evocative, the reliance on "like a" similes (hymn, embers, stitches, promise, thread) creates a repetitive syntactic cadence. Several key moments rely on summary ("He didn't know why," "body moved by some older knowing") rather than immediate sensory proof.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and readable, with good rhythm. However, it relies on several stock phrases and clichés ("thick with cautious hope," "heavy with the weight," "unfurling like hands in prayer") that blunt the impact of the more original imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good information density. There is a tendency toward slightly ornamental figurative language ("neon ghosts," "chrome-and-glass skeleton") that borders on genre cliché, but the line-level craft remains competent.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery (e.g., "stood like a bruise"). There is a tendency toward density that occasionally borders on purple (e.g., "light bent into secrets"), but it generally serves the genre. Line-level momentum is strong, though the reliance on abstract metaphors in the climax obscures the physical action slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and simile fatigue. Nearly every noun is paired with a modifier or a "like/as" comparison ("roots like a secret," "paper soft as a pulse," "like water through lace," "like smoke," "like ghosts"). This density of figurative language clutters the high-pressure beats and reduces narrative momentum, obscuring the action behind ornamental scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from simile density ("like old barbed wire," "like a held note," "like the radio"), which creates a breathless, overwritten texture. The metaphor of "ribs singing" borders on the melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and possesses a pleasing rhythm, with moments of strong imagery ("dissolving like sugar in rain"). However, it occasionally leans on cliché similes ("like lovers in a dance") and standard fantasy phrasings ("hummed to life"), which prevents the line-level craft from feeling truly fresh or distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose relies on somatic clichés ("pulse stuttered," "breath hitched") that dull the physical immediacy of the magic. Some imagery turns abstract ("flower made of sound") right when concrete sensory detail is needed to ground the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from "writerly" affectations like "candidly cryptic" (clunky modifier) and "thrummed with whispers" (cliché). These flourishes distract from the otherwise solid imagery and create a layer of artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose suffers from unrelenting figurative density ("ribs bloomed," "syllable a scar," "photosynthesize pain"), creating a "purple" texture that exhausts the reader. The beauty is evident, but the lack of unadorned sentences to ground the metaphors hinders pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose suffers from significant "thesaurus churn" and adjective stacking (e.g., "delicate, brittle things," "touch too sharp, too real," "bitter, poisonous, beautiful"), which creates a melodramatic rhythm. Phrases like "shattered rainbows" and "held breath released" are clichés that detract from the otherwise solid craft.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally polished but stumbles in the conclusion with repetitive anaphora ("The point was... The point was...") that reads as scaffold or authorial intrusion. Occasional clichés ("bloomed like a bruise") and filter verbs ("Elara realized") detract from the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from several mixed metaphors and clichés that mar otherwise competent writing. Images like "seats sagging like the breath" break logical consistency, while phrases like "shadows pooling like ink," "eyes like cracked flint," and "sun was a blade" rely on tired stock descriptors. These artifacts lower the density and freshness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is atmospheric, it leans on several stock phrases ("second skin," "ghost of pipe smoke," "sharp enough to draw blood") that detract from the otherwise high specificity. These clichés flatten moments that demand fresher language.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought, with similes that draw attention to themselves ("cut the dark like poorly aimed scissors") rather than clarifying the image. While the rhythm is generally good, the density of figurative language in the search scenes slows momentum where it should accelerate. The required phrase "featherly determined" stands out as awkward adjectival modification.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the rhythm is generally smooth, the prose is marred by significant clichés ("ghost in the corroded wiring," "holding onto something too tightly") and forced phrasing ("laughed, softly ingenious"). These artifacts disrupt the vividness of the imagery and reduce the line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pivotal line—"The missing pieces were never gone. They were inside her all along"—is a significant cliché that undermines the story's literary aspirations. While the sentence-level rhythm is generally competent, the reliance on abstract-concrete pairings ("cheerful gloom," "breadcrumbs of possibility") creates a dense but slightly manufactured texture.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from fragmentation; the excessive line breaks disrupt flow and mimic "LinkedIn-style" writing rather than literary density. Phrasing occasionally lapses into cliché ("hungry mouth") or purple abstraction. The density is diluted by the scaffolding of the philosophical explanations.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is weighed down by cliché similes ("like a blade unsheathed," "waterlilies... like clenched fists") and abstract diction ("void," "silence," "grace") that blurs the imagery. Metaphors are often mixed or vague, prioritizing sound over clear visual or physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    A high density of simile artifacts (nine instances of "like a..." constructions) creates a repetitive rhythmic scaffold that dulls the prose. Several images rely on clichés ("forgotten promise," "old man's bones," "blade through silk") rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the imagery is often vivid, the prose suffers from a noticeable repetition loop ("slow dance of celestial bodies" appears verbatim in the intro and outro) and some cliché-adjacent phrasing ("silence that settled like ash"). These artifacts drag on the otherwise solid density.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Repetitive sentence openers (Subject-Verb: "Liora turned," "Liora stepped," "Liora picked up") create a plodding rhythm that drags on momentum. Abstract causality in key moments ("sheer force of the equation balancing") obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with good rhythm. However, the phrase "sensitively perceptive" is tautological and clunky, and the ending dissolves into scaffoldy moralizing that disrupts the otherwise immersive imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is competent but suffers from adjective density ("dying light," "fractured rainbows") that slows momentum. Required prompt phrases like "perceptively calm" and "dusky harmony" feel inserted rather than woven into the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose has a strong rhythm but suffers from high density of figurative language ("grain dark as the void," "quiet violence of hope," "polished grief") that teeters into overwriting. The reliance on abstract oxymorons reduces the concrete impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished but suffers from interpretive scaffolding ("The act was absurd, pointless") that tells the reader how to feel. Several moments rely on rhetorical framing ("A scientist would have...") rather than immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on clichés and mixed metaphors ("shattered glass" snow, "precision of a surgeon, grace of a dancer"). Phrases like "living poem of restraint" are ornamental artifacts that obscure meaning rather than sharpening it. The rhythm is competent, but the density of adjectives slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and high metaphor density ("ribs rusted into a permanent sigh," "words still hum in the bones," "unspooled lies like silk"). This pervasive figurative language obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene and slows narrative momentum, violating the standard for clarity and concision.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but credibility suffers from a biological error: identifying the insect as a "monarch" (butterfly) and then a "moth," undermining the protagonist's "realist" precision. Some phrasing leans toward the precious ("melody losing its notes"), reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, though prone to pathetic fallacy ("walls wept," "wind... answered") and dense abstraction. The phrase "snowmelt ardor given form" borders on purple, and the reliance on "as if" constructions weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with some strong imagery (the rusted hatch). However, it occasionally leans on familiar clichés ("thunder laughed," "swallowed her whole") that dilute the freshness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery ("split like a fruit"), but is marred by occasional stock phrasing ("drunk on power," "waited centuries to exhale"). The abstract phrasing of emotions ("empirically ironic thrill") acts as a scaffold rather than a dramatized state.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but "cellular memory" creates a jarring register break (scientific diction) in a mythic setting. Some metaphors ("snapped like a wish denied") veer toward melodrama, reducing the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy reliance on "breath" and "exhale" motifs (paragraphs 8, 9, 11, 14, 20) creates a distracting, repetitive physiological scaffold often seen in generated text. While the prose has rhythm, the density of similes and abstract nouns ("shimmer," "dream," "silence") muddies the line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    While grammatically clean, the prose relies heavily on similes and "as if" constructions (over 12 instances, e.g., "like a nail," "like leaves," "as if whispering"), diluting immediacy. Several comparisons approach cliché ("thin as skin," "warm as breath," "uneven as a heartbeat"), which detracts from the otherwise high literary ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("Veyra pressed," "Veyra splashed," "Veyra stepped") and relies on cliché physical tells ("fingers trembled," "breath hitched"). These stock phrases flatten the emotional impact of otherwise imaginative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose has high density and evocative phrasing ("unbloomed," "dissonance"), though similes like "smooth as old parchment" and "ink in water" are clichés that slightly dull the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from simile density ("like a memory," "like a thirsty ghost," "like a seamstress"), which clutters the pacing. Some metaphors mix awkwardly (a "solace" that "festers"), reducing line-level clarity in favor of aesthetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmically smooth and professionally crafted, though it leans toward overwriting in places ("edges humming as if the tower’s heartbeat had syncopated"). Some imagery borders on mixed metaphor ("voice like ink drying"), but the line-level momentum is generally good.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm and imagery are generally strong, but occasional sentimental metaphors ("breath curling... like a question mark," stone "as if nodding") border on twee. These artifacts distract slightly from an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on genre clichés ("bones of the earth," "forgotten math") that dull the imagery. Momentum is occasionally stalled by internal explanations of the magic system during active beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("rain’s afterecho," "thinned into silence"). The rhythm supports the contemplative tone, though some metaphor density in the middle section borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from abstract, synesthetic metaphors ("tang of old wishes," "hush was thick enough to chew") that obscure clarity for the sake of style. These artifacts reduce immediacy, creating a barrier of "fine writing" rather than delivering sharp, actionable imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is polished, there is a pervasive over-reliance on simile ("like spilled ink," "like unbroken spider silk," "like a pinprick," "like the air," "like a shell," "like a cloth," "like a stone"). This recursive sentence structure ("X was like Y") creates a rhythmic monotony and reduces the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density ("walls exhaled slow, damp breaths"). The phrase "intangibly tangible" is a slight stylistic stumble, but the overall control of imagery and metaphor is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and repetitive diction; "fractured" and "drift" appear frequently, and the phrase "vaulting hush" is repeated verbatim in paragraphs 4 and 31. Metaphorical density ("breath held too long becomes a kind of motion") occasionally obscures clarity, creating a "purple" texture that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but prone to adjectival clutter ("silver-leaved trees," "glowing pomegranates," "liquid light"). Some phrasings feel slightly overwritten, slowing momentum in favor of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but heavy with personification ("shadows breathed," "glow barely kissing") that borders on overwriting. The specific phrase "linking through the scars" feels mechanically inserted to satisfy constraints, creating a slight hiccup in the otherwise smooth metaphorical texture. Density is high, though occasionally abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery ("slipped through the seams of reality like rain"). A few metaphors ("cargo of compressed regret") lean heavily into abstraction, but this fits the story's central mechanic of concepts becoming physical.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies and stock metaphors ("lazy fingers," "yawn of twilight," "ghost of a melody," "discarded thought") that clutter the opening. These "of a" constructions and personifications reduce immediacy. The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with standout images like "dissolving into his palm like sugar in rain." However, the text occasionally leans on slightly worn metaphors ("wept... tears," "hurt like holy fire") or Lovecraftian shorthand ("color no human eye had named") which slightly dilutes the freshness of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and readable, with moments of nice rhythm ("life reduced to manila and staples"). However, it relies on familiar phrasing ("exhaled through his nose," "pulse quickened") and some filtering that distances the immediate experience. The letter from Daniel reads a bit too expository for a found artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, though occasionally verges on purple ("sky bled violet," "liquid memory"). Rhythm is well-managed, though the reliance on summary in the final third saps the momentum generated in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is significantly overwritten, suffering from a high density of metaphors that obscure the action ("curling... like smoke," "tears on the skin," "thick as velvet," "weep rainbows"). The figurative clutter impedes momentum and clarity during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally evocative prose is marred by a jarring tense error ("She prod the moonstone again" instead of "prodded") at a pivotal moment. The rhythm is otherwise good, though some imagery leans toward the conventional ("iridescent as a dragonfly’s wing").

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery, though some metaphors feel stacked or decorative ("black as a held breath"). The rhythm is generally good, but the reliance on abstract assertions in the narration creates a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong verbs and evocative imagery like "guttered out" and "threading through." At times, the density of figurative language (e.g., "luminous regret," "weeping rust") verges on overwriting, but it generally suits the high-fantasy mode.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from a high density of formulaic similes ("like a held breath," "like a tuning fork," "like burrs," "like conspirators," "like a promise," "like the hidden sun"). This repetitive "like [noun]" structure (6+ instances) creates a rhythmic drone and scaffolding artifact that detracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery ("pewter darkened to violet," "serrated silence"). The opening line ("anesthesia wore off") is a standard trope that misses a chance for a sharper hook, and some phrases border on purple ("unfurled in his mind like a wound opening"). Generally, the line-level craft supports the atmospheric intent without significant technical stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is marred by forced zeugmas ("stained with lapis and time") and familiar clichés ("time was a wheel"). The repetition of the prompt word "unfasten" across dialogue, action, and thought feels mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, though it leans heavily on a specific rhetorical structure ("Not X, but Y") which appears four times, creating a slightly repetitive cadence. Imagery is vivid ("dead stars," "geometry of dust"), though occasionally borders on the ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose relies on clichés ("groaning under the weight," "swirling sea of clouds") and abstract nouns ("liquid time," "eternity," "memory") in place of concrete imagery. These "purple" abstractions dilute the scene's physical reality. The line-level craft is functional but lacks the freshness and density required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmically assured, matching the baroque setting. A few moments lean slightly toward adjectival density ("burnished sorrow," "forgotten jewel"), but the effect remains potent.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor stacking and occasional clichés ("hollow eyes," "dying ember"). Phrases like "golden threads of dawns swallowed by midnight’s maw" are overly dense and verge on purple, obscuring the clarity of the image rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose has strong rhythm and momentum, but occasionally leans on cliché similes ("scattered stars," "jagged maw") that dull the imagery. Phrasing like "hinged awakenings" leans into abstraction without enough concrete grounding to make the metaphor land viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from density in figurative language and occasional clichés (“winking out like a dying star”). The use of pathetic fallacy (“archway groaned as if in answer”) detracts from the otherwise grounded sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from simile overload ("like a confession," "like a wound," "like a dream"), which dilutes the imagery's impact. The ending utilizes a repetitive fragment cadence ("Like the postcards. Like the glass...") that reads as a stylistic artifact rather than earned rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally relies on genre-standard similes ("groaning like an old man’s bones") and synesthetic abstractions ("scent of... old paper" in the wind) that blur clarity. No mechanical loops, but the density of metaphor sometimes strains the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("lanterns bobbed like fireflies"), with strong rhetorical structures emphasizing the shift in state ("Not rebuild. Not resurrect. But pull..."). Imagery is precise, avoiding clutter while maintaining a high density of sensory information.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, though simile density is high (seven distinct similes in a short space), which occasionally risks stalling momentum. However, the imagery is consistently on-brand for the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and typically evocative ("wings unfolding like torn paper," "entropy was a lock"), driving the scene with strong imagery. However, a few phrases lean toward cliché ("breath curling like smoke," "sound like a rusted hinge"), which slightly dampens the freshness of the otherwise high-quality texture. Information density is high, with no wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("breath curling into the cold air," "thread of warning stitching through the storm"). Pacing is well-managed. Minor friction arises from "zero hour," a term that feels modern/military against the "whale-sinew" and "abbot" aesthetic, though it is integrated syntactically.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.5)
    A repetitive rhetorical scaffold ("It wasn't X. It was Y.") appears five times, creating a sermon-like cadence that flattens the prose. The writing relies on personification clichés ("the universe exhaled") instead of concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasional metaphors feel slightly decorative or standard ("ribs of buried giants," "golden tears"). The line-level craft supports the tone, but repetitive sentence structures and filters stall the momentum in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but overwritten in the final third, relying on heavy-handed rhetorical devices ("The silo wasn’t a tomb. It was a loom") that veer into twee territory. The rhyming conclusion detracts from the gravity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("words emerging as if already half-drowned"), creating a strong textural experience. However, the reliance on filter verbs and explicit emotion ("The poet smiled," "felt alive") slightly dulls the immediacy of the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high with strong, consistent imagery ("joints to brittle hinges," "breath... like wind through dead leaves") that unifies the body and the orchard. The rhythm supports the pacing, and there are no significant scaffold artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overreliance on the &quot;Not X, but Y&quot; rhetorical structure (used four times for key concepts) creates a repetitive template cadence. The opening metaphor (&quot;slick with memory&quot;) strains clarity for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. However, the density of similes in the opening paragraphs ("like a broken rib," "like smoke," "sharp as flint") creates a textural thickness that slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by cliché metaphors ("broken promise," "rusted beast," "secret held too long") and adjectival stacking. Several sentences follow a repetitive rhythm ("The [noun] [verb]ed, its [noun] [modifying phrase]"), which creates a droning cadence that dulls the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing ("pulse like a dying star’s last sigh") and some clichés ("silence so deep it echoed"). These artifacts reduce the immediacy and freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally lush and dense with imagery ("sun bled violet"), though marred by occasional awkward phrasing ("moved sacredly playful") and some adjectival stacking that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.0)
    The logic error regarding the penumbra's weakness (pain vs. silence) disrupts the line-level coherence. Syntactically, the prose relies heavily on repetitive Subject-Verb sentence openers ("Liora traced," "Liora knelt," "Liora began," "Liora caught"), creating a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is dense but suffers from a repetitive rhetorical template ("It wasn't X; it was Y") used four times to deliver insights. Some metaphors are strained ("caught light like a held breath"), and the density of figurative language occasionally obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose flows with a strong rhythm, but suffers from moments of telling ("fidgeting not from nerves") and poetic overwriting ("woven hush," "fierce repose"). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("marrow thick with confessions," "swallowed the echoes whole") that advances the atmosphere. The rhythm supports the pacing of the climb and climax without slipping into repetitive sentence structures or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    Metaphor density is too high, obscuring action with ornament ("scream frozen mid-birth," "pupils of swirling mercury"). The use of abstract comparisons for sensory details ("scent of... something like regret") is a stylistic flaw that weakens the prose's vividness.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rhythmic but marred by stock imagery ("bioluminescent moss," "waves retreating") and adverb stacking ("intimately, achingly"). These "creative writing" artifacts dilute the text's freshness and density.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose relies heavily on a "like a [noun]" simile scaffold (7+ instances in a short text), which creates a repetitive textural pattern. This density of figurative language distracts from the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on several genre clichés ("rough as gravel," "ghosts of transmissions," "breathing" patina). While the imagery is dense, it occasionally prioritizes familiar poeticisms over fresh, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and dense, but occasional heavy-handed similes ("guttered like his hope") and mixed sensory logic ("musk strong enough to mask the glass’s unnatural weight") detract slightly. The rhythm and information density are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from scaffolded repetition ("the way the tide... the way seagulls... the way the stranger") that feels like a list rather than organic observation. The reliance on summary ("Elias had spent the last seventy-two hours...") creates a density dip where active scene work is needed. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally strains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery like "roots parting like fingers," but relies on a few stock phrases ("weight of things unsaid," "eyes crinkling") that soften the impact. These artifacts prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier despite the strong sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the rhythm is generally strong, the prose suffers from significant clichés in peak moments ("pain was exquisite," "thousand needles," "staining the sky like a wound"). Visible scaffolding phrases ("Halfway up," "Inside," "Below") create a somewhat blocky transition structure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like veins," "like restless ghosts," "like a question," "like a fruit"), which creates a repetitive cadence and dulls impact. Abstract phrasing ("pull her into the next equation") often replaces concrete blocking, reducing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from several "workshop" metaphors that dull the impact. Similes like "unraveled like a sigh" and phrases like "clawed at his ribs" are familiar stock imagery. The personification of the wind ("like a thing that knew him") feels less fresh than the specific imagery of the runes.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is weighed down by a high density of similes and stock imagery ("smooth as river stones," "fingers curling... like roots," "steady as a heartbeat"). These clichés and the reliance on filter verbs ("he thought," "imagining") create a barrier to immediacy. The writing is polished but ornamental, prioritizing poetic sound over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.1)
    A specific syntactic loop ("not X, but Y") appears eleven times in this short text, creating a monotonous, lecturing drumbeat (e.g., "not from altitude, but from," "not to draw, but to remember"). Metaphors are high-density and occasionally strain clarity ("rocks seemed to lean in").

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and structurally sound, with high information density. There is a tendency toward simile stacking ("like plucked strings," "like a deflating bellows," "like ink," "like vines") which draws attention to the writing itself, but the imagery remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose flows rhythmically but suffers from a high density of literary clichés ("dust motes hung like suspended stars," "living, breathing," "wounded birds," "first time in forever"). These stock images dilute the vividness of the scene, preventing the line-level craft from matching the ambition of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    While mechanically clean, the prose relies on several stock phrases ("clung... like a barnacle," "pulse roared in his ears," "breath hitched") that blunt the impact of high-tension moments. The simile "needle through silk" is functional but familiar. Greater freshness in the sensory metaphors would elevate the line-level quality to match the structural strength.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory details and rhythmic control. A few moments veer into overwriting ("physics of letting go"), but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric intent of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Occasionally, metaphors become slightly overwrought ("pressed it between their palms in apology"), and the compound adjective "clover-melancholy" feels ornamental. Generally, the line-level craft supports the story's ethereal tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but occasionally repetitive (using "bleeding" and "bleed" in close proximity) or reliant on standard similes ("like a metronome"). The imagery is generally strong, but the phrasing lacks the density required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from repetitive reliance on the word "steep" (used as a primary verb/metaphor in three separate paragraphs), creating a noticeable loop. Some phrasing leans on clichés ("sharp as a needle's prick," "sound like a sigh") that dull the otherwise high-quality imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("swallowing its own echoes"), though occasionally leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction ("cold as a promise"). The rhythm is strong, and line-level craft supports the atmospheric tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from cliché and therapy-speak in key moments ("storm of screaming wind," "hands empty, his heart full"). While the sensory descriptions are strong, the reliance on abstract emotional summaries ("spaces between sound and meaning") dilutes the scene's immediacy. The rhythm is smooth but lacks variation in intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but the climax suffers from a physical logic break with "dipped the pen into the well of his own breath," which reads as a mixed metaphor or confusing magic. Additionally, the phrase "something like ink, something like memory" drifts into vague abstraction at a moment that demands precision.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on stock metaphors ("laughter... rung like bells," "blade wrapped in velvet") and abstract similes ("unraveling like ink in water") that obscure clarity. The density of figurative language in peak beats dilutes the imagery rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from clunky, tell-heavy phrasing ("Elias had been analytically intuitive then") and clichés ("The sun rose, indifferent"). Adjective-noun pairings often feel forced or purple ("volcanic tenderness," "unspoken vows"), and the reliance on abstract nouns weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a jarring tense shift in the climatic paragraph ("The lagoon’s surface froths... unspools") while the rest of the story is in past tense, breaking immersion at the pivotal moment. Additionally, the text relies on clichéd imagery ("shattered glass," "concentric rings") and scaffolded sentence openings ("Then another. And another.") that weaken the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose relies heavily on the "Not [X], but [Y]" rhetorical construction (used four times), creating a repetitive cadence that feels formulaic. Parenthetical "tells" in the second paragraph disrupt the show-don't-tell flow of the observation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose leans toward purple ("drowned sunlight," "forgotten promises"), prioritizing lyricism over clarity. The phrase "spiralingly calm" is grammatically awkward and reads as a forced insertion, disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from cliché and twee imagery ("breath curling like question marks"). Some metaphors are mixed or inaccurate ("cobalt... like a bruise"), and the reliance on "and then" structures to bridge the time jumps flattens the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    A distinct proofreading error ("a impatient lover") mars the text. More critically, there is a high density of formulaic similes (verb + like/as + abstract noun) that creates a repetitive template cadence (e.g., "like old grudges," "as regret," "like a bad dream").

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and evocative, though it occasionally leans into heavy metaphor ("cutting the sky into rhythmic slices," "petals scattering like confetti"). The rhythm is strong, but the density of figurative language in the opening and closing beats draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on several clichés ("breath held too long," "winter's last gasp," "ink in water") that dilute the freshness of the imagery. The flow is good, but the reliance on stock metaphors prevents higher textural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent but leans heavily on sentimental imagery ("sigh caught in a jar," "trapped fireflies") and platitudes ("Some awakenings were worth any cost") that reduce information density. Rhythm is generally good, though the reliance on sentence fragments for emphasis ("Not destruction. Beginning.") becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with imagery; the descriptions of sound and light are technically skilled. A few phrases lean into cliché ("shattered constellation," "bloom of a question"), but the overall line-level craft supports the story's atmospheric intent.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically sound, with strong images like "roots breaking stone." However, it relies on stock phrasing for emotional beats ("hollow eyes," "trembling smile," "coiled tight"), which flattens the otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative ("fractured the dawn into liquid prisms"), though occasionally dense with modifiers. The imagery is strong, but a few metaphors feel slightly overworked, bordering on the ornamental; however, the rhythm generally supports the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.5)
    The distinct phrase "steadily unpredictable" is reused (once for sound, once for heart), creating a distracting artifact. Abstract metaphors like "atoms of nostalgia" feel forced, likely to satisfy prompt requirements, and reduce line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose flows well but is marred by several exhausted similes ("hands like yellowed parchment," "curled... like a sleeping cat") that lower the freshness of the imagery. While there are no mechanical loops, the reliance on these clichés prevents the line-level craft from reaching a professional standard of specificity. The rhythm is competent but lacks variation in intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high technical competence. However, the density of figurative language ("jagged absence like a half-told lie," "dissolving like sugar," "translucent as dawn on spider silk") borders on overwriting, drawing attention to the author's hand rather than the image.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from high figurative density that occasionally drags momentum ("brown halos of hesitation and haste," "voice thin with thirst"). The reliance on similes in quick succession ("like a splinter," "like a tuning fork," "like dry leaves") feels slightly repetitive and overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by forced integration of prompt words; "incubate in her grip" is semantically awkward and breaks immersion. The high density of metaphorical language sometimes clutters the image rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and mixed metaphors ("dates blooming like flowers in fast-forward") that obscure clarity for the sake of ornament. While grammatically functional, the density of adjectives and abstract nouns ("echo of a thousand unlocked stories") slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with good rhythmic variety and sensory density. A few phrases border on purple ("Möbius strip of rust and possibility"), but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric intent without significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but dense with mixed or strained metaphors ("tuning fork pressed to the ribs of the world") that obscure clarity. Some descriptions feel performative ("taste of a question") and the reliance on "He [verb]" sentence structures creates a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally strong with high image density ("star-shaped stamp still sharp enough to bite"). However, a reliance on abstract metaphors in peak beats ("courage... in the pause") softens the impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is generally high-quality, the verbatim repetition of the unique phrase "seraphically mundane" constitutes a significant text loop that breaks immersion. Additionally, the "held breath" metaphor is reused, indicating a lack of lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with fresh imagery ("frayed like the hem of a god’s discarded robe") that serves the story’s tone. Sentence variety and rhythm support the pacing, particularly in the staccato delivery of the warnings versus the flowing description of the library. No significant artifacts or loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the rhythm is generally controlled, the prose is marred by distinct clichés ("generators coughed to life," "ink running like tears"). The presence of a stock simile in the closure beat significantly weakens the literary impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from simile overload, with nearly every paragraph relying on a "like" or "as" construction ("like a yawn," "like a dead transmission," "like a bird," "like an old man"). This pattern becomes a distracting scaffold that dilutes the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose flows well but relies on stock phrasing ("fingers trembled," "sigh") and anachronistic similes ("fast-motion") that clash with the setting. The personification of the plants ("chorus of a thousand roots cheering") leans toward the twee.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level propulsion. The explicit definition of the "somatic method" ("a trick learned from a trauma therapist") is a minor expository bump, but necessary for the prompt; otherwise, the imagery ("veins mirrored the cracks") is precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from "simile churn," with abstract comparisons ("hinges split like a promise") appearing in nearly every paragraph, obscuring the physical reality. This overwriting creates a purple texture that dulls the immediacy of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent and moves the story forward, but relies on several familiar phrasings ("breath curling like smoke," "stretched thin like a bowstring," "eyes burned"). The imagery of the ink is strong, but the reliance on standard similes prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several prompt phrases are pasted verbatim into the text ("within the blink that follows surprise," "pulse scandalized the stillness"), disrupting the natural rhythm. The prose leans toward mixed metaphors ("ink that smelled of... old lies") and abstract noun-heavy descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm is controlled, but lexical choices like "inculcating the roots" distract, clashing with the physical immediacy of gardening. A few standard metaphors ("scream of dust," "sandcastle under a boot") dilute the otherwise high-resolution imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong but marred by a notable cliché ("hit like a wave") at a pivotal emotional beat. Additionally, a repetitive "He [verb]" sentence pattern in the middle section (digging/confrontation) creates a mechanical rhythm that disrupts the otherwise high-quality flow.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is competent but marred by "writerly" overwriting and clichés (e.g., "hummed with the weight of silence," "tomorrow's ink"). These flourishes draw attention to the author's hand rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from significant simile density (seven instances of "like [noun]" in a short space), including clichés ("hummed like a dying star," "like old wounds"). This overwriting distracts from the vivid core imagery and creates a predictable cadence that dilutes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from abstract synesthesia ("tasted like lavender and possibility") and stock phrasing ("slotted into his mind like a key"). These artifacts detract from the otherwise sharp imagery of the chalk and sand.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense but occasionally overwrought ("arms of steel and shattered light"). The reliance on abstract metaphors and the specific register clash in the attribute description detract from an otherwise competent line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on a density of similes ("folded like a careless handkerchief," "petals... like brittle applause") that violates the overwriting guardrails. While rhythmically competent, the constant figurative language creates a barrier to immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose has strong rhythm but occasionally drifts into overwriting ("willowglass hope," "ghost of a thought"). The phrase "devised the sequence without thinking" is a semantic contradiction that weakens the agency of the line. The reliance on em-dashes for dramatic pauses is slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong opening imagery. However, metaphorical abstraction sometimes dilutes clarity ("topographic map of grief," "symphony of anxiety"), and "filter" verbs ("Lior understood," "Lior knew") distance the reader from the raw moment of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, though it occasionally leans on stock phrasing ("pressed to his chest like a second heart," "lips parted as if to scream"). The density of imagery is high, but the reliance on familiar similes slightly dulls the impact of the unique setting.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm, but suffers from metaphor density and occasional logic lapses in imagery. "Silvered stains" lacks physical clarity (ash is grey/black; silver suggests age or metal), and "cracked her resolve like a thawed river cracking ice" is somewhat tautological and wordy. The personification of prudence and daring is a noticeable stylistic artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally evocative, though "closely attentive gaze" is a clunky, adjective-heavy tell that disrupts the otherwise strong imagery. The phrase "spindrift serenity" leans toward purple prose but fits the requested lyric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density and cliché ("ghost of honey," "thrummed... like a string"), creating a texture that feels overwritten. The reliance on abstract similes ("unspooled the fractured timelines like thread") distances the reader from the physical immediacy of the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm and sentence variety are strong, but the prose suffers from "purple" tendencies (e.g., "luminous harbor air," "fractured stars"). The phrase "wistfully pragmatic offering" is an adverb-heavy tell that weakens the specific action of using blood as fertilizer.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and imagery ("claws clicked against brass, a Morse code of extinction"). Line-level craft is high, though it occasionally prioritizes poetic abstraction over concrete action, particularly during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from a density of similes ("like a held breath," "like yarn," "stitching the air") that draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. While technically clean, the reliance on poetic construction occasionally obscures the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is functional and moves the story forward, with some strong images ("voices suddenly too thin to carry weight"). However, it suffers from occasional weak modifiers ("suddenly," "cautiously") and slightly mixed metaphorical imagery ("nest of angry stars") that softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong sensory details ("blue-black as a bruise"). A few phrases lean on clichés ("breath turned traitor") or slight overwriting ("slow weep of centuries"), but the rhythm during the action beats is controlled and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is evocative and polished with high information density. However, a high frequency of "like/as" similes (e.g., "like a question," "like a pulse," "like sighs") creates a slight pattern artifact that occasionally prioritizes decoration over momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is energetic and propulsive, but marred by stock phrasing at pivotal moments ("clear as day," "coiled like a fist") that dulls the line-level impact. While density is good, these clichés prevent the craft from reaching the high bands of freshness required for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is dense with overwriting ("shard of frozen twilight") and relies on tired tropes ("ozone and burnt sugar" appears twice). Phrasing like "scaffold wrap flutters" reads as intelligible filler, and the metaphor density obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    While technically competent, the prose suffers from a high density of similes (seven "like/as" constructions in a short space), creating a repetitive, ornamental cadence that slows momentum. This figurative clutter distracts from the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with similes ("pulsed like a dying heartbeat," "unspooling like a sigh," "glowing like embers," "lifting like smoke"). This figurative clutter stifles momentum and results in a "purple" texture that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from a heavy reliance on italicized emphasis (*swirl*, *laughed*, *remembering*, *choosing*, *digest*, *kept*, etc.), which dictates reading rhythm artificially rather than through syntax. While the imagery is often strong, occasional stock phrases ("voice like cracking ice," "warm as a heartbeat") dilute the freshness of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant density of stock metaphors and abstractions ("time’s greedy mouth," "bruised into dusk," "pain transmuting into something like flight") that obscure physical action. Phrasing like "purposefully curious hands" reads as an awkward modifier insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the rhythm is generally strong, the prose relies on several clichés ("holes in her soul," "broken, still beautiful," "heart no longer a cage") that dull the impact. The phrase "dusky resolve of the corridor's glow" is a category error that strains the metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally solid with good density, but suffers from "writerly" similes ("resisting like a stubborn memory") and the diagnostic "insulating emotionally" phrase which tells rather than shows. Rhythm is controlled, but the explicit philosophizing slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("humming like a struck tuning fork"). A few metaphors feel slightly overwritten (sap "embarrassed by its own luminosity"), and the "drop becomes a river" list borders on template cadence, but overall craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative but suffers from "purple" tendencies, stacking metaphors ("fractaling dawn," "liquid opals") that occasionally clutter the imagery. The phrase "breath fogging the air like a question mark" leans toward cliché. Despite this, the rhythm is strong, and the line-level propulsion maintains the dreamlike momentum required by the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a rhythmic reliance on staccato fragments for profundity ("A confession. Not hers." "Not a weapon. A crown."). There are also instances of expository interiority ("She understood then...") that explain the symbolism rather than allowing it to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally evocative but occasionally stumbles into strained metaphors ("weight that didn’t float," "color of old bruises") that feel writerly rather than organic. There is also a mild repetitive cadence in sentence openings ("He crouched," "He pressed," "He stood") that hampers the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    While polished, the prose density is high with figurative language ("mist swallowed," "breath curling," "spine whispering") that borders on overwriting. Phrasing like "smelled of burnt sugar and lies" relies on familiar synesthetic tropes that soften the specific imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density and no scaffold loops. Phrasing is inventive ("perforated by choices not yet made"), though occasional synesthetic abstractions ("tasted like mulberry ache") push the boundaries of clarity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, relying on "something X but Y" constructions ("not light but something older") and abstract metaphors ("bones of forgotten winds") that obscure meaning. These stylistic flourishes reduce clarity and immediacy, creating a barrier of "fine writing" between the reader and the action.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and evocative, but occasionally leans on slightly overwrought or familiar metaphors ("stars remember themselves," "bled into violet," "breath catching like a child’s"). While beautiful, these moments lack the startling freshness of the "scallop" imagery, holding the score back from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    There are moments of strong craft ("mud and resolve"), but the prose suffers from adverb stacking ("gloriously, terribly") and occasional cliché ("wind howled," "chimes screamed"). The dense metaphor mixing (sponge/cloak/stitching) in the middle muddies the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm (&quot;One ripple. Two.&quot;) and density, though occasionally dips into slightly overwrought personification (&quot;embarrassed by its own brilliance&quot;). The line-level craft generally supports the dreamlike quality of the narrative effectively without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is functional but marred by repetitive phrasing (e.g., "He didn't need to see..." appears twice in close proximity) and sentence structures ("The skimmer [verb]"). Reliance on clichés like "bruised twilight" and telling ("Something was hunting") reduces the immediacy of the line-level experience.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and moves with good momentum, but suffers from occasional "writerly" intrusions (e.g., wind "howling like a choir of disapproving mentors"). Some metaphors feel slightly ornamental rather than organic to the POV's immediate sensory experience. No major technical flaws, but lacks the density of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished with high information density and strong imagery. The rhythm varies effectively to match the protagonist’s movements. Minor deductions for occasional abstract-concrete pairings ("smelled of... old promises") that feel slightly derivative of the genre, but overall execution is high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high density. There is a tendency toward repetitive abstraction ("negative space" appears twice in similar contexts) and some slightly affected phrasing ("un-become," "metal bones") that draws attention to the writing over the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.1)
    While imagery is strong ("slipped through their ribs like eels"), the prose suffers from scaffolded paragraphing that artificially inflates the weight of simple actions. Motivation is often told ("He wanted to give them shapes") rather than shown, and some phrasing leans into cliché ("The reaper didn’t answer. He never did.").

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from metaphor density and cliché ("waking beast," "flashing like a blade," "fingers bled"). Adjectives and adverbs do heavy lifting ("earnestly naive," "brittle devotion"). The rhythm relies on dramatic fragments ("Then another. And another.") that feel like a stylistic crutch.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from mixed metaphors ("hue of a held breath") and heavy-handed similes ("like the first snow of a forgiveness"). While the rhythm is controlled, the density of figurative language stifles the immediate reality of the scene and drifts into "purple" territory.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    While polished, the prose suffers from adjectival clutter ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "fractured rainbows," "deliberate care") that slows momentum. The reliance on abstract metaphors ("equations only the sky could solve") sometimes obscures physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but relies on familiar similes ("unfurling like a held breath released," "swayed like a ship") that dampen originality. Rhythm is solid, but the density of "writing about silence" tropes slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clear but marred by repetitive phrasing (the specific phrase "sliced through [the] pretense" appears in both narration and dialogue) and clichés ("fell like blessings"). These artifacts and the reliance on abstract descriptors in the final paragraph weaken the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with evocative imagery ("old bone," "dried scorpion’s heart"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the pacing of events. There are no significant line-level artifacts or clichés, though the high volume of pathetic fallacy (nature having emotions) is a specific stylistic choice that dominates the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasionally it tips into purple territory ("macerated the silence," "symphony conducted"). The imagery is generally dense and effective, successfully balancing the mechanical and the emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and image-rich ("dimensionally homesick" is a standout phrase), but the density of "verb... like [noun]" similes (roughly ten in a short space) creates a repetitive template cadence. This structural artifact distracts slightly from the otherwise high quality of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is propulsive and dense with imagery ("shattered into teeth"), though some similes ("like a dying heart," "like a damaged clock") lean on familiar tropes. The writing is polished, but the "silent explosion" and hyperbolic ending description ("split the sky") feel slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    While competent, the prose suffers from a repetitive "She [verb]" sentence structure in the latter half (climbed, pressed, tuned, reached, descended) that creates a monotonous cadence. Additionally, metaphors like "drunken sentinels" and "dying symphony" lean toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally suffers from clashing imagery (smooth "blade through silk" vs. straining "groaning hull") and slightly twee phrasing ("chimed never") that draws attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally high-quality but stumbles on a significant cliché in the opening sentence ("clung to Elias like a second skin"), which hurts the piece's immediate authority. Occasional purple phrasing ("blackness that hummed") distracts, though the density of imagery is otherwise strong and propulsion is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. The prompt-mandated phrases ("balancedly curious," "somber marvel") feel slightly inserted and expository, disrupting the otherwise seamless texture of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by cliché clusters in high-stakes moments ("mist screamed," "knees hit the stone," "breath came shallow"). "Fracturing twilight" works, but the melodrama in physical reactions weakens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose flows well but relies on stock physiological markers ("breath shallow," "pulse hammering") and clichés ("jagged shadows") that dull the impact of the weird fiction elements. The sentence structure occasionally falls into scaffolded rhythms ("He hadn’t come to steal. He’d come to...") that feel formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    While atmospheric, the prose suffers from a glaring typo (“a entity”) and clichéd similes (“like a shadow,” “dying heartbeat”) in the opening beats. These slips materially undermine the literary polish required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from several stock similes ("warm as a heartbeat," "thick as chains," "blade dragged across old wounds") that dull the otherwise specific imagery. The repetitive "And... But... And..." sentence structures in the coda create a dragging rhythm that saps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and atmospheric, successfully sustaining the "frostbitten hope" tone. While simile density is high ("like schools of fish," "like polished river stones"), the imagery generally lands with precision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally competent but leans on abstractions and filter verbs ("She knew this moment," "listening") that distance the reader. While some imagery is striking, the reliance on "resonantly soft" as a modifier feels slightly forced and repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm, though some figurative language lands awkwardly (e.g., "bleating like distant sirens" mixes biological and mechanical imagery confusingly). The "storm in a bottle" description is a highlight of sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from several purple similes ("jagged like a broken promise," "language that sounded like wind through reeds") that reduce precision. Rhythm is good, but the reliance on abstract comparisons occasionally creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is overwritten with dense, sometimes mixed metaphors ("listen with the shape of your bones," "fossil of fleeting clarity"). Reliance on stock imagery ("liquid amber," "equations like incantations") obscures clarity and reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density that slows momentum. Phrases like "net for dreams," "cipher of longing," and "stitch the dream" stack atop one another. The rhythm is pleasing, but the high volume of figurative language in a short space feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high image density, though it leans heavily on similes ("like a held breath," "like a wound," "like a ship," "as a needle's eye") which can feel crowded in a short space. Line-level momentum is generally good, but the reliance on figurative language slightly obscures the physical action in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "hull split like a wishbone" and "iridescent residue." The language is controlled and propels the story forward without drag. A few metaphors lean towards the ornate ("drowned leviathan"), but they fit the established genre voice without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with strong phrasemaking like "Lies are where the interesting truths hide" and "shadow... pulsed like a held breath." A few phrases border on decorative ("light bends when it’s tired"), but the overall density and precision are high, serving the story's tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival clutter and standard pairings ("quiet defiance," "shimmering veil," "mortal eyes") that dampen freshness. The reliance on abstract nouns in the resolution ("the wonder. The weight of it") and the explanatory closing block reduce the line-level density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished, though the density of "poetic" modification (e.g., "silk spun from spider’s patience," "tangle of twine and regret") borders on overwriting. The rhythm is excellent, but the relentless adjectival pairing slightly dampens the raw impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished and readable but relies on several stock phrases and clichés ("seeped into your bones," "rippled like water," "embers in a dying fire"). The "not X, but Y" sentence structure is overused to define concepts, creating a repetitive cadence that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally high quality with strong density and rhythm ("books had bloated into pulpy sculptures"). A few similes lean slightly toward the melodramatic ("ink had bled... like old tears," "flickered like fallen stars"), which prevents a higher score, but the final image of the sediment is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose density is high with strong imagery ("voice like a child’s fingers brushing piano keys"). However, there is a slight reliance on standard rhetorical constructions ("Not in words, but in...", "Not in sound, but in...") that creates a repetitive cadence at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from mixed, abstract metaphors (light scattered "like broken promises") and repetitive sentence scaffolds ("The elevator groaned," "The elevator shuddered," "The elevator slowed") that dull the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("billowed like held breath," "pooled like rain," "bruised underbelly"), creating a crowded texture that slows momentum. While individual images are pretty, the reliance on "X was like Y" simile structures creates a repetitive cadence that distances the reader from the immediacy of the fall.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("blind cartographer," "language of pressure") without becoming purple. The rhythm supports the pacing, slowing down for the tactile puzzle and speeding up for the collapse. No significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.7)
    The opening "diligently curious" is weak telling, and "words hummed in her ribs" is a somatic cliché. While the rhythm is functional, the prose often substitutes flowery decoration ("stranded luminance") for concrete precision.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.3)
    While readable and rhythmically competent, the prose suffers from repetitive metaphorical habits, specifically regarding "breath" ("breath curled," "held breath" x3, "world's breath"). Additionally, some similes blur sense for style ("breath curled like old ink," "gummed with... memories"). These artifacts distract from the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but marred by familiar clichés ("silent sentinels") and slightly purple phrasing ("unspool their sorrows"). While readable, the line-level craft prioritizes poetic texture over narrative momentum or freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but occasionally overwrought, bordering on purple ("gears kissed its forehead like a blessing," "stars remembered how to blink"). While the density of imagery is high, the reliance on sentimental personification in the climax softens the impact of the darker elements introduced earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong with high density ("stone throat," "blind spots"). A few stock phrases ("silver fingers," "glistened like oil") and the slightly ambiguous mechanics of the nut/impression in the final beat prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from "simile density," with nearly every major image mediated by a "like" or "as" comparison (composer, sheet music, lattice, stone, letter). This overwriting tends to clutter the visual immediacy of the scene. The sentence structure occasionally falls into repetitive subject-verb openers ("He pulled," "He waded").

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is smooth but dense with stock similes ("rough as crumpled parchment," "like a held breath," "like a plucked string") that verge on cliché. While mechanically clean, the "scaffold" phrases ("Then—there") and high figurative density in the short span dampen the immediacy of the "incising" moment.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. A few phrases lean slightly purple ("whorl a sin"), but the overall craft is high-quality and supports the atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of simile scaffolding ("like an afterglow," "like a secret," "sharp as a blade," "like a held breath," "like a scythe"), which creates a repetitive textural rhythm. The insertion of the prompt phrase "empathetically decisive" as a dialogue tag appears artificial and disrupts the flow. Sentence variety is otherwise solid, but the reliance on figurative language softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from metaphor density and explicit "telling" artifacts ("perfect metaphor"). The phrase "quaking reverie of the moon" is a strained pathetic fallacy that feels forced to satisfy a prompt requirement. High adjective density slows momentum in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés ("curled... like a living thing," "winking out like extinguished stars," "clear as glass") that would disqualify it from top-tier literary markets. These artifacts dilute the otherwise vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.7)
    Metaphor density is high to the point of distraction, with six similes ("like breath," "like a child," "like tears," etc.) crowding the short text. This reliance on figurative scaffolding distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is technically functional but dense with purple abstractions ("unraveling of promises") and clichés ("pregnant" silence, "twilight bled"). Adjective clusters like "thoughtfully precise deliberation" slow momentum without adding concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and flowing. However, a few clichés ("sky still holding its breath") and slightly strained metaphors ("hand that slanted like a sigh") mar the otherwise high-quality line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and polished, with strong imagery ("disapproval softening like wax"). A few phrases ("tide's thought") lean towards abstract overwriting, but the line-level craft is generally high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("saw it," "felt") and clichés ("breath hitched," "crumbled to dust") that dull the narrative's immediacy. The reliance on adjective-heavy description slows the momentum in places where active verbs would be more effective.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Momentum is strong, but the prose relies on stock similes ("lifted like dolls," "ghosts in the margins") that dull the impact. The "hazy precision... tracing edges of a half-remembered dream" phrase is purple and slows the pacing of a critical investigative beat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose has strong rhythm and imagery ("bleeding into the air like ink in water"), but suffers from some overwriting and abstract telling. Phrases like "older than memory" and "certify wonder" dilute the concrete immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    While competent, the prose relies on cliché phrasing ("dying light," "shift of shadows," "held its breath") and filter verbs that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The required attribute "avalanchingly quiet" is integrated but syntactically awkward.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery like "stars vanished like breath on glass." The integration of required phrases is smooth, though "lucid turbulence" is slightly abstract. The line-level craft supports the story's momentum, with rhythmic variations that mirror the rising tension of the press. No significant artifacts or loops disrupt the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from cliché somatic markers ("breath hitched," "heart hammering") and a repetitive sentence cadence in the final third (multiple sentences starting with "The [noun] [verb]"). The overuse of "trembled" (fingers, ridgeway) and "exhaled" (abyss, twice) dilutes the impact of specific imagery. The rhythm becomes monotonous during the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and sensory-rich ("windows etched with intricate frost patterns," "scent of a struck match"). At times, the description leans toward the overwrought ("writhed like trapped things," "sorrowless streams"), but the rhythm generally propels the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose leans toward purple ("hush of time's unraveling") and includes awkward constructions like "stoically sparkling," which attributes incongruous emotion to an inanimate object. While there are moments of strong imagery ("embers under ash"), the density of abstract descriptors creates a "scaffold" effect that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the rhythm is generally competent, the prose relies on repetitive abstract descriptors ("quiet defiance," "azure defiance") and clichés ("cracks... where the light got in"). The density of similes in the opening interferes with momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose leans heavily on abstract rhetorical pairings ("not in grams, but in meaning"; "not with mass, but with promise") which tell significance rather than showing it. These repetitive constructions stall momentum and drift into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is marred by a severe repetitive artifact: the simile stem &quot;held [breath/note]&quot; appears five times (paras 4, 21, 29, 31, 38). This looping creates a template cadence that distracts significantly from otherwise evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose has strong rhythm and momentum but is marred by stock phrases ("teeth of time," "split like a ripe fruit") and vague descriptors ("light that wasn’t quite light"). These clichés undercut the otherwise sharp imagery of the lighthouse.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but the text suffers from self-conscious metaphors like the "question mark" steam. There is also a reliance on summary ("painted until his arms burned") that robs the pivotal moment of sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is marred by significant clichés ("moonlight pooled like liquid silver") and derivative imagery that weakens the literary quality. While rhythmically smooth, the density of stock figurative language obscures rather than illuminates the pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from simile overload (~10 "like/as" constructions in a short space) and synonym churn for vibration ("shivered," "trembled," "quivered," "shuddered"). This density of figurative language creates a scaffolded, repetitive rhythm that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is functional but relies on stock metaphors and clichés such as "phantom limbs," "nest of contradictions," and "breadcrumbs." These familiar phrases dull the impact of an otherwise competent style.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence-level craft is polished, with strong rhythm and sound ("unspooling like a memory"). A few images lean on cliché ("riot of wheat," "skeletal trees"), but the prose generally supports the magical realist tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose relies heavily on worn literary tropes and clichés, such as "older than time," "soft as snowfall," and "unraveling into stardust," which dilute the story's freshness. Adverb-heavy constructions like "gently meticulous" and "faintly" reduce the density and impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has strong rhythm and density, but is marred by significant clichés like "smile didn't reach his eyes" and "Time's up," which break the literary immersion. The metaphor of the "promise snapping like a dry bone" borders on overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with high information density and strong imagery ("petals trembling like static"). The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" is a weak abstraction in an otherwise concrete sensory landscape. The narrative rhythm flows well, though the rhetorical question in the climax drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong visual imagery, but the climax relies on cliché sensory lists (&quot;green that tasted like...&quot;) and template cadence (&quot;The first stroke was a scream. The second, a sob&quot;). These stylistic artifacts blunt the impact of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory imagery ("edges sharp enough to draw blood," "skin paled like parchment"). Sentences flow with good momentum. Minor tendency toward dense adjective pairings ("dying petals," "hushed tones") does not detract from overall clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose rhythm is smooth and the imagery is often striking, particularly the descriptions of sound and light. However, the text occasionally leans into overwrought phrasing ("bloom—like the unfurling," "unanswered in a headline") and abstract labels ("compromise," "truth") that slightly dull the immediacy of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery like the "loose screw" of magnetic north. A few metaphors feel slightly standard ("hummed like a dying bee"), but the line-level propulsion is steady, and the description of the fire "licking" and "dissolving" the objects is vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from severe simile overload ("like a slow exhale," "like a half-remembered secret," "like a sigh," "like a misplaced note," "like a heartbeat," "like a metronome," "like a thread"), creating a distracting artifact loop. This reliance on figurative language dilutes the imagery and slows momentum, while the ending dissolves into abstract summary ("the way it does when something broken begins to mend").

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. The imagery ("water pressed against the glass like a held breath") is evocative. Minor logical hiccup with "fogging the glass of a shattered vial" (hard to fog shards unless very close), but otherwise precise.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Information density and rhythm are generally strong, but specific clichés ("slipping like sand through his fingers," "thick as mud") mar the line-level freshness. While the "saltwater hissed" image is strong, the reliance on familiar similes in emotional beats prevents entry into the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.8)
    The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" appears twice; it is an awkward, oxymoronic construction that breaks the literary tone and reads as a forced artifact. The prose relies too heavily on abstract nouns and filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") which dilute the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with high information density and no scaffold. However, the density of thematic metaphors (wisteria as question marks, steam as letters, sky as contract, meteor as syllables) clusters in a way that draws attention to the authorial hand, slightly reducing immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm is generally smooth, but the prose suffers from "adjective-itis" and forced pairings ("silver-throated," "hollow ache," "tragically radiant"). The reliance on frequent similes ("like fireflies," "like a dying man," "like a white flag") creates density without always adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" artifacts and stock phrasing ("laughed, low and rusted," "slow as regret"). Abstract similes in low-pressure moments reduce immediacy. While the rhythm is controlled, the reliance on adjectival stacking and melodramatic descriptors prevents the line-level work from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally vivid and lyrical, but it suffers from "prompt-checking" artifacts where required phrases are inserted verbatim in ways that disrupt the fictive dream. Additionally, some phrasing leans toward purple ("unswallowed sobs"), though the rhythm is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with high-density imagery ("teardrop of glass"). However, the score is capped by the use of worn clichés ("liquid gold") and the uncredited near-quotation of Leonard Cohen ("cracks were how the light got in") as a concluding profundity, which weakens the otherwise original voice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative and generally controlled, but occasional "purple" phrases ("pulse thrummed... like a second, secret tide") and adverb-heavy constructions ("scintillatingly somber") distract from the clarity. Rhythm and imagery are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished and dense, but relies on several stock phrasings ("wind howled," "skeletal trees," "clear as water") that reduce freshness. The line "shredded into confetti by some overzealous censor’s blade" leans slightly melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.5)
    A significant grammatical error in the climax ("It *drunk* the device" instead of "drank") severely disrupts the immersion of a pivotal moment. Additionally, the simile "bent time like taffy" feels tonally juvenile against the otherwise elevated prose.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("ink the color of storm clouds") and awkward phrasing forced by required elements ("something positively wistful"). These artifacts, combined with the explicit thematic summary, disrupt the line-level polish expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the imagery is generally strong, the prose leans on clichés ("bruised sky," "sunset bled gold," "ragged, wet gasps") and metaphor stacking. The "Logic demanded/Emotion demanded" parallel structure reads as a scaffold artifact rather than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and imagistic, but suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("Lior stood," "Lior knew," "Lior exhaled") that create a monotone cadence. Some metaphors are dense and slightly overwritten ("sculpted from the raw, restless stone"), slowing momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level execution is marred by a significant category error in the climax: "lantern’s light reverberating off the wet stone" (light reflects; sound reverberates). Additionally, the ending suffers from dramatic fragmentation ("So would he," "He climbed") and rhetorical cheese ("And Elias Voss? He remembered") that feels artificial rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from high-density "writerly" artifacts and forced similes ("rhythm like a warden’s footsteps," "steady as a second opinion"). Abstract-concrete clashes ("bled like a promise") and anthropomorphism ("mechanism sighed") obscure clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and image-rich ("rusted prayer," "fractured prophecy"), maintaining strong momentum. The repeated use of "transliterate" (three times) risks feeling like a semantic loop, though it anchors the thematic transformation. The phrase "The acid sea burped" is a tonal risk that lands as "irreverent," though it contrasts sharply with the surrounding high-lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose density is compromised by the paragraphing choice, which breaks momentum and creates a jerky reading experience. Line-level craft shows reliance on stock phrasing ("ghost-light," "angry stars") and vague action ("slotted the crystal... and pulled"—pulled what?), lacking the precision required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of similes ("like old men," "like trapped screams," "like loose thread," "like bones"), creating a scaffolded rhythm. This over-reliance on "like/as" constructions dulls the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally leans on clichés like "trawling for meaning" or "wreckage of other people's lives." The sensory language regarding the silence and the ice is strong, but the metaphorical weight sometimes feels decorative rather than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent but dense with simile ("like embers," "like pleading fingers," "like a knife"), which slows momentum and draws attention to the writing itself. The "overwriting" tendency dilutes the impact of the final action by burying it in descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense ("stating a fact the way the desert states thirst"), with no scaffold artifacts or wasted lines. The reprise of "strangely honest" works well as a structural clasp rather than a repetitive loop.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is polished but saturated with "writerly" clichés and heavy-handed similes ("like a breath held too long," "passed like a torch," "fanned like wings"). The density of figurative language obscures the action, and the rhythm is monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong rhythm ("a silence so profound it hummed"). Some metaphors hover on the edge of being overwrought ("dust that settled like a verdict"), but line-level control is generally high and propulsion is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("swallowing mist," "tasted like static"). Rhythm varies purposefully to match the pacing, particularly in the staccato fragments of the climax ("He ran. Not away. Toward.").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is marred by abstract sensory mixes ("scent of ozone and possibility") and occasional clichés ("faster than thought"). These "poetic" artifacts obscure the immediate physical reality of the scene in favor of vague sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant overwriting and density issues. The text relies heavily on simile chains ("soft as breath," "like a promise," "like rain," "like a secret") that clutter the imagery. The phrase "pulsing stillness" is used twice, creating a repetition artifact. The prose tells the reader how to feel rather than showing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.2)
    The formatting (near-exclusive use of single-sentence paragraphs) is a severe scaffold artifact that destroys prose density and flow. Tonal artifacts like "The Spooning" and clichés like "voice like grinding stones" further degrade the line-level quality. The prose lacks the connective tissue required for a literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished with good density and rhythm ("too small to be human, too sharp to be animal"). There are no significant prose artifacts or scaffolding loops, though some imagery ("eyes like polished river stones") leans toward familiar genre tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is overwritten, with a high density of similes (mist like a serpent, like a cat, flames like tongues) that clutter the imagery. The required phrase "reflectively vibrant" creates an awkward adverb-adjective construction that disrupts the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density ("skeletal arches," "thaw and yield"). A slight over-reliance on adjectival metaphors ("emerald velvet," "honeyed hush") borders on purple, but the line-level propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is competent but marred by clichés ("coiled... like a living thing") and abstract metaphors ("shape of hope") that blur imagery. The phrase "lucidly watchful" feels like an awkward insertion that disrupts the rhythmic flow of the sentence it inhabits.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is grammatical and rhythmic but heavily reliant on clichés ("liquid gold," "half-remembered dream," "forgotten wishes"). These stock phrases reduce the impact of the imagery and suggest a reliance on familiar descriptors over observation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from a high density of simile structures ("like smoke," "like a bridge," "like a promise," "like frost," "like dragonflies," "like embers"), which dilutes the imagery. Additionally, the phrase "breath curling like smoke" is repeated verbatim in the first and penultimate paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from mixed or abstract metaphors ("cellar of his reason," "whispers pressed into glass") that blur clarity for the sake of lyricism. While rhythmically sound, the reliance on standard literary similes ("like ink in water") prevents the style from achieving distinct freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    While vivid, the prose suffers from a repetitive simile cadence ("thick as kelp," "sharp as... chisel," "light as... wing") in adjacent lines, creating a template effect. The adverbial construction "boundary-lessly" is clunky and disrupts the sentence flow.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.3)
    Polished but overwritten in places; phrases like "violation of its wholeness" and "shape of things she would never name" trade concrete impact for vague abstraction. The simile comparing a match strike to a lion's yawn strains physical logic for the sake of motif.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, but suffers from a repetitive reliance on "like" similes (hem, secret, bones, ink, breath) which creates a predictable cadence. While individual images are strong, the structural repetition of the comparisons draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Imagery is generally strong, but the prose relies on a repetitive rhetorical template ("She didn't X. She Y.") three separate times. This recurring cadence creates a rhythmic artifact that feels mechanical and draws attention to the author's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally slows momentum ("like a bird," "like vines," "like a breath"). The specific phrase "petrichor nostalgia" appears as an awkward modifier stack that disrupts the rhythm of the sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.4)
    A significant repetitive artifact ("cut through... like a blade" in para 1, "cutting... like a blade" in para 16) mars the prose. Clichéd similes ("bled like old wounds," "curling... like smoke") and the muddled logic of the sundial metaphor further lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the flow is competent, the prose relies on stock imagery ("pulse stilled," "storm's heart") and cliché personification ("dock groaned," "fog swallowed"). These artifacts flatten the texture and reduce the impact of the more original elements like the seed pod splicing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant "simile overload" artifact: the text relies on "X like Y" constructions in nearly every paragraph ("swallowing... like a sigh," "coiled like a question," "pulsing like a heartbeat"). This repetitive scaffolding creates a droning rhythm and obscures clarity with figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with high density and strong imagery ("wings not feathers but shards of stained glass"). There are minor lapses into abstraction ("old sorrow," "bitter-sweet ache") that tell rather than show, but the line-level craft generally propels the story effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    The phrase "literally and metaphorically" is a significant craft slip, explaining what should be implied. The prompt phrase "migration of clouds" is repeated verbatim in the final reflection, creating an unmotivated echo. "Kelp-drift peace" reads as a forced compound adjective that disrupts the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but marred by stock imagery in key moments ("insects in amber," "spider silk," "burnt sugar"). These clichés dilute the otherwise sharp descriptions and prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies heavily on stock poetic pairings ("cradle and cage," "wound and a blessing," "forgotten promises"). Phrases like "pulsed with the same frequency as her heartbeat" drift into cliché. The reliance on "X of Y" constructions ("petals of ionized gas," "sigh of falling petals") creates a repetitive syntactic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is dense but suffers from a recurring template artifact ("Not [X], but [Y]") used four times to define key elements, creating a repetitive cadence. Some phrasing leans toward purple ("dusk bled," "bruised violet"), slightly dulling the sharpness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative ("brass teardrop," "inscriptions kissing metal"). The imagery supports the weight of the narrative without becoming purple, maintaining momentum through the introspective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence variety and sensory density ("exhaled a breath of damp earth"). However, a few phrases rely on stock imagery ("groaning like old bones," "whispering secrets") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by abstract phrasing ("thick with potential," "edges of possibility") and the awkward insertion of required phrases ("groundedly imaginative act"). The text relies heavily on simile ("like a blade," "like a bloom," "like a flock") which becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("hummed like a forgotten hymn"), with high information density. However, there are minor "workshop" artifacts, specifically abstract similes like "thick as regret," which dilute the physical immediacy of the scene. The imagery is generally strong, but the reliance on [Adjective] [Noun] pairings occasionally creates a lull in momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract-sensory artifacts ("smelled of... old secrets") and stock imagery ("silence hummed... thick as dust motes"). These flourishes obscure the physical reality of the scene with poetic scaffolding that doesn't always pay off in clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery ("slick with ink," "ribs groaned"). A few metaphors lean toward cliché ("rough as rust," "mocking applause"), preventing the highest band, but the writing is efficient and supports the story's gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with adjectival stacking ("expectantly resigned sigh") and mixed metaphors ("bleeding amber... like slow fire"). While the sensory details are evocative, the density of figurative language sometimes draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. The integration of required phrases is generally smooth, though "denote" feels slightly academic in context.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is vivid but suffers from "template cadence" in the form of excessive single-sentence paragraphs ("It was potential," "He hesitated"), creating a stop-start rhythm. The insertion of scientific terminology ("synaptic plasticity") clashes with the otherwise organic/fable lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and readable but relies on stock similes ("rough as bark," "like a struck tuning fork") that reduce freshness. The mechanics are clean, but the imagery plays it safe.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is mechanically polished but suffers from sentimental metaphors ("like a question finally asked") and repetitive "breath/sigh" imagery. The high density of reflective exposition reduces sentence-level propulsion and obscures the immediacy of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally high-quality with dense, evocative imagery ("foxglove-stained glass," "chisel, tap-tap-tapping"). The score is held back by a pattern of stock somatic reactions for the intruder ("breath hitched," "ragged bursts," "fingers convulsed") and the repetitive subject-opener syntax noted in Q6. These artifacts slightly dull the scene's otherwise sharp resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    A conspicuous typo ("The pain was a anchor") disrupts the reading experience. While the rhythm is generally strong, reliance on "telling" blocks for backstory ("Lena was a grim optimist," "She had come here to...") drags the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished, but the integration of the prompt phrase "methodically hopeful" creates a rhythmic stumble ("exhaled, slow and methodically hopeful"). Some figurative language feels ornamental ("windows glowing like embers") rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from grammatical slips at key moments (e.g., "the K swollen, then moved" should be "swelled") and questionable usage ("shards embedded in the wood" as an intransitive action). The density of metaphors sometimes obscures the action, and the summary pacing in the second half drains the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    While evocative, the high density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("bruised violet," "storm's underbelly," "old scars," "like tar," "like smoke") slows the climactic momentum. The reliance on stacked similes occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.0)
    The text contains a clear typo ("clapsing") and relies on repetitive vocabulary ("resuscitation," "clasp"). Some metaphors are overwrought ("rust of old secrets," "dawn broke like a bruise"), reducing line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in almost every sentence. A few images lean slightly purple ("sound bloomed like a bruise," "clouds coiled like unplayed sheet music"), but the rhythm is excellent. The line-level craft successfully sustains the "magic realism" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery like "iron teeth fused by time." However, some phrasings lean toward standard genre metaphors (notes "cracking like a whip") that slightly dilute the otherwise unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors, such as "light like a held breath" and the confusing simile "smooth as a confession booth’s curtain." These artifacts clutter the line-level experience and slow narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("iron teeth locking the past"). There is a slight tendency toward adjectival density and romanticized phrasing ("grief of a poet," "interlaced absence"), but the rhythm is controlled. The integration of required phrases is generally smooth, though occasionally conspicuous.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is polished and readable but relies heavily on stock phrasing ("swallowed the city whole," "ghost of a touch," "blind man reading braille"). While there are no major technical errors, the reliance on familiar metaphors prevents the imagery from achieving high-density impact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is polished, there is a distracting density of similes ("like a breath," "like unspoken promises," "like watercolors," "like silk," "like the last exhale," "like a ship") that creates a repetitive syntactic pattern. This reliance on "like" constructions in high-pressure beats dilutes the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and strong rhythm. A few descriptions ("burnt sugar and copper") are minor genre clichés, but lines like "lightning stitching the ruins" and the final "chorus of protest" demonstrate high craft.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from overwritten metaphors and stock phrasing ("indigo bruise," "whirring like a held breath," "trembling not from cold"). These artifacts obscure clarity and lend a melodramatic air to the proceedings. The oxymoronic "brilliant dimness" feels forced rather than evocative, drawing attention to the writer rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    While polished, the prose suffers from a high density of formulaic similes ("stretched like a bruise," "groaned... like a man," "still as a held breath," "warm as a pulse," "tolled... like a man"). Additionally, repetitive sentence structures ("the way he did when...") appear at key moments, creating a rhythmic artifact that dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant mixed metaphors and vehicle violations appear in peak beats ("moon hung at half-mast" confuses celestial and flag imagery; "furrowed hush" is an opaque abstraction). Clichés like "ghostly fingers" and "drowned... depth" reduce the impact of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose suffers from simile overload ("like unanswered questions," "like a map of scars," "like a rotted hull," "like the jasmine," "like a dying star"). This repetitive "like a [noun]" cadence creates a rhythmic scaffold that detracts from the otherwise strong flow.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative ("swallowed by the tunnel’s throat"). There are minor instances of overwriting ("comet tail of disrupted light," "bioluminescent veins") that skirt the edge of purple prose, but the rhythm and sentence variety maintain good momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished but suffers from a reliance on stock imagery and similes (e.g., "hollow so vast it had its own gravity," "edges blurring like ink in rain"). These artifacts reduce the immediacy of the imagery, though the sentence-level propulsion remains strong and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong and rhythmic but suffers from occasional overwriting and mixed metaphors (e.g., "Moonlight bled... like a forgotten breath"—breath does not bleed; "birth of a silence"). These dense figurative clusters in the opening retard momentum slightly. However, the line-level execution during the climax ("The saucer shattered. The glade exhaled.") is sharp and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("bolted together with the last prayers," "needle was a sliver of black glass"). The rhythm supports the mythic tone without becoming sluggish. A few phrases veer toward the melodramatic ("forgotten how to die"), but the overall craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans toward purple ("molten kiss," "blade of gold"). The repeated use of "whispering hush"—a tautology—and the structural tic "A [noun], then" detract slightly from line-level precision. The imagery is dense but occasionally stifles momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive but suffers from noticeable clichés ("heart hardening like steel in a forge," "heavy as a tombstone") that dull the impact of key moments. While information density is adequate, the reliance on stock metaphors in internal reflection prevents the writing from reaching higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from abstract and mixed metaphors ("slick as a breath held too long," "fine as regret") that obscure sensory reality. These "purple" artifacts reduce the precision required for a story aiming at the highest literary echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is significantly overwritten, with a density of metaphor that suffocates the narrative ("jagged veins," "furiously tranquil," "bruises," "constellations," "confetti"). Almost every sentence carries a figurative load, violating the economy standard and blunting the impact of the key physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    While functional, the prose relies on some clichés ("shattered diamonds," "laugh was a blade unsheathed") that flatten the imagery. The insertion of the "Danish tin sewing needle card" as a five-word noun block creates a rhythmic stumble in the sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting ("silver wound," "clawed free") and a distracting, near-direct lift of a famous Leonard Cohen lyric ("cracks in the world where the light got in"). Figurative language is dense and frequently clichéd, reducing line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("ghost of what could have been," "dying fireflies," "blade of a knife") and heavy-handed similes. This overuse of stock figurative language obscures the immediacy of the action and weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract metaphors and "deepities" ("tasted like the first question ever asked," "tapestry of collective memory") that trade sensory precision for vague profundity. These constructions distance the reader from the physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally relies on clichés ("fingers through a lover’s hair") or slightly opaque metaphors ("sunlight through a held breath"). The "slow-spoken heart" line in the resolution feels precious, but the descriptions of the compass and tree are sharp.

    High density with metaphors (needle from star, breath-thread) patterned early without muddle or loops; propulsion peaks in climax ("needle went in again... ship’s bones sang"), varying rhythm flawless on read-aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with varied rhythm; metaphors consistent (lava kiss, embers breath) without muddle in peak (hurling beat). Minor simile density in opening but purposeful pattern. No loops; propulsion clear to gold sand heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density propels ("bronze quill holder... worn smooth" multi-jobs); rhythm varies, no loops, but figurative density ("lantern... bowstring, forge") borders overwrite in setup without peak harm. Clean propulsion to closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density propels via multi-job lines, but minor figurative density in opening ("slick as a breath held too long") risks overwrite without pattern payoff; no loops, rhythm varies, closure image crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherence (e.g., "sky turned ocean") purposeful for voice, propels to closure without overwriting in peak tear/reset beats.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density propels (e.g., "needle card spinning like thrown coin embeds exactly"); no loops, varied rhythm. Figurative coherent (shadows as diamonds/maps), no muddle in peak strike.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density propels via varied rhythm to "one bloom at a time"; purposeful metaphor cluster ("vines through concrete," "fiercer than fire") charges closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    High density with zero loops or scaffolds; rhythmic variety peaks in "film stuttered to life, images bleeding," propelling to closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops, high density propels revelation beat (e.g., blurred-to-sharpened vision); varied syntax and coherent metaphors like "sap in her veins" maintain propulsion without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    High density in "needle shuddered... bleed color" propels without loops; varied openings and paragraph cadence breathe with scene, metaphors coherent as "tides beneath his ribs."

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold sentences, each image advances character or atmosphere. Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass as teeth, roots as veins—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from stately opening clause to the breath-caught finale “Like the beginning of something he didn’t need to name.” Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, mood, theme). A single tiny filter verb cluster (“he felt something shift”) is voice-motivated and forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: most sentences layer internal, sensory, and symbolic work. Figurative language stays coherent—frost as text, glass as truth—without mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase echo: “pauses” is repeated six times; but repetition is pattern-taught and pays off in closure. No register drift, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: frost-long sentences vs. fragment bursts under pressure. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent (winterglass, heat-map) without mixed vehicles. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) appear but not in peak beats; closure line is clean. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, causal, and emotional work.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence does two jobs—image + motion, sound + cost. Metaphors are spare, never stacked: “edges biting like teeth,” “pulse slow as a sleeping beast.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke; final line is an image that recharges the surface memory. Only microscopic slip: “like a trapped scream” edges toward stock, but the scream never materializes, keeping the metaphor taut.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short pulse—“He didn’t declare”—to extended accumulative chains that mimic basket loads. Metaphors stay physical: bell as dying breath, bread as woven survival, roses as thorn promises; no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new tactical detail. Read-aloud rhythm peaks at twelve rings, then falls to quiet closure without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence can set scent, temperature, myth, and emotional history (“arches wreathed…jasmine…iron left too long”). Figurative logic stays coherent—fog as invitation, breath as filament, river embers as love-sparks. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb clutter. Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing line releases with cadence lift. Microscopic nit: “he exhaled, and the breath…shimmered” could trim second “breath,” but propulsion remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances causality (“vines…surged forward, weaving themselves into a spiral staircase”)—with zero paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“hyperbolic geometry”) is justified by the POV’s professional lexicon and never muddies the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variation is organic; paragraph lengths visually mimic breath—short at vault breach, longer at sowing cadence. No synonym loops; “seed” never padded with near-doubles. Mixed metaphors avoided—concrete “jagged scar” stays physical. Middle-C resonance pays off causally; no decorative figuration. Copy clean: pronouns unambiguous, tense stable, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“water seeped… emerald and blood”). Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “the way…” anaphora at climax is deliberate pattern, not loop. Read-aloud ear passes—sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts carry emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose carries high density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic information without purple drift. Varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay physical (glass, ice, melt). One paraphrase loop: “the thaw would come for this too” closely echoes earlier “the thaw had come,” but it is intentional reprise, not scaffold. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong information density: one sentence often does three jobs (e.g., “The title mocked her” advances theme, reveals history, tightens stakes). Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence runs. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“sky thick with stars” mirrors ledger’s name-cluster. Minor paraphrase loop on “adaptation” concept (−0.2) but does not touch closure. Clean proofing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—gold leaf as snow, silence as wound/cradle—without mixed logic. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, body, and concept. Minor scaffold: “the way” repeats three times in mid-section; does not touch closure. Closure image crisp: “gold leaf…glinted once in the memory of light.”

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean-lyric: every clause either advances sensor data or refracts image. Figurative language kept sparse; when used (“stars blinking like pins in a cosmic board”) it’s anchored to robot’s mapping instinct. No scaffold/loop, no mixed metaphors, no register drift. Final line “ice sang” is monosyllabic percussive payoff—clarity intact, momentum releases.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ear-test strong: sentence lengths swell and contract with emotional tide. Information density high—one line can plant lens, backstory, and metaphor simultaneously. One paraphrase loop: “not secrets. Not lies.” is purposeful refrain, not scaffold. Occasional soft modifiers (“something luminous”) slightly dilute peak beat; keeps it from 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet airy: each sentence layers garden imagery with emotional charge (“breath curling around a marble”) while avoiding metaphor clutter; no loops, no filter stacks, final line (“so was she”) lands with rhythmic poise.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer job, sensation, concept without scaffold: “He adjusted the magnetic nexus with fingers that remembered every bolt… time didn’t just move forward.” Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught (twilight, wings, sideways), and never muddles causality. No loops, paraphrase, or template cadence in final third. Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentences for awe, fragments for beats. Copy clean; no tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—one sentence delivers object, metaphor, and emotional turn: “the dampness making the fibers soft as skin.” Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence. Metaphors are coherent: water as tongue, pit as throat, silence as vessel. No register drift. Final line—“Some conversations didn’t need words to be finished”—earns its quietude through prior sonic imagery. Prop tracking clean: program starts wet, ends dry; bow starts tool, becomes crowbar, returns to instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm accelerates from languid reflection to staccato exit; sentence variety supports breath vs. gale. Figurative language is selective—“storm unspool itself,” “paper soft as a pulse”—and never muddies causality. No scaffold loops; each image advances state or stakes. Minor overgrowth: “weight of what she didn’t say could never capsize the world” is slightly abstract; still, the line is isolated and quickly grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence propulsion high: figurative density surfaces only at key beats (“tunnel exhaled damp”) and is patterned, not scatter-gun. No mixed metaphors; valve-as-jaw holds physical logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances knowledge or texture. Minor scaffold: over-fondness of em-dash phrases in radio snippets, but artifacts fall outside closure third, so 9+ pathway intact.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is mostly loop-free; a few soft repeats (“they had…they had…”) but not in peak beats. Metaphors stay coherent—river as tongue, dust as language—no mixed vehicles. Density high; most lines do two jobs (image + character state). Occasional elevated diction (“regenerative silence,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift but fits lyric mode and does not obscure causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose loop-free, high-density; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are organic—roots drinking rain, thread of spun gold—and stay within acoustic palette. Rhythm modulates from long pastoral lines to staccato eclipse clauses without algorithmic pattern. No strained register in peak beats; “ordinary magic” leans therapeutic but is earned by prior dramatization. Final line avoids uplift cliché, landing on inhalation imagery that mirrors the story’s first gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence length contracts around the tilt-beat. Metaphors are selective (“colossal phonograph”) and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—each sentence layers setting, motion, and metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; no template cadence detected. Minor filter-verb stack in “the walls remembered” line, but immediacy recovers in next clause; not in closure third, so 9+ still attainable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Figurative load is high but patterned early—“beam sliced through the dark like a blade” teaches the cutting motif, later reprised in sonic shattering. No mixed metaphors; each image extends the lighthouse/optic axis. Scaffolding is minimal: one paraphrase loop (“the way you…”) is purposeful anaphora, not artifact. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward the final metallic stub. Copy-error clean: tense stable, pronouns anchored, no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, stakes, and sound. Metaphors stay consistent—palette, pedal, indigo—avoiding mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“the silence was softer… clearer… alive”) is deliberate pattern reinforcement, not artifact. Final line lands with crystalline clarity, no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety and sensory density are high; most lines do double duty (ink bleeding into treble clef shape). One scaffold lapse: “the weight of what he hadn’t yet written” is immediately restated as “the silence is not empty,” a near-paraphrase loop that dulls momentum. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles—and diction stays within a fortune-writer’s idiom. Final line breathes cleanly, satisfying the read-aloud ear, but the loop costs a tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences perform double duty—each image advances atmosphere, choice, or body-state: “the rain’s afterglow bleeding into something thicker, something hungry.” No scaffold loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (glass shatters in reverse, stone holds). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Two near-adjacent “something” clauses are the only micro-repetition, not severe enough to dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with tension: long exhalations in greenhouse, staccato smashes in shop, locomotive roll on platform. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative density peaks at uncorking but remains coherent—scent “hit him like a blade” leads to concrete notes (earth, sugar, coin) that braid later into theme. One minor filter verb cluster (“He understood now”) forgiven by immediacy of soil-digging reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “rope hummed… not with sound but with pattern” fuses object and concept in one line. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to knife-short cuts. Two near-adjacent “pattern” repeats are purposeful, not loops. No mixed metaphors; closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences that mirror bow strokes and clipped fragments at rustle-alert. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds either sensory density or causal cue. Figurative control precise: “ribs of forgotten beasts” is fresh, not mixed. Final line—“the chronic hush, at last, learned to sing”—is a clean, resonant closure cadence. Minor −0.1 for one adjective stack (“damp air”) that could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—amber as held breath, light as heartbeat—without muddle. Information-dense lines do double duty: “its fragrance unfolding like a story told backward” advances both scent and theme. Zero loops or scaffold; final paragraph breathes without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean: “ledger balanced a little less neatly” does double duty—financial and moral. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional lyrical lift (“music in the spaces between the notes”) is earned by prior acoustic motif. Rhythm breathes with scene shifts; final sentence lands on stressed monosyllable for hush effect.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature: long clause for orchard shimmer, staccato for crater descent. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors per beat—avoiding density penalty. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. Opening and closing lines perform mirror-work with “whisper / invitation,” giving structural echo without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “pendant…hummed against her collarbone whenever the city’s rhythm faltered” packs exposition into sensory hit. No loops; each sentence advances image, action, or rule. Metaphors (time as ink, canals as veins) stay coherent and mutually reinforcing. Final line “And the echoes—well. They were only just beginning to speak” lands with sparse propulsion, recharging silence motif.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. Figurative language is selective, never dense in peak beats—only two metaphors in the mist-reach moment, both physically coherent. Information density is high: one sentence often does two jobs (“The glass eyes dovetailed… locking like puzzle pieces”). Zero paraphrase loops, no synonym churn, no scaffold. Minor simultaneity in “pressing his forehead… the glass eyes digging” is physically plausible. Opening and final lines serve as anchor and resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the tape spun in the erratic breeze, the laugh spilling out in fragments—high, then broken, then clear as a bell.” No synonym loops; each sensory stroke is new. Minor metaphor overlap: “bled” dawn & “raw and bright” eyes both traffic light-injury imagery, but压缩 within one sentence, not a pattern. Read-aloud ear passes: cadence modulates with breathless retreat vs. luminous emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: one sentence often layers botanic precision, metaphor, and interior turn (“roots split the old stone path… as collaborators”). No loops or scaffold; each image advances. Metaphors are coherent within plant logic—“beeswax” for softened leaf—never mixed. Final line (“leaf by leaf, cell by cell”) uses repetition to create cadence payoff, not filler.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies: long sensory lines vs. staccato revelations (“He pressed the amber. / The stone floor groaned.”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is spare and precise—“wound scabbed over by time,” “fossilized map”—no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers propulsion outward. Minor scaffold in “the alternative was staring at another blank canvas” could be compressed, but it sets up the later canvas beat.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each figurative vehicle (starlight in tar, wet-silk shadows) is single, sharp, paid off. High density: “violet bled into humming air” does world, time, mood in eight words. Rhythm accelerates toward touch, exhales into longer cadence at exit. No artifacts in closure beat; final sentence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: every sentence performs double duty (image + pressure). No loops or template cadence; openings vary from participial to noun-clause. Metaphor vehicles (cobbles as book-spines, lanterns as fallen stars) stay internally consistent and pay off at closure. Information density high—e.g., “ledger of the harbor’s silences” compresses twenty years into four words without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective, never clotted. Only minor scaffold—“the tool was cold, its mechanism silent”—adds slight redundancy. Propulsion remains high; information density strong; no mixed metaphors or loops obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line craft is dense: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic freight without purple drift. Rhythm breathes—paragraph breaks mirror tide pull; no template cadence detected. Metaphors (space “stretches— not outward, but inward”) remain coherent, grounded in tile/tower mechanics. Minor scaffold: “the tile’s weight… felt like an answer” and later “felt like a pulse” reuses ‘felt’ but doesn’t obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image or stakes. High density: “walls shifting between violet and bruise-blue” fuses color + motion + danger in one stroke. No register drift; diction stays within immortal lexicon. Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentence swells, then clipped fragment “He dropped the fragment.” Closure sentence is clean, propulsive, image-locked.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density: “porcelain surface streaked with the ghosts of names” does three jobs in one clause. One metaphor stack at shatter beat is purposeful, pattern-taught, so spared penalty. No loops, no scaffold. Tense stable, pronouns clean. Final line ear-test perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short breath-fog fragments to longer, lamp-buzz clauses, propelling the quiet beat. Figurative layering is dense but patterned: every metaphor is rooted in stationery or botany (gilded leaf, brass pendulum), avoiding mixed-vehicle clutter. One paraphrase loop—“another fragment, another texture, another life”—is stylistically purposeful, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense, zero scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for syrupy time, fragments for heartbeat insomnia. “Some poisons were meant to be absorbed” recharges the faded warning into gold without overwriting. Only micro-slip: “thick and syrupy” abuts “time into something thick,” a faint echo, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentence often layers tactile, sonic, and metaphysical data. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Mixed metaphor check safe—constellation/ledger/mural braid into one mapping metaphor. Final third clean of artifacts; cadence slows to match blank-shell silence. Opening sentence could trim one adjective for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density: one sentence can set, act, and emotion (“She’d pried it loose… burned like a guilty secret”). Occasional modifier stacks (“labyrinthine charm”, “sterile grids”) flirt with overwriting but stay within POV lexicon. No loops; rhythm rises toward staccato final paragraph, matching urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Each click was a theft, a defiance, a way to hoard beauty” compresses moral, emotional, and plot motion. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay lunar-apt—“ghosts of light,” “sun’s first knife-edge.” Information density peaks in the triplet beats of glow/click/dawn without paraphrase loops. Final line earns its lyric lift because prior scaffolding (sand, shadow, photograph) has paid the semantic mortgage.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density high—“chipped teacup, its glaze worn smooth by years of nervous handling” shows history, tremor, economy in one stroke. Metaphors consistent (sound-as-light, whisper-through-metal) and physically coherent. No loops or synonym churn. Only hairline slip: “dreams needed more than ambition; they needed patience” leans proverbial, slightly register-elevated for taciturn Elias, but occurs mid-story, not in closure beat, so −0.2, still within 9 range.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm impeccable; sentence variety and paragraph breath match sonic arc. No loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative density high but patterned—each metaphor is sonic or geological, sustaining coherence. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Only micro-slip: “weight heavier than it should have been” is vague, but it’s first beat and immediately grounded by temple-press test. Closure beat crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and plot data. Metaphors are coherent (signal = dying heartbeat; hush = frayed silk). One paraphrase loop: “she pressed her wrist to her nose and breathed deep” echoes prior perfume beat but earns reprise by charging the final loneliness. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold clutter in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “the lattice stuck—not by nail or glue, but by some hungrier affinity” simultaneously advances plot, deepens setting, and characterizes Elias’s fatalism. No loops or synonym churn; “scuffs worn smooth by decades of hesitant fingers” is specific, irreplaceable. One mixed-metaphor risk—“lighthouse stood like a rusted needle in the throat of the sea”—but the image is taught early, repeated in reef-teeth, so coherence survives. Closure line “Just the light” is taut, propulsive, ear-perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “ashen-veil trailing over blackened vines” does three jobs (visual, motion, poison). No loops; each metaphor extends plant logic. Sentence variety opens with participle, noun phrase, em-dash break. Final line cadence echoes opening wound-image, sealing circle. Zero scaffold or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences carry sensory, emotional, and mythical weight (“brine and the scent of rusted iron”). Metaphors stay coherent—labyrinth as loom, illustration as needle—without purple overlay. Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Rhythm accelerates at the Heart Chamber beat, then exhales into the dawn line, propelling closure. Opening and final lines are ear-tested for cadence; both satisfy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative layering (“stone … hollowed like a wound”) is controlled to one per high-pressure beat, avoiding purple drift. No synonym loops; “roots” recurs but each time with new action (snake, guide, tremble). Opening and final lines are image-anchors that bracket the arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long sensory coils and crisp verb-driven clauses, propelling the procedural pace. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—each image (neon ghosts, binary dust) is anchored to Lena’s tool-based worldview. No scaffold loops; every paragraph advances choice or texture. Minor over-pack in “chrome-and-glass skeleton” but it clears before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: caesuras mirror telescope clockwork, em-dashes enact thread tugs. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—mixed metaphors (“bruise against the sky,” “fabric of the cosmos”) accumulate into a single textile-astronomy imagery system. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances loom-state or stakes. Minor scaffold: “the flame wasn’t just light; it was a voice” edges toward thesis restatement but is saved by immediate sensory payoff in the broadcast beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is assured; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high—one line often layers sensory data, metaphor, and interior cue. Two micro-loops: “the shard healed… her skin do the same” and “the mangroves sighed… Liora hummed along” are intentional parallelism, not artifact. No mixed metaphors; clarity intact at closure. A minor scaffold phrase “the spirits’ song” appears thrice with identical noun phrase could tighten, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, zero filter-verb stacks; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors interlock: bruise-glass → violet/gold, ivy-barbed wire, coral-sea memory—no mixed vehicle. High density: “fingers tracing jagged edge of brain coral fragment—salvaged from wreckage off Mindanao” performs three jobs (tactile, backstory, occupation) in nineteen words. Closure line “embers cupped in careful hands” is precise, unclichéd, rhythmically cadenced. No scaffolding; even twilight colors earn their keep by charging final glow.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are purposeful—moss like “memory half-forgotten,” joy “leaking into the air like perfume”—and internally coherent. Information density high: “she knelt, brushing…with fingers already stained” simultaneously reveals action, backstory, and sensory detail. Final line “began to mix new paints” offers crisp cadence that recharges opening motif of pigments.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence advances image or stakes. One paraphrase loop (“again… Again?”) is purposeful, pattern-taught. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Final third remains clean, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: horticultural Latinate nouns alternate with Anglo-Saxon verbs (“split”, “split”, “split open” refrain mimics rattle). Information density high—one sentence can world-build, advance plot, and plant sensory hook: “city pulsed with the sterile glow of compliance, its citizens feeding their thoughts into the mandatory Neural Ledgers like coins into a toll booth.” Mixed metaphor check clean. Minor template cadence in triple “the x of y” constructions mid-story; none appear in final third, so no 9+ disqualification. Pronoun and tense spotless.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is lush yet controlled; no paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Metaphors interlock: nebula petals, coral helmet, poppies from rifles—each vehicle extends prior physics without contradiction. Information density high: one sentence nets the sun, borrows light, seeds children. Only hairline slip: “reef-shadow joy” is coined without tactile anchor, but cadence absorbs it. Read-aloud ear test passes; varied sentence openings, no drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: varied sentence lengths, no template cadence, zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors integrated into action—“ink that whispered when stirred” does double sensory work. Information density high; every sentence advances mood or plot. Minor overworld risk in stacked perfume imagery (“ozone and foxglove regret”) but justified by peak moment. Final line lands with echoing monosyllables that mirror content.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear registers purposeful cadence—three-stress anaphora (“Here is what was lost… Here is what we reclaim”) without monotony because of interleaved sentence length. Information density high: “the archive wasn’t a tomb—it was a loom” performs three jobs (metaphor, stake-shift, world-rule). No mixed metaphors; violet scent recurs but never clots. One near-loop: “The point was…” refrain appears three times; it pays off thematically so allowed, but keeps score sub-9. Line clarity remains intact at closure; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence = glue language, generational guilt, and decrypt method. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors disciplined — “volcano’s ribs,” “chain like a promise” — no mixed vehicles. Final line cadence mirrors inhale/exhale, sonic payoff of earlier “breathed.” Occasional adjective clusters (“dappled light slanting”) forgiven for texture under low-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry multi-duty density: “He balanced the meteorite on his fingertip, watching the particles shift as if directed by an unseen conductor” fuses object handling, wind prediction, and metaphor in one clause. No paraphrase loops; each dust or music image returns with altered stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent—meteorite as star, ledger as score—avoiding mixed-vehicle clutter. Final line “Some paper trails were meant to be rewritten” reframes prior motifs without preachiness, earning its abstract noun through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templates. A few overwritten figurations—“light like poorly aimed scissors,” “rows bent inward like a held sigh”—but they do not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information density high: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and motivation. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “like” similes could compress; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences layer time, metaphor, and physics (“glass domes cracked but still holding back the Pacific’s slow, insistent weight”). No synonym loops; each metaphor is single-use and precise. Rhythm accelerates into the final spiral, then exhales with the shared breath. Only microscopic slip: “softly ingenious” is marginally elevated diction for Elara’s lexicon, but it occurs in low-pressure narration and is earned by context.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: one sentence often twins sensory image with metaphysical map—‘crater glass wasn’t just a relic; it was a map.’ No synonym loops or scaffold; each return of “iridescent” gains new cargo. Occasional poetic elevation (“cheerful gloom lullaby”) risks purple, but the rhythm justifies the lift. Line-level craft supports the accumulative lens without clogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, information-dense; most lines do two jobs (e.g., “cobblestones slick with the retreat of the evening tide” sets both scene and time-clock). Figurative language is selective—no metaphor clutter during peak beat. Minor template cadence in three “He…then he…” sentences, but not enough to dull propulsion. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges motif. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; copy clean.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence either advances image or tightens the weave. Figurative density is extreme yet never muddled—vehicles stay internally consistent (tide, star, blade, map). Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke. Minor hairline: “obsidian grace” risks purple, but the phrase is earned by the knife-sharp garden world already built.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence layers job, sense, and metaphor: “the wood groaning like an old man’s bones” fuses dock, body, time. Information density high—one line can place tide, tool, and emotional state. Figurative logic consistent: light = memory, mist = erasure, stone = agency. No artifact touches the closure beat; final line is clean, auditory, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the ridge ascent; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse enough that each metaphor (moonlight silvering needles like bones, cracks as veins) lands cleanly without cluttering the closure beat. Information density is high: one sentence often does scenic, tactile, and emotional work. Only minor loop: “before the divorce, before the fire, before the silence” is deliberate anaphora and reads as patterned rather than accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; metaphor count is high yet patterned from start, earning density. Occasional template cadence (“the next breath, the next wave, the next pattern”) loops rather than advances; trim would sharpen. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final third keeps clarity—gauge crack and sideways needle land cleanly. Read-aloud rhythm mostly varies; a few parallel triplets drum.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, no scaffold loops, metaphors coherent (“film curled like a dead thing” marries fragility + death). Sentence length breathes—long breath for atmosphere, staccato for strike-light ignition. Only one tiny paraphrase loop: “weight of legacy pressed down… heavier than the stone” could compress, but it does not touch closure. Read-aloud ear test passes with rhythm variation intact.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the prism parapet refracting the dying light into fractured rainbows that bled across the damp flagstones” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, cost, or stakes. A single mixed vehicle—“ghost of his fear”—is minor enough not to dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: “ink dark as terraces’ shadows” does three jobs (color, time, mood). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stake or image. Metaphors (clipboard = polished grief) stay coherent. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long river sentences to clipped fragments at climax. Final line “for now, that was enough” lands with cadence-earned breath.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances salt, body, or stake. Metaphors stay coherent—cracks as veins, thunder as listener—without mixed vehicles. High density: “the slow violence of a drought he had helped manufacture” compresses history, culpability, and methodology in ten words. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the approaching storm; no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers tactile detail and symbolic charge—“snow slid…silent avalanche”—without overlap. Figurative language is patterned early (light as shattered glass) and pays off in closure image. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Only hairline slip: “a harvest of echoes trapped in glass” edges toward abstraction, but is immediately grounded by voices touching skin. Final line is crisp, propulsive, and recharges opening snow metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines—“air smelled of damp wool and old paper, the kind of quiet that follows a shouting match”—do triple duty. No scaffold loops; only microscopic paraphrase hiccup (“quiet that follows…quiet that arrives”). Metaphors stay coherent: stick as lightning-branch, dome as sigh. Final paragraph’s meteor hush is crisp, luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long, breath-held clauses and fragment-like beats that mimic knotting motions. Figurative density is high yet purposeful—every metaphor is drawn from Lior’s tool-set (veins=wing, echo=question). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. A single mixed metaphor (“melody losing its notes”) is minor enough to leave the closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: clauses lengthen during kneading, shorten at tremor. Information density high—one sentence can braid time, tool, and myth. No loops, no scaffold; metaphors stay physically coherent (ice weeps, rope glows). One register spike—“transcribed…into the sanctum’s bones”—leans academic, but the voice justifies the arcane lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty—“the bunker had been swallowing its own echoes for decades” sets tone, history, and metaphor. Zero loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (metal dissolving into vines sustains physical logic). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally: "sandals whispering...where kings had once strode" balances sibilance against hard consonants. Information density high—single sentences layer palace decay, personal frugality, and astronomical vocation. Figurative language is selective: "stone groaned, then split like a fruit" is brief yet visceral; no metaphor pile-up in peak beat. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Final sentence lands on monosyllabic punch: "He smiled, adjusted his lens, and returned to work"—propulsive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled, with sentence variety avoiding template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—walls breathing, silence as wool—without purple overload. Only minor scaffold: “thick as wool, heavy as regret” is a doublet that could lose one half. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; information density high (one line often carries memory, object, and sensory work).

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the beat—long inhalation clauses, sharp exhale fragments—without algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is selective: frost as shattered glass, sky as door; no mixed metaphors or purple stacks. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold; information density stays high. A single near-split infinitive (“began the work of recreation”) is negligible; otherwise copy-clean.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences perform double duty ("The orchard shivered. A door appeared.") and metaphor stays precise ("trees grew in the shape of questions"). The final line’s quiet diction—"She ate it."—delivers propulsive closure without figurative muddle, meeting the high-band quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence can world-build, foreshadow, and embody (“petals curling inward as if retreating from a truth they’d already revealed”). Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses mirror shifting aisles, then clipped fragments at the door. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “like” similes cluster in two adjacent lines early; does not dull closure. Opening and final lines ear-test clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    High-density lyricism without filler: one sentence shifts setting, stakes, and tactile detail (“The card drank the ink like a thirsty ghost, the name bleeding into its fibres until the paper was blank”). Rhythm accelerates into fragment bursts as ship sinks, then widens for garden coda. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Register stays inside fairy-tale diction, never drifts into academic gloss. Closure line—“It was a door”—earns its monosyllabic punch by contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long incense-laden clauses to short declarative punches (“The door opened.”) that mirror gear-stutters. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—each metaphor (rope as ritual, wax as law) constrains later action, so density is earned. No loops or scaffold; information density high—one sentence often layers smell, tactile motion, and archival inference. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” diction in narration—does not contaminate POV, occurs once, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. High information density: “fractures spiraled inward, a whisper of resistance” simultaneously shows pattern, stakes, and sensory cue. Figurative language is internally coherent (storm→lullaby) and paid off. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks, no template cadence. Opening and closing lines mirror question-and-answer structure, creating satisfying bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: metaphorical stacks ("glass worn thin by centuries of salt wind") advance atmosphere without clogging beats. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence adds tactile or temporal layer. Filter verbs are minimal; when used ("she heard it: the thread") they serve rhythmic pause, not distancing. One clause borders purple ("quiet so old it predated sound") yet fits the heightened moment; it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory data, metaphor, and concept without redundancy. No paraphrase loops; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple drift—vehicles stay coherent (clouds as smoke, flags as shards, hush as river). Opening and closing lines are ear-tested strong; final line’s monosyllabic snap (“that was enough”) lands cleanly. Micro-scaffold appears only once (“the flags didn’t hold answers—only echoes”) but serves as pivot, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence lengths vary to mirror rocket arc. Figurative language is disciplined—one striking image per beat, no metaphor pile-ups. “World was heavier than it had been yesterday. But so was she” lands with punch. No scaffolding loops; every line advances.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Figurative layering is high but patterned (drip/ripple/shell) so density penalty waived. No mixed metaphors; each vehicle extends aqueous logic. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “humming potential”) stays within chronicler’s reflective register. Only minor scaffold: “She didn’t” paragraph echo; clipped repetition functions as deliberate pause beat, not artifact. Final line lands clean, no loops near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often performs world-rule, sensory hit, and emotional tilt (“The silence inside the bloom was the flavor of a held note…”). Figurative layering is purposeful—each metaphor extends the acoustic taste motif—so density cap waived. Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Minor scaffold: “they returned” used twice in adjacent lines could compress, but artifact does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences perform scene-work, atmosphere, and metaphor (“The gondola rocked gently, synchronized with the vial’s pulse”). Figurative language is selective, never clotted; no mixed metaphors. One template cadence: “Somewhere, a door closed. / Somewhere, a breath was taken.”—but patterned parallelism is intentional, taught early, and paid off in hush. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraph cuts land on perceptual pivots. Clean grammar; pronoun “it” always resolves to nearest sensible antecedent.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. A few metaphor clusters border on excess (“dying star,” “kaleidoscope,” “lover’s invitation”) but pattern is taught early and paid off in shattered mirror, so tolerable. No loops or scaffold; opening and closing lines anchor voice and payoff cleanly. One simultaneity bump—“she whispered…then walked away”—splits sequential actions; could trim “then.” Otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density—every sentence layers scent, texture, metaphor—yet no mixed metaphors or register drift. One paraphrase loop (“bridges weren’t meant to be crossed… burned so thoroughly”) is forgiven because it coils back as thematic echo. Closure line is uncluttered, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: single sentences weld sensory, symbolic, causal jobs (“bolt grew warm. In her pocket…”). Varied rhythm; no template cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent (pressure peels like skin). One micro-loop: “mushrooms dimmed, then flared” is purposeful escalation, not churn. No filter-verb stacks. Final line varietal sentence length lands cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence shapes tighten under discovery beats. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective (“skin of a molting serpent” appears once at high-pressure beat). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. Minor overworld near “symphony of scholars” but it’s brief and serves tone; does not disturb closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Almost every sentence layers image + motion + meaning: “blossom shivered… into half-remembered oath.” No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (sky as silk, threads as manacles then wings). One clause drifts toward ornate (“echo of a color no human eye had named”) but the excess is brief and pattern-taught. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breath to staccato final sentence, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density: single sentences twin sensory anchoring with emotional charge—“yellowed paper and the faint, sour tang of old coffee left too long.” No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; each line advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors (“dust patterns settle like fallen snow”) are precise, not mixed, and payoff in closure cadence. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beat shifts; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Clean copy—no typos, pronoun drift, or scaffold sentences—meets 9+ zero-artifact standard.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies, openings avoid algorithmic drums, and density is high: one line often marries image, memory, and stakes. Occasional poetic abstractions (“liquid memory,” “pretty lie under the sun”) verge on mixed metaphor yet remain legible; the final “the line held” lands crisply, no loop obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic control mirrors musical phrasing; sentences shorten as “hush” tightens. Only minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed, appeared”) in mid-section; no loops or mixed metaphors, imagery stays coherent under closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—each metaphor (sky like parchment, moonstone like dragonfly wing) appears once and serves immediacy. Information density is high: one sentence often advances atmosphere, character, and world-rule simultaneously. No scaffold or artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with tension: long, winding clauses in greenhouse descent, then staccato release on surfacing. Information density high—each sentence does two jobs (image + causality). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay physically coherent. One near-muddle: “language of echoes that shaped themselves into questions” risks abstraction, but the next line grounds it with the tinkerer’s laugh, keeping propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in 19 words. Metaphors are physically coherent: “golden vein threading seams” keeps metallurgic logic. Final line “She picked up her tools, and began” is propulsive brevity after lyric swell—rhythmic exhale without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence scatters petals while naming emotional consequence. Metaphors (“jagged teeth of the cliffs”) are sparse, taught early, and re-accessed at closure. No paraphrase loops; adjacent lines advance distinct sensory or causal information. Register remains within Liora’s plausible lexicon—no latinate inflation. Read-aloud cadence varies: sibilants for mist, plosives for punchline. Closure sentence is crisp, unadorned, letting the repurposed echo deliver the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: one sentence carries sensory, emotional, and symbolic load (“He braced both hands… vibrating up his arms”). Rhythm breathes—long sentence for forest inhalation, staccato for strap snap. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors mutually coherent (UV light → gold, silence → math). Opening line anchors voice & stakes; final line resolves by image. Tense stable, pronouns clear, no typos. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is rhythmically varied; sentence lengths contract around the lens-slotting beat to mimic breath-catch. Metaphors are dense (“trapped storm”, “music in the groan”) yet consistent with alchemic-market surrealism, avoiding mixed-vehicle clutter. No paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new sensory angle or conceptual nudge. Occasional elevated diction—“crystallized final moment”, “conceptual repricing”—edges toward academic register but stays within Lior’s translator-intellect frame.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is selective—“dust motes hung suspended like tiny, forgotten acrobats”—and never clusters in peak beats. Information density strong: one sentence slips who/where/when into smell and sight. Minor over-adjectiving (“vast, silent mechanism”) but imagery remains concrete; no mixed metaphors. Closure line is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned—each image (frost-veins, liquid time, starlight shards) recurs with accrued meaning, avoiding purple drift. Rhythm accelerates into single-line paragraphs at rupture, matching glass collapse. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are kinetic—“shuddered,” “thrashed,” “shattered.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves with sonic echo (“rustle” answering “whisper”).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—time as rope, shard as pulse—without self-contradiction. Information density is high: one sentence places the asteroid, revolt, and Elias’s vocation. Minor scaffold: “the shard… the shard… the shard” triplet in paragraph 4 could prune. No mixed metaphors, no register drift. Final line “it was beautiful, after all. And it was his.” lands clean, recharging earlier “poetry” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to fragment punches—“It gave him the light. / All of it.”—mirroring the chamber’s hum-to-scream curve. Metaphor vehicles stay consistent: music, rust, light, fire; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence can anchor time, reveal backstory, and foreshadow burn. Only minor scaffold: “the stone wasn’t meant to be free” restates prior gist; does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; every descriptor does double duty (“water…black and still as a held breath” both paints and foreshadows the upcoming inversion). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The single clause “hinged awakenings” is allowed as pattern-teached lyric compression. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line—“He started collecting silence instead”—delivers the crisp, irreplaceable closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Light spilled out—not forward, but sideways” advances action and motif in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (net, cement, basket) is purposeful, not purple. Only minor slip: “like a choir of lost things” edges toward familiar, but storm context justifies.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: strong verbs ("shivered," "unfurled"), varied cadence, minimal scaffold. Occasional soft intensifiers ("thick and sweet") flirt with overwriting yet serve atmosphere. No loops, mixed metaphors, or filter stacks. High information density; each sentence advances image or interior shift.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: single sentences do triple duty (“The water was warm, thick with the weight of stories never told”). Metaphors are consistent—liquidity, salt, mirrors—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for drift, staccato for skiff descent. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffold: “pulse hammered in his throat” is familiar, but occurs pre-closure and doesn’t dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new sensory or causal information. Figurative language is sparse, precise: lanterns “bobbed like fireflies” once—image earned by earlier phosphorescent tide. No mixed metaphors; bottle as crucible sustains physical logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line resolves by action that recharges bottle motif. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating crowd-noise.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variation is organic: long breath-sentences under frost, staccato beats during crack and push. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (unfurled, squirming, erupted, threaded). One mixed metaphor—“like a wound healing in reverse”—but it is brief and the physical logic (cap edges softening) remains intact. Zero loops or scaffold; every line either advances image, stakes, or memory. Final line is a perfect ear-test: monosyllables mimic the leaf’s first tear.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent motion; sentence length modulates from long spiral clauses to staccato test pulls. Figurative layer is spare—metaphors of stitching, blades, marrow—each anchored to physical task. One paraphrase loop (“the valley would hear… the valley would understand”) is forgiven because it cadences the ending refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, metaphor, and micro-action. No loops or scaffold; figurative stack (“veins of starlight,” “bridge between the fallen and the yet-to-be”) stays coherent because physical logic of light-through-cracks is maintained. Final line breathes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work—“fingers traced… stained glass box… fractured… amber and crimson—colors that once mimicked… colony.” No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances charge or knowledge. Metaphors (wax tears, tuning-fork bones) are consistent, non-contradictory. One minor register lift: “conceptual or social cost even if the emotional price is oblique” floats toward academic at climax; still, it’s brief and the final concrete handprint grounds it. Typography clean, pronoun tracking flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the air…hummed with a quiet, stubborn energy” compresses atmosphere and stakes in one clause. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent—capsule “split open like an overripe fruit” tracks to the loom metaphor without contradiction. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line resolves by auditory image that recharges the garage-sale bell.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple, sentence lengths varied; imagery is dense yet information-bearing. One paraphrase loop detected: “incomplete… broken… imperfect” iterated within four lines, but it serves pattern, not padding. Metaphors (lagoon as bruise healing, feather as prism) cohere spatially; no mixed vehicles. Line-level artifacts are minor and do not touch closure; momentum stays fluid to the final image. A single pruning pass could excise the loop and elevate to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances wire, wire, wire toward mortal crescendo. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“copper oxidized just enough to feed”—no mixed vehicles. Opening line drop-forges mythic authority without purple clutter. Final paragraph’s “orchard whispered” risks cliché but is earned by thirty years of prior breath imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new sensorium or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and internally coherent—“broken rib,” “green vengeance”—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one line anchors jetty, battlefield era, and reef death. Final paragraph rhythm contracts to single-sentence beats, accelerating toward closure without drum-beat monotony. No filler, no filter stacks, no register drift; even “concord” fits the coachman’s arcane lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is densely imagistic yet propulsive; nearly every sentence couples observation to motion. Occasional poetic overlap—“distance is a wound… the wound can be a bridge”—is purposeful parallelism, not synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent (no mixed vehicles). Minor filter-verb clusters (“Rook’s ears twitched,” “Rook’s claws flexed”) are brief and cadence-driven, not momentum-killing. Final lines achieve Charged Poise without syntactic muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work—e.g., “curved glass still holding against the void” does setting, stakes, and body in one stroke. Figurative control: stars “unwinding into threads” extends textile metaphor without mixed-vehicle clash. One scaffold loop: “the silence so deep it echoed” is borderline paraphrase but serves cadence; forgiven under lyric license. Zero filter-verb stacks; action verbs drive.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but each image performs double duty: the sundial lid is both heirloom and key; the knight’s weight is confession and map. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed metaphor risk—“sky twisting like a wound” alongside “sun bled violet”—but the pattern is taught early and holds. Closure image of the first right star is uncluttered, letting the metaphor land.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often conflates world-rule, emotion, motion—“She pressed the bishop into her palm until it bit.” Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths pulse with tension. Figurative layer sustained but never muddled; metaphor vehicles (penumbra as silk/teeth) stay within physics of swallowing light. Only minor scaffold: whisper list “child’s laugh, door slam, click” borders on sensory checklist but serves pattern. No artifacts in closure beat—final line clean.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, every sentence advances image or motion. Opening line anchors voice and conceit simultaneously; final line recharges “feather / key / him” triad with crystalline compression. Only microscopic hedge—“like shattered stars” skirts cliché—but the POV’s mercury gaze justifies the sparkle. Density high yet transparent: “He tore the page free, folded it into a seed” performs three actions in nine words.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “threads whisper fragments: a pawn’s sacrifice…” collapses backstory into noun-phrase shards. No scaffold or synonym loops; metaphor stream is controlled. One mixed vessel: “fierce repose” juxtaposes oxymoron successfully, but “thunder’s lull deepened…inside him” momentarily blurs physical/acoustic logic. Final line is spare, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety is extreme yet controlled: cumulative list clauses mimic ticking clock, fragment bursts mimic structural collapse. No loops or synonym churn; each image advances either pressure or character knowledge. Figurative density peaks at the mercury-pupil reflection but is earned by prior tactile grounding. Micro-scaffold appears only once (“half-drowned...half-lit”) and is justified by the split self-theme; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: clipped beats inside cave, longer cadence at burn-painting bonfire. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new texture or knowledge. Figurative control: “shadows like broken teeth” keeps physical logic, “temporary eternity” oxymoron is earned by prior rule-teaching. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”—is evaluator language, not text artifact; text itself stays salt-and-ochre concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence-level propulsion is high: “the lighthouse’s bones, low and deliberate as a held breath” compresses atmosphere and stakes. No loops or synonym churn; “vial cork” recurs with accruing meaning, not repetition for padding. Metaphors stay coherent within maritime physics. One near-muddle—“tender, screaming only in its precision”—is saved by the surgical follow-up clause. Final line lands clean without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense, musical, avoids scaffold; sentences perform double duty—image + motive (“she built things instead—towers of driftwood…anything to chart the geography of loss”). Figurative runs are patterned and paid off (antennae as barnacles, bronze breathing). No synonym loops, no filter-verb stacks. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing”—is narrator’s metaphor, not academic drift, hence forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “He bit down. / The flavor exploded—earth and rot and something like grief—and for a heartbeat, the world softened…” advances action, atmosphere, and emotional state in ten words. No scaffold or synonym loops; metaphors stay internally coherent (chandelier orchard, pin stars). One near-purple phrase—“fruit heavy with… something older”—earns its place by thematic payoff. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm is oceanic: swell–retreat sentence pairs mirror tide. Information density high—one sentence can layer tool, body, and metaphor: “calloused from winding the Fresnel lens.” No loops or scaffold; figurative control tight—mixed metaphors 0. Metaphors are maritime-consistent (driftwood voice, tide of goodbyes). Only micro-flaw: “breath of the sea” is faint cliché; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: “creek had swollen overnight, its murmur now a low, insistent growl as it gnawed at the limestone banks” packs time, sound, danger. Rhythm modulates—long sensory sentences vs. clipped “He wasn’t here for the maps.” Metaphors organic (creek = gnawing animal). Zero paraphrase loops; one near-mixed metaphor “fingers unclenching” for roots but reads intentional. Clean proofing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is strong; sentence lengths wax and wane with the ember pulse. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Mixed-metaphor risk is flirted but controlled (“moment splitting open like a fruit, its juice the density…”) because “juice=density” is conceptually deliberate. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is an academic phrase leaking into an otherwise sensory lexicon, minor but noticeable. Closure image remains crystal, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap stops at −0.2, yielding 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere + interior + world-logic (“The scroll’s ink shimmered, not from magic but from the sheer weight of revision”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the same ink-revision conceit rather than piling miscellaneous imagery. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence detected. Occasional adjectival uplift (“feral nostalgia”) is earned by concrete consequence, not ornamental. Closure line “And here, now, he— / Soared.” uses enjambment for breathless lift without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence often does scent-memory, action, and metaphor (“fog curled…muffling clink”). No mixed metaphors; clock/gear imagery stays consistent and physically accurate. Rhythm accelerates with shorter beats during screw hand-off, then lengthens to drip-time cadence at close. Zero scaffold, loops, or register drift; “phantom limb” and “language of pressure” are exact, not purple. Final line is an iambic thud that halts the clock and the reader simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned—liquid twilight, plucked strings—taught early and paid off. One paraphrase loop (“current” metaphor over-worked across three adjacent lines) dulls momentum mid-scene. Otherwise crisp: strong verbs, zero filter stacks, pronouns clean, closing line lands on image, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies naturally: long aqueous clauses vs. staccato counts. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is spare—“pendulum swinging wide as a scythe”—and does not clog the high-pressure beat. Black water / notch imagery returns with reweighted meaning, avoiding decorative repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and almost loop-free; only “pulse/pulsed” recurrence is motif-driven, not scaffold. Metaphors are biologically coherent (mycelium as circuit) and avoided during climax to preserve clarity. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“dissolved,” “twitched”) propel. Final line cadence—“They just needed someone willing to step through”—mirrors opening invitation, earning its emphasis. One paraphrase loop (“they’re talking… like… old friends / familiar strangers”) is acceptable as lyric refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences pivot from lyric fragments to longer causal chains. No paraphrase loops; "lantern" repeats only when its state changes (lights, cracks, dies). One strained metaphor: "shelves stretched into infinity and the books whispered…numbers and wind" momentarily liquefies solid geometry, but fits dream-logic and closure. Information density high; few adverbial weeds. Clean mechanics, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. “The note was imperfect, off-key, but that was the point” compresses theme and cadence in one breath. Metaphors stay physically coherent (glass “liquid constellation” under candlelight). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “try the number again.” No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“pressed,” “spun,” “coiled”).

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences perform atmosphere, metaphor, and micro-action. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is controlled—one sustained walnut/tea/bloom motif—never clogs the final beat. Occasional elevated diction (“regenerated covenant,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by archivist’s vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density—single sentences fix radio, diagnose rheumatism, swap bread for story—without scaffold. One paraphrase-loop inside the freight car (“camphor and old paper… camphor and old paper” echo) docks −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo and closure line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances sensorial knowledge or stakes. Figurative language is patterned—sound as liquid, grief as metallurgy—taught early and paid off in the final chord. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the forest’s inhale/exhale cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene intensity—opening cadence mimics cosmic hum, final line lands in monosyllabic certainty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors (stars as crumpled paper) stay internally consistent. High information density: “dried-up fountain pen—its nib carved from a meteorite that had fallen during the Great Unspooling” world-builds in one sleek clause.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; no template stems or synonym churn. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Metaphors stay physically coherent (moon fractured into notes). Single soft filter-verb cluster “seemed to breathe” is voice-motivated and immediately grounded by tactile breeze.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    High-density lines (“tapestry’s threads, frayed but stubborn”) carry triple duty: sensory, metaphor, foreshadow. Rhythm accelerates into final short beats, breathes at “He lit a match.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent (embers ≈ question). Opening and closing images bookend without symmetry clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Metaphors are sparse, taught, and paid off: "child’s abandoned blocks" is revisited when containers *creak, settling*—same toy imagery matured into adult dread. No mixed metaphors; storm, neon, metal stay in coherent physical register. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long sensory sentence ► clipped challenge ► soft laughter dissolving—cadence breathes with stake.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each noun is specific (calloused fingers, crumpled note, cobalt dock). Figurative language is sparse, pattern-driven: “stars trapped in water” appears once and pays off in mirror transfer. Opening and closing lines perform double duty—anchor voice and re-circulate motif. No register drift; diction stays within canal-side lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors (bruise, bleeding windows) stay consistent with bodily/library fusion; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one line often does image + motive + foreshadowing. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes charged poise without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is alive: fragment (“Not in collapse, but in release—”) accelerates breath, then long participles mimic whale glide. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphor density peaks at transformation yet stays coherent: “pain was bright, clean, like the first breath after a dive” links mammalian lung memory to newborn tail. Opening and closing lines frame voice and image with zero fat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density, zero scaffold loops, rhythmic variance between breath-long fragments and spiral clauses. Only hairline slip—“something fluid and flickering” drifts toward abstraction in a peak beat, costing the final decimal. Metaphors stay coherent (ice as mirror, hymn as editable text). Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or template cadence; each sentence layers new sensory angle or causal push—“lens grew warm,” “shadows arranged themselves.” Metaphors are precise: “shattered constellation” for cracked glass, “slow bloom of a question” for bell-sound—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line “They would listen” re-casts prior material with echo-like compression.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and clipped beats that match folding/inking actions. No synonym loops; “crane” repeats with accreting meaning. Metaphors (wilted lily, curtains of intention) stay physically coherent. Information density high: single sentences fuse craft detail, memory, and emotional tilt. Minor scaffold: two near-identical “she left the first…second…third” lines could compress, but they serve cadence of ritual and do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “His fingers, stained the deep indigo of old banknotes, hovered over the Nine of Swords” fuses physical state, economic history, and suspense in one sweep. Metaphors stay internally coherent—droplets as lenses, brass tip as metronome—no mixed vehicles. Scaffolding is minimal; only one paraphrase loop (“the work was never about… it was about…”) but it serves as incantatory cadence, not slop. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp, the final laugh punching air outward without expositional tail.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies from elongated lyric cadences to fragmentary beats under pressure; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—“dissolving into atoms of nostalgia” returns in closure—though a few adjectival stacks (“rusted-amber twilight”) flirt with over-density.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences perform double duty: “Its shelves heavy with books that bloomed with light when touched” fuses setting, magic rule, and emotional charge in one line. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphors are coherent—stone as “breath held too long,” shadow as “sleeping cat”—and never mixed. Minor scaffold: “the library held its breath” appears twice, but the repetition is purposeful, creating a heartbeat pattern that culminates in the final sigh. Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence dulls the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the salve strokes; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are few but precise—“pearl of new growth glistens, translucent as dawn on spider silk”—and avoid purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances healing or self-reckoning. One register slip—“conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not Elias’s—costs a hairline −0.1. Otherwise clean, propulsive, read-aloud ready.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information-dense lines do triple duty: “Displaced miracles—that’s what scars were” compresses concept, theme, and character insight. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to fragment—“Of course it didn’t.”—mirroring the halted hourglass. One mixed-metor slip: “stone skin still damp from the night’s slow weeping” drifts toward personification overload, but recovers immediately. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; final paragraph is propulsive despite quiet content.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “celluloid warming as if alive” does setting, character, and metaphor in one clause. No synonym loops; “reel,” “strip,” “film” appear only when physical state shifts. Metaphors stay coherent—light as hunger, silence as spool end. One hairline slip: “incubate the truth” edges toward therapeutic diction but is saved by immediate bodily context (breath fogging glass). Final line breathes; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined: “stone veined with silver like the scars of a god’s forgotten battle” is allowed because it pays off in the archway’s dissolution. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors in peak beats; read-aloud rhythm modulates with breath.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, stakes, and metaphor. Occasional stacked qualifiers (“skeletal ribbon of steel cutting through the glowing dunes in bloom”) flirt with overwriting but serve cadence, never obscure causality. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with white-space staccato of single-line stanzas.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; no scaffold. Information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, metaphor, and micro-action (“the gear turned against his skin, not by his will, but by the pull of the hum”). Metaphors stay coherent—mechanical flora remain physically legible. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo—“hums” becomes heartbeat. Line-level craft propels the accumulative cadence without conspicuous artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with tide-onset cadence; no loops or filler. Occasional poetic lift (“the water lapped…like a gently persistent question”) stops just short of overwriting and serves the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies via enjambed clauses and selective fragments: “Snow slid…revealing the cobalt beneath—not blue, not really, but the color of a bruise just before it fades.” Information density high; single sentences layer sensory, symbolic, and causal data. Metaphors organic (note thrumming in molars, silence as unpardonable) without overcrowding. Minor scaffold: “quiet that wasn’t absence but a held breath” recycles idea twice; does not obscure climax. No loops or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned—ink as wound, crown as mask—but taught early and paid off in the cracked scepter, avoiding purple overload. No loops or synonym churn; “dust and old promises” is the only conceptual echo, intentional. Final paragraph cadence breathes exactly where the moral weight lands.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is loop-free; no paraphrase or template cadence obscures meaning. Figurative density spikes only at two hinge images—“metronome counting down something no one could name” and “ink running like tears”—both earned and pattern-justified. Sentences do double work: “The station hummed…clink-clank” sets atmosphere while foreshadowing rhythm method. The only micro-slip is “as if listening,” a faint filter verb, but it passes under character-based license.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; most sentences do two jobs (atmosphere + action). One paraphrase loop: “the rebellion had stalled… forgotten how to listen” echoes thrice; mild scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (rust flakes as fallout, hum as second heartbeat). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Final third clean; artifacts do not touch closure. Ear-test varies cadence; paragraph cuts purposeful. Solid 8, not immaculate 9.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances root-pressure or image. Mixed metaphors disciplined: “roots breaking stone” aligns with volcanic spring cracking amber. High density: “steam curled… testing the future” sets stakes, senses, metaphor in 12 words. Final line breathes, no drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is scaffold-free; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“ghost of foghorns,” “pearl of stillness”—each taught early and paid off in closure cadence. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on micro-turns (photo release, leaf pocketing). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes with sensory specificity, no boilerplate.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often paints, smells, and philosophizes without scaffold. Two adjacent metaphors (“tower leaning in… shelves pressing closer”) share the same compression vector—acceptable because the pattern (architecture-as-body) is taught early and paid off at closure. No loops or synonym churn; opening line anchors voice and stakes. Final line offers resonant cadence without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density—one sentence often triples as image, world-rule, and emotional cue (“the liquid bled... dissolving before it could settle, revealing glimpses”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the fracture motif. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths create visual staccato that mirrors time snaps. Only micro-slippage: “like honey” and “syrupy” in same sentence is mild redundancy, but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so high band holds.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: frost-laced spine, burnt-copper ink, ozone scent—each noun doing double duty. Rhythm accelerates into staccato bullets without scaffold. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay consistent (snow/shroud, light/blade). Minor filter-verb cluster (“should have hurt. Instead, it felt”) forgiven in collapse beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; no template runs. Figurative density high but patterned (“tower… sandcastle under a boot”) and pays off at closure. One scaffold spot: “they stretched toward the light, unaware… that was the point” veers toward exposition, but momentum recovers. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information dense: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, symbolic work.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“sleepwalking constellations” returns as healed wound), so density never stalls momentum. Information dual-loads: “rail spike…still warm from the forge” reveals recent craft and paternal urgency. One mixed metaphor risk—“stars snapped like a healed wound”—but physical logic holds within the fantasy frame and lands cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances ledger, atmosphere, or stake. Metaphors are coherent (orbit, steam-comet) and physically rooted. Minor scaffold: “the way…” anaphora twice in paragraph 2; paraphrase loop on “proof by contradiction” explanation. Does not touch closure; stays above artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like the lab itself—long sentences for drone, fragments for cracks. Information density is high: “map of the Pleiades, each star a scar” fuses astronomy, profession, and guilt in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the sound-debt conceit without contradiction. The only micro-slip is “perfectly preserved” echoing “perfectly preserved” four lines later, but the repetition is thematic, not artifactual.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: one-word paragraph “Again?” snaps like chalk line; previous flowing sentences mirror mandala spirals. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; every sentence either advances image or stakes. Figurative layer is dense (almost every sentence metaphoric) but pattern-taught early (“mist coiled like a held breath”) and paid off at close, so density reads as design, not clutter. Minor hedge: “the kind of silence that wasn’t absence, but presence” is abstract; tightening to sensory pulse would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: single sentences do triple duty (setting, synesthesia, backstory). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and justified. Minor overwrite in “sound that wasn’t sound but the color of dusk” slightly strains logic, but it clears before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    Rhythm breathes with beats: long sensory sentences early, fragment bursts at climax. High information density—each sentence advances image or causality; zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent within light-logic (“brushstroke of longing”); no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “remembered” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density high—single sentence often does setting + emotion + tech cue (“wrist display dissolved into static, then reformed: a topographic map of grief”). Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” zone but fits mapper mindset. Read-aloud rhythm propels to final rain line.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose carries high density—each sentence layers image, stake, and sensory filter without scaffolding. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “the canyon held its breath” is singular and paid off when the hourglass exhales backward. No loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts are lean. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he believed, quietly inspired…”) is earned by reflective context and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrases (“conceptual cost,” “conceptual repricing”) appear in the rubric, not the story, so ignored. One mixed metaphor cluster around “ledger” and “vouchsafe” slightly thickens the climax, keeping it shy of 9-band purity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“fog curled like a held breath”) and paid off when breath is finally exhaled in crossing. High density—each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Minor tick: “spindrift serenity” risks prettiness but is saved by its appearance in the dissolving exit, not as decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies from lyrical sweep to urgent beat—“He pressed it to the bowl’s wet surface” propels without scaffold. Metaphors are selective: “dying star,” “old wounds” appear once each and payoff in kiln light. No synonym loops; “thrum” repeats intentionally as motif. Occasional elevated phrasing—“time thinning,” “conceptual repricing” diction—mild register drift but does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet limpid—each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are avoided; "bones groaning like old ship timber" is single, apt. One paraphrase loop ("the hum swelled, the shelves groaned") is minor. No filter-verb stacks or scaffolding in the closure third; high-band slips are hairline only.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive: sentence variety, no template cadence, zero paraphrase loops. Figurative layer is dense but pattern-taught early (“petal-like domes,” “ghost of the thing”) and paid off in the dissolving orb image; no mixed metaphors at closure. One tiny scaffold—“the thread was there. It had always been there”—is justified as mantra-like recurrence. High information density: damp boots, ink bleed, thrush song all advance theme or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable—each sentence advances stakes or sensation (“headphones warm against her ears” couples body and tool). No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; “cosmic static” stays within her lexicon. One near-scaffold: “charts…smudged where her sleeves had brushed them” repeats fabric-contact twice in three lines, but the second adds causal star-shift, so forgiven. Peak beats stay lucid amid figurative load.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphor chains (“roots writhed slow as sleeping serpents”) serve atmosphere without clogging. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. One mixed vehicle: “petals of rock” alongside “breathing stone” is borderline but saved by sustained organic motif. Final cigarette beat is crisp, closing rhythm on inhalation/exhalation parallel to city’s new breath.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or memory. Figurative layer is dense yet coherent—metal hums, mist coils, quarry remembers—without spillage into mixed metaphor. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by forward motion that recharges the ribbon. One near-repeat: “the quarry wasn’t empty / the quarry kept its secrets” is acceptable echoic closure, not redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between short, wind-gusted fragments and longer, silt-heavy clauses. Information density is high—each sentence either advances storm, reveals ancestry, or charges the nail. Zero mixed metaphors; brass goggles fogging is concrete, not decorative. Only nit: “like a tuning fork struck against the wrong frequency” is slightly overwritten, but it occurs pre-peak and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, metaphor, and world-rule. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (twilight-shard, river-stutter). One register drift—“pixel by pixel”—is justified by concept. Final line crisp, propulsive. Read-aloud rhythm varied.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and grounded (“rusted into the earth like a forgotten promise”). One mixed-metaphor risk—“glass skeletons glinting like the ribs of something starved”—barely skirts strain. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary; no scaffold loops. Occasional purple tinge—“lattice of light,” “thread that spooled”—but imagery stays legible and thematically tied. One mixed metaphor: stars dim “in relief” (personification borderline). High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (action, image, theme). No typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence variety: long spiral sentences mimic swirl, then snapped fragments (“He didn’t flinch.”) create stasis beats. No loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image—e.g., “petals peeling back to reveal rows of needle-teeth” fuses visual and threat in one stroke. Metaphors are coherent: lake as wound, silence as hunger, key as transferable guilt—no mixed vehicles. Peak beat (lake scream) is unadorned, avoiding purple overlay. Copy-clean: pronouns track through crowd of “it,” “he,” “lake,” “plant” without ambiguity.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar folkloric ingredients—cursed lake, druid, warlock—are reforged into a confession engine where the horror is complicity, not death. The seed-as-oral-transmission device is fresh: truth is literally devoured and excreted as warm metal. Risk-taking in second-person parenthetical asides (“He pretended not to hear”) implicates reader without breaking POV. Synthesis feels inevitable: only this lake could keep choices, only this man could carry them away. No close echoes; the brother-jump reframes “drowning” folklore into suicide-consent myth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: the iterative “She…then she…” in the maze run is a taught pattern that syncs footfall and scar pulse, not template cadence. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in 800 words—each charging stakes (yew key, nautilus spiral, crescent eyes). No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Opening and closing lines book-end with cobalt/scent anchors, achieving propulsive circularity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional metaphor density (“roots twisting like veins through the ribs of the forgotten”) risks excess but stays legible. One scaffold spot: “She had come here, as always, to patch…” could compress. Info density high—“roots coiled around her wrist, not to trap, but to weave” advances plot, image, and cost in one line. Closure line clean: “The future was in the walking.”

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs. Mixed metaphors avoided—“dust motes like lighters” sustains single vehicle. High density: one line can set, characterize, and echo theme (“trailer smelled like old coffee and damp cardboard”). Minor paraphrase loop on “uncertainty didn’t feel like failure” / “felt like the space between notes” but spaced enough to pass. Clean grammar, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “roots tangled in the storm-wracked heavens” does triple sensory-physics-worldbuilding work. No mixed metaphors; magnetic bloom obeys its own logic. Minor scaffolding: “like the fingers of a god” is a lone stock simile, but it occurs early and does not recur. Final paragraph achieves crystalline closure without overwriting; the blank tablet image recharges earlier tablets with zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor (liquid opals, silverfish migration) performs double duty—image + concept. No loops, but slight scaffold in “This was how wonder survived routine” tells what the scene already shows. Mixed-metaphor risk in ‘fractaling dawn’/‘liquid opals’ is paid off by prismatic logic. Final line ‘held breath’ repeats earlier breath image, yet the reprise reweights the stake, earning the echo.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates into breathless embroidery as light spills; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse until the final unfolding, preventing purple drift. One mixed metaphor—“light stitched… like embroidery”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “sunlight filtering through in jagged patches” mirrors internal fracture. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) is narrator-appropriate, not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (“mist swallowed path,” “ink bloomed beneath her skin”) are precise, never mixed. Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs—anchors time, bodies object, charges theme. Opening and closing lines pass the read-aloud ear test with contrasting cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“cipher,” “propagation delay”) is justified by library-as-concept; no register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths breathe with tension. High density: “ice exploded into a thousand prismatic needles” does three jobs—sound, sight, stakes. One mixed metaphor cluster (“spectrum of grief and something sharper: defiance”) barely muddies peak. No loops, no filler; pronouns clean.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers metaphor, body, and plot advance—“She pressed the chip to her temple, and the grotto’s walls shivered” moves object, setting reaction, and causal trigger in nine words. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (aurora as exhale, static as language) rather than repeating. One mixed metaphor—“echo of a choice never made”—is minor and does not cloud closure. Final-line spareness caps the lyric swell at exactly the right moment.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses yield to staccato action. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned early (scallop motif) and paid off. Closure line is clean, image-driven, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and variegated: “he’d woven from borrowed doubts, each thread a confession he’d swallowed whole” does triple work (backstory, metaphor, motive). Occasional micro-loop—“the shard wasn’t for seeing. It was for listening”—reads as purposeful parallelism rather than churn. No mixed metaphors; sea and light imagery cohere. Final third avoids artifacts; dust-on-lens image is pristine. One paraphrase-loop near midpoint (−0.2) keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet lean: information-rich lines (“lodestone that pulsed in time with the starlight”) do double duty. Occasional poetic abstractions (“a syllable of wind”) are earned by voice; no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Could trim a few adjectives (“prismatic threads”) without loss, but artifacts never touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is near-loop-free; only microscopic echo is “the skimmer” repetition, but it serves mantra effect. Metaphors are coherent: “echoes curled,” “storm of erratic vibrations.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with wind cadence. One sentence—“He had done what his ancestors could not”—is summary, but it compresses rather than stalls. Closure line “the canyon breathed” is crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm modulates: long, icy sentences climb; punchy fragments at summit (“Mist walking. Of course.”). Metaphors are lean and concrete (“hollow as a polished stone”). One paraphrase loop (“the sacred isn’t in the spectacle… in the stub of wax…”) is purposeful echo, not artifact. No mixed metaphors; closure image stays sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero scaffold, no paraphrase loops, high density (“pages fused into brittle sculptures of lost knowledge”). Figurative layering is taught early and paid off—the metronome lantern becomes the pendulum that marks the color shift. One mixed-metor candidate: “light pooling over the ship’s broken spine” (liquid on bone) but the physical logic holds under lyric license. Final image is unmarred by artifice, allowing 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and high-density; figurative language is selective (“static bursts… like distant Morse”) and never clutters the peak beat. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The single nit is the echo of “had always been” in adjacent sentences, a hairline slip that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances either fear-crystal growth or setting decay. Metaphors are disciplined—ink “unspooling like threads of shadow” keeps physical logic. One paraphrase loop appears: “The echoes were silent now. / But the fears had names. / And names were the first step toward sacrifice” — consecutive declaratives that restate rather than deepen; a −0.2 ding. Otherwise density is high: wax dust, salt, ink, and bone each carry multiple symbolic and practical loads without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“spine of frozen lightning,” “bronze throat split by time and salt”—each image advances stakes or object state. No mixed metaphors; scaffolding trimmed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image (“the viaduct sang back”) that recharges earlier drip motif.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and precise—no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence can anchor place, reveal backstory, and tilt present choice. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on ember or water beats that recharge the mirror motif.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and musical—“fire licked at the crystal, and the ice within began to sing”—without metaphor muddle. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“glass bells ringing backward through time”—reads purposeful, not clarity-breaking. Opening and final lines act as frame anchors; paragraph cuts are tight. Minor over-adjectival drift (“kaleidoscopic fury”) is forgivable under lyric mode; does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—arbor as ship, canopy as held breath—without mixed-vehicle crash. High density: *“branches heavy with dew that never fell”* does world-rule, mood, and foreshadow in nine words. Only hairline slip: *“skeletal glow”* edges toward stock, but saved by specificity of curfew-emptied streets.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety is deliberate—long atmospheric openers collapse into fragment beats (“Pain lanced—*his* skull…”) to mimic syncope. Metaphors are few but precise: Schism wound “like tearing silk” is tactile, not ornamental. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct (“He pressed his palm to the glass”). One paraphrase loop: “since the war ended… since the monks… since the two halves…” accumulates without new pressure, a minor drag that keeps it from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentence length modulates from languid to staccato at seed split. Figurative language selective—“stink of death and miracles” lands once, earns keep. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Minor overwrite: “orthogonal thinking” and “conceptual repricing” feel imported academic diction amid otherwise tactile voice, nudging down from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. High density: “macerated the silence first, shredding it with controlled bursts” shows verb-driven propulsion. One paraphrase loop—“laughter… laughter all the same”—is brief enough to avoid artifact penalty. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays within acoustic/wind register.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with participle or noun swaps without algorithmic pattern. High density: “frost-etched spine of a book she’d salvaged...” collapses backstory + object + action. Minor scaffold: “She waited. / Waiting was what she did best.” – adjacent restatement, one −0.2. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (mist as skin, ground as page) stay coherent. No artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence at least dual job. Metaphors stay internally coherent—frozen bloom, serpent hunger—without purple drift. High information density: “ember nexus hummed…veins of molten copper pulsing like a dying heart” sets scene, stakes, and metaphor in nineteen words. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, high density: “the dish groaned…silence—not absence, but a presence” packs causality and metaphor without muddle; final line’s “spat it back as light” lands sonic closure with imagistic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates: long languid clauses in calm, staccato quotes under deadline. Figurative language kept to ~30% and always purposeful—“constellations rewriting themselves” teaches pattern logic. No mixed metaphors; “vacuum hungry for loose threads” tracks physically. Minor filter verbs (“she knew”) accepted as interior seam; no loops or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence frequently delivers scent + metaphysics + backstory cue. Rhythm breathes with escalating fragments as gallery inhales. Mixed-metaphor risk (“filament spun from memories—realistically imaginary, pliable as thought but sharp as glass”) is deliberate POV credo, not accident, so allowed. Paraphrase loops absent; no scaffold. Line propulsion clean; every sentence advances pattern or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: every sentence advances map, character, or atmosphere—no scaffold. Metaphors are internally coherent (anchor = key, horizon = spiral) and physically grounded. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new tactile or visual information. Ear-test rhythms vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Only hairline slip: “somber marvel” is used twice; the second could be pruned. Closure line is crisp and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence often performs atmosphere, characterization, and plot advancement. No synonym loops or template cadences detected. Metaphors stay coherent (mist as pressure, photograph as memory contract). Strong verbs replace modifiers—“the mist curled,” “static hissed.” Final paragraph varies rhythm to create cadence of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: “crashing hush,” “skeletal remains of experiments too quiet to leave records.” Metaphors are internally coherent—serpents, living earth, held breath—and never stack into purple. One paraphrase loop: “He would return. / He always did.” is rhythmically deliberate, not scaffolding. No filter-verb clog; sentences drive forward with strong verbs—“squeezed,” “traced,” “closed”—keeping momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long inhalations to staccato shards (“The diamond cracked. The flock scattered.”) without algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—wind carries “voices no living throat had shaped” remains physically believable in this world. No synonym loops; each metaphor advances stakes. One near-mixed metaphor: “copper…turned to ice” is allowable under surreal license and does not fog causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; metaphor density is high yet purposeful, pattern-taught. A few near-paraphrase clusters (“the joke” repeated in close succession) slightly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or impossible physics. Opening and final lines are image-driven and ear-tested. Overall propulsion survives the lyric load, but trimming 2–3 adjectives would sharpen peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences layer wind-howling, petal-brass, statue-hum. No paraphrase loops; each image adds new mechanical/living tension. Metaphors stay coherent (gears as dead skin, statues as soil). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“future was already blooming”). Minor rhythm echo in “she played… she played” could vary syntax, but propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density: single sentences couple external move with interior charge (“He ran, the storm warm against his ribs”). Occasional lyrical stacking (“thunderstorm in a bottle...slow peel of thunder”) is patterned early, so forgiven. One paraphrase loop: “Some borders...some promises...” but it lands the closure cadence. Clean grammar; spatial sequence clear.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary rhythm; opening spondee “abandoned circus train” sets dirge tempo, final line “Then he began” cuts to trochee release. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances image or choice. Figurative density peaks only in oasis car where mirrors demand it. Filter verbs minimal; “he felt” appears once and motivates touch.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “threads unspooling like roots seeking water” fuses tactile and botanical in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay internally consistent—light as liquid, library as mouth. A single mixed metaphor (“satellites orbiting a forgotten planet”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one line often triple-loads (mushroom = detector, trade token, closure sacrifice). Metaphor chain (stars/threads/stitches) stays coherent; no mixed vehicles. Scaffolding minimal—one paraphrase loop (“weight of a life’s worth of moments”) but does not recur in peak beat. Read-aloud rhythm varies: long aqueous sentences vs. staccato revelations. Closing line lands on monosyllabic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long sensual clauses to staccato commands (“Annotate this”), propelling beats. Figurative density is high but patterned—light bends “when it’s tired” teaches the speculative tone early and pays off at the pane. No mixed metaphors; metaphor vehicles obey physical logic. One minor scaffolding loop: “the kind of quiet that...” could be trimmed, but it does not recur near closure. Diction stays within Elspeth’s antique-archivist lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates into the veil-crossing, then breathes at the sapling reveal. Information density high—“its colors too vivid for mortal eyes” does triple duty: world-rule, stake, foreshadow fade. Minor register lift in “iridescent shine” is justified by POV’s painterly hunger.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density, varied rhythm, and minimal scaffold; figurative language is selective (“sugar in tea”), but the phrase “cost of light” recycles four times and the final “the sea, finally, was quiet” edges toward poetic overstatement, keeping this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative density spikes only at the climax (“chorus of screams wrapped in lullaby”) yet remains coherent under pattern already taught. Information density is high: one sentence can do setting-work *and* foreshadow closure (“ghost *in code*”). Final line’s monosyllabic thump (“no echo at all”) gives cadence-release without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors are coherent: brass cables “singing” sustains the audio motif without mixed vehicle clash. Information density high—e.g., “servant ascending by default” compresses class, crash, and promotion in five words. Final line cadence mirrors the climb: short declaratives = summit breath.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; no template cadence. Figurative layering is dense yet each metaphor (clouds as held breath, thread of light as seam) returns to tactile stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; each image adds pressure or memory. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in telescope inscription, justified as paternal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is spare and precise—“like trying to catch smoke in a net”—never clustering into purple haze. Information density is high: one sentence slips the guild joke, the memory of failures, the metaphor of smoke. Opening line anchors voice and paradox; final line resolves by image that recharges the smoke-and-net motif into sky-ink.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence performs two jobs—e.g., “Her breath curled like old ink” delivers sensory detail and foreshadows the library’s manuscript decay. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is singular and discarded. Register holds: diction stays within a craftswoman’s lexicon—“teeth filed into crescent moon,” “jaws bent from prying.” Minor alliteration (“bright brutal and new”) is earned by the cathartic beat and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional stacked similes (“wings… shattered moons”) risk purple tint yet stay within lyric contract taught by opening “ribs of a god.” Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths vary, final single-sentence paragraph lands as punch. No scaffolding, no filter-verb clutter; each image advances atmosphere or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, action, or atmosphere. Mixed metaphors are deliberate and coherent—“beam a slow wound,” “salt-spit of waves” read as perceptual distortion under Elias’s warped senses. High information density: “compressed like sap in amber” does double duty as tactile image and thematic compression. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the scene—no template cadence, no filler qualifiers, no scaffold clauses. The final line lands on monosyllabic bluntness after lyrical surge, earning its hush.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“silver fingers creeping” echoes frost without mixed metaphors. High information density: one sentence can convey time, temperature, and emotional shift. Rhythm breathes with the frost-clock, accelerating toward the final pressed nut.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one line can paint grief, material science, and motion (“papery walls brittle as the last letter”). Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “composer writing in haste” is sustained through “missed note,” “sheet music,” “sustained note.” One minor scaffold: “He’d spent years...” paragraph opens with near-repeat of earlier “decade” summary, but propels to new insight. No artifacts in the closing beat; final sentence is clean, rhythmic, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; figurative language appears sparingly and purposefully. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; sentences vary in length and opening. “The lull of opening day stretched around her, thick with possibility” does double duty—atmosphere + interior state—without overwriting. Clean grammar and precise punctuation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors gustatory intake—long, mouth-filling clauses early, short palate-cleansers at exit. No loops; each image ingests then yields place. Figurative density is high but patterned (taste→temperature→texture) and pays off in final tastelessness. One near-miss: “sandstone walls glistening under a moon that hung too low” edges purple yet survives as POV-true.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long breathless climbs to short orchestral cutoff (“Not harmony yet.”). Information density is high: one sentence often delivers time, sensory cue, and social history (“beneath the hush of borrowed starlight, she climbed…”). No mixed metaphor; brass weight = balance + voice, a single coherent vehicle. Minor paraphrase loop—“elevator’s rhythms steady… elevator’s final rehearsal… elevator’s belly”—is purposeful motif-repetition, not scaffold, so no deduction. Final line lands with snap, recharging “singing in the same key” without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information-to-word ratio: one sentence can layer nanotech, memory theory, and body horror without pausing. Metaphors are mixed (“canyon… fractured ribs… silver scalpel”) but reinforce anatomical/trauma through-line, so they cohere rather than clash. One scaffold loop: “chaotically precise” appears twice in close succession; otherwise rhythm varies and no filter-verb stacks dull the beats.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Information density is high—“the page drank the light” does three jobs in five words. Figurative language is selective and patterned; only one mixed metaphor risk (“air ripped like a held note”) but it remains legible. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; momentum breathes with the beats. Proofing clean; no typos or homophones.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences (dawn light) to staccato fragments under sonic stress. Information density high: one sentence can place body, tool, acoustic finding, and memory. No loops or scaffold; “cracks” recurs with reweighted meaning, not repetition. Metaphors stay physical and consistent—no mixed vehicles. Minor hairline: “empathy in motion” is the closest to label-speak but saved by immediate embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often jobs—setting, metaphor, interior (“nexus hummed… like held breath… paths of knights”). No loops or synonym churn; figurative layers stay coherent (magnetic=chess=breath). Varied sentence rhythm mirrors pulse of field. Final line “game that had remembered how to breathe” lands clean without overwrite, recharging every prior gap.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “He needed to recover its meaning before the fireworks drowned everything out” fuses motive, clock, and stakes in one line. No synonym loops; each metaphor is single-use and physically coherent (embers, breath, gunshot). One mixed metaphor risk—“sky still holding its breath”—is saved by payoff when fireworks literally force exhalation. Filter verbs avoided; sensory hierarchy obeys urgency. Final line “the sound of careful hands” is texturally specific, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often delivers scent, emotional state, and world rule (“scent coiled like smoke, then paused as the village’s central bell tolled”). No filter-verb clusters; metaphors stay physical and consistent. Single loop spotted—“sway” repeated three times in closing paragraph—but is purposeful repricing, not artifact. Closure image is uncluttered, propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long aerial glide sentences brake into staccato landing beats. Mixed metaphors avoided—“veins weeping sap,” “mouth lined with moss”—keep physical logic consistent. One paraphrase loop: “the moss didn’t just glow—it accelerated growth” could trim, but occurs pre-closure so −0.1. Information density high; every line advances flight, world rule, or stakes. Closure sentence “She was ready to scream back” propels without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density—“wind didn’t gust—it *pulsed*” packs physics + menace. No synonym loops; single metaphor string (“tuning fork”) is purposeful and paid off. Final third free of artifact; earlier prose clean.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: “ribbons of violet and gold” returns as “bridges of light.” Information density high—single sentences collapse time (“the sculptor’s chisel had struck marble at the birth of time”) without clutter. Read-aloud ear test passes; cadence modulates from murmur to anthem. Only micro-slip: “synesthetically blessed” is clinical amid sensory richness.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm mirrors breath and wind; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Metaphors are spare—“rotting thread,” “stone dropped into deep water”—each precise and non-contradictory. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and causal freight. Zero scaffold or loop; no paraphrase churn. Opening and final lines are ear-tested for propulsion and echo.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level density high—most sentences do two jobs (advance + texture). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare, patterned, paid off (“halo broken and whole all at once”). Rhythm varies with scene tempo; short beats during needle-drop climax. Only micro-slip: “lucid turbulence” approaches label-speak, but context earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from short tremor lines to long breath of abyss. Information density high: one line often does setting, metaphor, and interior shift (“the ridgeway’s glow seeped into his bones”). Figurative choices stay coherent—dragonfly, vibration, hum—no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold; grammar clean. Final image (“the hum was home”) is monosyllabic payoff that reframes earlier lyric fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “crystalline branches refracting the dawn into fractured rainbows that bled into the mist” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent (light → bones → debt). One near-miss: “needle-thin beams” edges toward purple, but the prior soundlessness justifies the image. Final paragraph breathes, giving cadence release.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear is excellent: cadence mirrors loom motion, with periodic short beats to mimic thread tension. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new sensory or conceptual layer. Figurative language is disciplined—only two metaphors per crisis beat, both internally coherent. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase is voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear: varied sentence openings, no template cadence; high density—every sentence advances image, pressure, or sound. Figurative language spare (only “shimmering like cracked ice,” “threads…like cracked ice”) and justified by POV’s metalworker eye. No paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Single passive—“the metal didn’t fight him”—is intentional, voice-motivated. Copy-clean; no typos or pronoun drift. Closure beat is unmarred by lyric overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences do world-building, interiority, and propulsion (“She pocketed the shard. The weight of it was wrong—not in grams, but in meaning.”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the final step without sacrificing clarity. Opening and closing lines both anchor and recharge.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence delivers time-jump, geography, character state. Metaphors are spare, coherent, grounded in keeper world (glass as breath, stones as ladder). No filler, no loops, no scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with scene temperature—short pulse for ascent, lengthened hum for settling stones. Clause order stays clear; no simultaneity errors. Micro-clip for overworking “held breath/breath-held” twice; otherwise exemplary line control.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stake or texture. Metaphors are internally consistent—flame as drowning man, dawn as commodity, laughter as weapon—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for spiral ascent, staccato fragments for the ignition of prophecy. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves with sonic callback—“the storm was coming. And so was she”—delivering cadence closure. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no corporate register drift; even technical “total internal reflection” is motivated by her optic craft.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is dense and musical: “brass arms bent like a dying spider” packs visual, tactile, mortal weight in six words. No scaffold loops; each sentence either advances image or stakes. One mixed-metor risk—“moonlight pooled like liquid silver” beside “storm rattling shutters like an impatient god”—but physical logic holds because both occur at different temporal beats. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp, framing and recharging the star motif.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; each sentence layers new texture or causal push. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: “root-breath” returns as literal exhalation that fogs glass; trapped sunrise becomes live dawn. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay inside arboreal/alchemical logic. Information density high—one line can set, characterize, and foreshadow (“silver leaf quivered, then split open, revealing a vein of gold”). Final third clean: no artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; paragraph cuts are surgical. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“phantom limbs,” “nest inside the egg”—never clotted. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Opening and closing lines anchor and release with image-driven propulsion. One hairline slip: “quiet hum of the city” is faintly generic, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences layer time-settling frost, vanished bakery, and character gift. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent—steam/memory spool, wheat/fountain swap—no mixed logic. Rhythm accelerates across paragraph breaks mirroring bread diffusion; final sentence slows into cadence of enoughness. One paraphrase echo: “for the first time in years” repeated, but functions as accumulative refrain rather than scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “shelves carved from ice and its books bound in frostbitten leather” does three jobs—visual, tactile, and stakes. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay within light/sound spectrum. Minor scaffold: “the air smelled of ozone and old paper” echoes earlier “ozone and old paper” but the second hit deepens tone rather than loops. No artifact touches the closing line.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—“ledger of fake debts, a map to a cache that didn’t exist” compresses weeks of prep into one clause. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Final line anchors closure image without overwriting: “smoke curling into the pale morning like a question no one needed to answer.”

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("crystal cave’s jagged walls…drip of mineral water…rasp of charcoal") without overwriting. Metaphors are coherent—"colors like veins pulled from stone"—and do not collide. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Final line ("the sound of a seal breaking") is crisp, auditory, and recharges the lock image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence either advances plot, deepens texture, or performs both. Figurative language is selective and coherent: “letters…curling like dying petals” sustains the botanical dome metaphor without mixed-vehicle spillover. Information density is high—one line slips chronotope, sensory data, and emotional valence (“the air smelled of damp earth and something older—like the first breath after a long-held scream”). No filter-verb stacks; verbs stay strong (“squeezed,” “plucked,” “pressed”). Closure beat is clean of artifice: plate smooth, ink dry, breath lighter—three monosyllables that end on an unstressed syllable to mimic exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—sensorial texture + forward motion—with only two paraphrase loops (“the ice glistened…”) that do not recur in the closure beat. Metaphors stay coherent under physical logic; no mixed vehicles. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to lean, seemed to hear”) is voice-motivated and brief. A single scaffold phrase “This was her work” could be cut, but artifacts never touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty: “mailbox creaked. / Not from the wind.” Micro-beat propulsion. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“light like a slow exhale”), paid off in final “soft air.” No loops, no filter-verb stacks; information density high. One mixed metaphor—“thread pulling them closer”—minor, doesn’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; every sentence advances image, pressure, or sound. Metaphors are coherent: spider-web current → patient, inevitable; breath-fog on glass → mortal immediacy. Information density high: “bare feet found the cold floor’s rhythm” = body + temperature + musical code in one stroke. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs throughout (“pressed,” “traced,” “clattered,” “dissolved”). Final line cadence mirrors wave rhythm, recharging motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence propulsion is high: “The stone was the key”→paragraph break→immediate chamber entry. No filler, no loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal data. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“gravity pooled like ink in water”). Final paragraph cadence slows to match exhausted acceptance—three short sentences echo tide breaths. One near-loop: “the lanterns burned on” repeats the opener’s phrasing, but it is intentional resonance, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is cadence-controlled: paragraph lengths visually mimic breathing; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors; “lattice of light” and “serpent of soundless syllables” extend origami logic without muddle. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym churn. High density: every sentence layers image, stakes, and sensory shift. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: “wisteria vines curled like question marks” does double duty for setting and theme. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Occasional elevated note (“conceptual repricing”) is contained within Veyra’s dialogue, justified by his arch persona, so minimal register drift. Read-aloud rhythm peaks with the meteor shower single-line paragraphs, then settles into the quiet hand-off.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for digging, staccato “She did.” at turning point. High density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, world rule (“petals…as if burned by something brighter than fire”). Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines mirror with reweighted diction (“breathed” vs “remembered back”).

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; every sentence advances Stakes or Atmosphere. Figurative language is patterned (ink=frost=regret) and pays off at closure. No filter-verb clusters or template cadence. One near-loop: "the ink—his ink, the ink of a thousand lies" could lose middle clause, but it occurs early and doesn’t touch the climax, so deduction stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned (echo, thread, song) and never muddies causality. Opening and closing lines book-end with sonic void, creating cadence frame. No loops, no synonym churn, no register drift; even elevated diction feels native to a singer who thinks in resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose shows high density: one sentence fuses metaphor, backstory, and causality—“its hull splitting like a wishbone against the berg.” No loops or synonym churn; each sensory return (salt, diesel, ice) adds new informational layer. One mixed metaphor risk—“light pouring like tide”—but justified by coastal setting and paid off in closure. Minor scaffold: repetitive “Lena pressed” in adjoining clauses, but rhythm supports ritual motion rather than dullness.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: spondaic “whispering parapet” then hushed sibilance in “last drops of rain slid.” Information density is high—one sentence nets, seasons, gender labor. No scaffold; each line advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent: bamboo legs ≠ spider contradiction; both are jointed, startled. Only microscopic loop: “the pattern you didn’t know you were making” echoes prior “pattern” 2×; barely audible.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or synonym churn; metaphor vehicles (“broken mirror,” “eye of the storm”) stay internally coherent. Rhythm accelerates into breathless final paragraph without drumbeat monotony. Minor over-density in three adjacent figurative phrases mid-story (−0.2) but never near closure; final line earns its silence after heartbeat-hum.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, causal, metaphoric without clog. No paraphrase loops; “cobalt” recurs only when its meaning mutates. Figurative language is controlled—three metaphors across climax, each distinct. One mixed moment—“storm became a crown”—is earned by prior storm-personification. Proofing clean; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image or pressure. High density: “sand had crept… dusting his threadbare coat and the pages” does triple scene-setting work. Figurative language is spare and accurate—dunes as “restless giants,” breath curling “in the chill of dawn’s earliest whistle.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the box’s halting cadence; no artifact intrudes on closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are integrated—“unyoking of weight from burden”—and do not collide. One scaffold risk: “the real work had never been in the breaking / it had been in the waiting” is a near-paraphrase loop, but the beat serves as thematic hinge and escapes penalty by tightening stakes. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: single sentences perform triple duty (“The walls here were lined with tiles…their glazing worn thin by time and neglect” sets era, texture, and metaphor). No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or stance. Metaphors stay physically coherent—water as thirst, bricks as wrung rag. A single mixed image (“constellation of forgotten stars”) is earned by its placement at the crystallizing final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops, no synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“gears whispering like a confession”—and never multiplies into clutter. Opening line anchors both voice and stakes instantly; final line resolves by action, not commentary. High density: “He sealed the envelope. Then he picked up the music box...” carries plot, weather, and moral motion in two beats.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does image + causality (“arrow…etched with runes that weren’t language so much as *hunger*”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (acid sea *hisses*, workshop *groans*). Filter verbs rare; strong verbs (“lashed,” “spiraled,” “skimmed”) propel. Final line crackles without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and emotional state (“servers pulsed with ghost-light”). No loops or synonym churn; openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—ghost-light, dying star, confetti wreckage—all share scatter/decay logic. One mixed metaphor blip: “confetti across the Kuiper Belt” is physically off but emotionally accurate; clarity intact. Final line silence earns its paragraph break, giving cadence payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences frequently double-load (advance atmosphere + stakes). Metaphors are coherent—“lighthouse stood sentinel,” “roots tangled like old men”—without mixed logic. One scaffold: “the beam above swept…counting down” appears twice in similar form; minor loop. No artifacts near closure; final mirror-shatter image is clean and earns its density.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.4)
    Sentence-level propulsion is ruthless: “She’d booked a slot…she was here to learn the sound of approaching endings” compresses backstory and motive without scaffold. Metaphors are spare yet physical—silence as “held breath,” parasol as “divining rod”—never layering to purple. Zero loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Final line monosyllabic cut—“She listened.”—delivers cadence payoff taught by earlier groans.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; every sentence advances mood, memory, or choice. Metaphors stay internally coherent (embers, maps, storms) and accumulate toward closure. No filter-verb stacks or loops; "crushed grapes and damp earth" returns only to reweight loneliness at end, earning recurrence. Opening/final lines are sonic and image-matched without scaffolding. Hedges like "almost" appear but are POV-true to Lior’s hesitant sensibility—allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds either new sensory data or causal pressure. Metaphors are coherent—“breath through reeds” extends to the parapet’s later song without contradiction. Information density is high: “the first word ever spoken” compresses cosmology into one sniff. No artifact appears in the final third; the final line’s monosyllabic drumbeat is intentional and pays off the opening whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; metaphor density peaks only in the closure beat where payoff justifies it. No synonym loops or template stems; each lavender reference gains new semantic weight. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously; final line releases with echoing “light.” Micro-copy clean—no tense drift, no misplaced modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose carries high-density double duty: “fractured gold” paints floor and foreshadows sonic fracture. No loops; metaphors stay internally consistent. Minor register lift—“sonically reflective,” “conceptual repricing”—fits scholar POV. Closure beat crystalline, unmuddied.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from fragment pulse to long mist-wrapped clauses; no template cadence. Metaphors (tape = tuning fork, sea = VCR) remain coherent under physical logic. Information density high: one line often carries sensory, symbolic, and causal load. Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; clarity at closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “the idea of it trying to break free” does triple duty—metaphor, stakes, foreshadowing. Rhythm varies from lyrical cadence to urgent fragments without template churn. Only micro-loop is “the sound of leaves falling” repeated at end, but it reweights meaning, hence waived. No mixed metaphors; brass-hand physics stays consistent. Final line “the world—changeless, constant, alive—stepped with him” propels closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace—long lyrical clauses for music, staccato for release. Information density high: single sentence slips blood-work folder, tremor history, and emotional temperature. No mixed metaphors; “crushed lavender underfoot” stays within olfactory logic. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “of” prepositional phrases in opening line, but it does not recur or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between cadenced descriptive lines and hard, clipped revelation beats, supporting the escalatory curve. Mixed metaphors are avoided; brass/ember/frost motifs interlock coherently. Information density is high—each sentence layers physical action with mythic rule-building. A single paraphrase loop (“the key wasn’t just a tool; it was a loop…”) costs 0.2; otherwise scaffold is minimal and the final image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“the garden had taken the wound and spun it into a door” advances plot and reweights metaphor). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are coherent (tooth → lock → star-map) and internally consistent. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Opening and closing lines are sharp—first line poses riddle, last line re-casts her occupation as cosmology. Minor near-repeat of “something older” and “something darker” is the only scaffold trace, not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: participle phrases evoke tide-like cadence without simultaneity errors. Metaphors (sleeping serpent, cat-curl mist) stay coherent within marine physics. One scaffold loop—“reflectively vibrant” repeated verbatim—costs −0.3; otherwise no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Strong verbs (“exhaled,” “carved,” “ignited”) carry motion; nominalizations are minimal. Final line lands on monosyllabic pulse—“quiet places where light learned to stay”—a cadence shift that recharges prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic work (“amber depths holding something ancient and unbroken”). No paraphrase loops; each line advances stance or image. Metaphor vehicles stay vegetal and coherent. Minor register lift in “cathedral” is earned by sustained consecration imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stake. Figurative language is patterned (water, current, spiral) and pays off in the closing image. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One hairline slip—“lucidly watchful” appears twice in close proximity; the repetition is purposeful but momentarily stalls rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; opening long sentence liquefies into shorter breaths as song climbs. Figurative language is selective—“liquid gold,” “moon’s cradle”—and never clusters in high-pressure beats. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image, sound, or causality. Strong verbs (twitched, plumped, wove) replace modifiers. Only micro-slip: “heartbeat slowing” borders cliché but is saved by tactile palm anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: no loops, no scaffold, high density—“flash-paper, thin as dragonfly wings” does double metaphorical and tactile work. Metaphors stay coherent (starlight as frost on iron, song deferred) and never collide. The only hairline slip is the slightly purple “world seemed to hold its breath,” but the phrase is immediately grounded by the windless crater rule. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long ritual sentences to the staccato of success.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional charge, and world rule. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph lengths vary. No scaffold loops or repeated stems. Metaphors stay coherent (light through prism, silver veins). Minor adverb inflation (“softly, like a heartbeat”) is earned by emotional peak. Proofing is clean; pronouns unambiguous. Final line cadence lands as heartbeat resynchronization.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic: long sentences swell, then fracture like ice—“calcified with a sound like ice fracturing.” No loops or filler stacks; every clause adds sensory or causal texture. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent (kelp, rust, moth, whalebone). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new equilibrium without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Information density is high—“coins that jingled like hollow promises” does three jobs: sound, metaphor, thematic comment. Opening line anchors voice and metaphor; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier steam motif. No mixed metaphors or register drift; every verb is strong (“knife biting,” “lions dissolving into smoke”).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers job—image + momentum + interiority. Syntax accelerates into the jump, then fractures to match impact. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: “chipped by wind,” “gears groaned,” “static of a future” all reappear in charged final image. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line density is high: one sentence often jobs setting, symbolism, and causality—“the terminal shuddered, not collapsing, but resurrecting.” No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphors (sextant “hummed with intent”) stay consistent with engineer worldview. Minor scaffold: “not with energy, but with intent” could trim to “hummed with intent,” but brevity remains within tolerance for 750-word count. Cadence varies by paragraph length and sentence shape; opening long sentence vs. final terse exchange (“I’m recalibrating”) supplies closure punch.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates: opening polysyndeton stretches hesitation; climactic fragments mimic metallic chimes. No synonym loops; “whispers” recurs but each time re-weighted—from feared voices to self-echo to liberated ticks. Metaphors stay coherent—clock heart, spider-thread crack—tied to bodily scale. Single line of possible scaffold: “let it mirror the lines on his own face” could compress, yet serves mirror function under high pressure; not closure-touching, so −0.2 only, still within 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths swell and contract with canal breathing. Metaphors are spare, non-contradictory (“blade through old parchment” opens with clear physical logic). No synonym churn or template cadence detected. High information density: single sentences layer salvage ethic, paternal doubt, and setting cue. Minor scaffold: two “like” similes close together could be pruned, but none sit in final third—9+ still reachable.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are controlled—“roots around stone” is physically apt for rope growth. High density: “ghost against the cold” does three jobs (temperature, breath, mortality). Read-aloud rhythm hinges on the final fragment “The snow kept falling. / The harbor kept breathing. / And the knots… began to sing”—a taught triad that pays off prior pattern. No mixed vehicles or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is virtuosic—participle openers, em-dash breathers, fragment punches—creating tidal cadence. Metaphors are mixed but coherent: sails “swallowing the horizon like a sigh” blends ingestion and exhalation yet tracks Elias’s oral act of storytelling. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances knowledge or pressure. Only micro-slip: “the way the wind still moved through the trees” repeats prior “wind” motif, but serves as deliberate echo, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template runs. Metaphors (“shell veined with cracks like forgotten rivers”) remain coherent, not stacked. Information density high: one sentence often performs sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Minor scaffold: “the whole structure groaning under the weight of its own stagnation” slightly restates prior gear imagery, but does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: lapping clauses mirror lagoon, then staccato verbs (“She didn’t hesitate.”) under alarm. High information density—each sentence advances image, emotion, or causality. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (fire, salt, mirror). Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive. Minor tic: three consecutive sentences beginning “She…” in the final beat, but not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, loop-free; each sentence layers job—image, motion, interiority—without scaffold. Metaphors stay physically coherent (V-formations dissolve like held breath). Rhythm rises naturally at rupture: dust / threads snap / city weeps. No overwriting in climax; imagery serves causality. Ear-test passed; opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies from breath-long fragments to rolling clauses that mirror nebular drift; no template cadence. Figurative density is high—“petals of ionized gas,” “slow gravity of forgotten stars”—yet each metaphor is internally coherent and pays off in the final “bridge of resonating light.” One paraphrase loop appears: “the same patterns repeat, the same mistakes, the same slow surrender” could be compressed, but it is purposeful anaphora that teaches the cycle she will break. No mixed metaphors or clarity loss at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and imagistic yet propulsive: “Dusk bled through cracked glass… air thick with wet soil and fading jasmine” performs three jobs in twelve words. One mixed metaphor—“thunder arrived… as a vibration in his ribs” beside “echo of a hundred voices”—is a hairline slip but does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; each advances knowledge or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence mirrors mechanical swing; sentence length literally lengthens as the bob slows. Metaphors are coherent: brass teardrop, tide as held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or paraphrase; every sentence either advances knot, senses, or moral pressure. Metaphors are cross-rooted in horticulture—knots as rhizomes, stars as eyes—maintaining coherent vehicle. No filter-verb stacks; perceptions arrive direct: “fingers still warm,” “scent—wet stone and lavender.” Opening and closing lines perform bookend resonance: ticking clock → clicked door, king fallen → queen alone, soil breath → petal prayer.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent: swallowing light → bloom → flock of starlings form a sustained vehicle chain. Information density is high—“ink distilled from comet dust” does world, tool, and wonder in five words. A lone near-purple phrase “monochrome waste” is allowable under lyric license and does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density: every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is patterned—ember, ash, salt—paid off in final graffiti. Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” is earned by prior metaphor web. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for scattering, clipped fragments for mask clicks. Metaphors are spare and coherent—ashes as snow, mask as clock—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “the trick” and “that was the trick” within 40 words; minor, does not touch closure. High density: ashes/powder/mask each carry plot, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences multitask: “The brass was pitted, its teeth worn uneven… but the weight… was perfect” marries object history to emotional verdict. No scaffold loops; each noun is concrete (warped iron, sludge diary, oilcloth), each verb active (tugged, gleamed, swallowed). Mixed metaphors avoided—city ribs groaning maintains physical logic. Final line delivers a sonic click (“The cog settled… ticking”) that reprises opening image with added mortal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “the autumn wind rattling the panes like an old man tapping his cane” fuses sound, body, and time in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language peaks only at high-emotion beats, never overwrought. Rhythm accelerates into the final shimmer, then arrests—line-level craft mirrors musical fermata.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    Syntactic variety supports emotional respiration; no template cadence detected. High-density lines (“Juice ran over his fingers… mind expanded like dough”) perform three jobs: image, sensory payoff, conceptual shift. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence stems avoid algorithmic drumbeat. Figurative layer (“hummed like a struck tuning fork,” “wings stuttering like a held breath”) is selective, not cluttered; metaphors stay physically coherent. One paraphrase pair—“lacquer box… passed down like the toll keeper’s duty” / “a job no one applied for but no one could refuse”—slips into restatement; mild −0.2. No scaffold loops in final third; information density high; opening and closing lines bracket voice cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “wood softened by decades of salt and silence” performs three jobs—tactile, temporal, metaphoric. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Figurative layer is restrained to one metaphor per beat, avoiding purple clutter. Final line cadence—“Some houses felt alive because they had learned to listen. And so, at last, had she.”—delivers echoing closure without template thud. Minor filter verbs (“she felt like”) are rare and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long silt-laden clauses build pressure, then fracture into sentence fragments at dome-split. Metaphors (“foxglove bruise,” “whalesong and breaking glass”) are sparse, high-yield, never stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances choice or image. Minor register elevation in “ontological” thoughts arguably exceeds stressed diver lexicon, but compression keeps momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density, almost no scaffolding; each sentence advances pattern or texture. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate—“gray haze peeled back like fabric”—and never muddles physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (“moon-tipped,” “wishing-well,” “saffron quiet”) and paid off in the final clarifying image; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided by staying inside the painter’s chromatic lexicon. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence adds either new sensory data or conceptual pressure. Line breaks and paragraphing follow breath units that accelerate toward the sleep-release. The only micro-slip is the vague “static of a thousand sleepless souls,” an abstract intensifier that briefly blurs specificity, but it is isolated and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length varies, paragraph cuts carry new knowledge or charge. No scaffold loops; only two near-metaphors per beat, each paid off (“lichen glowed like old regret” mirrored in shard-stars). Information density high—one sentence often does description + interior tilt + foreshadowing. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not on-page, so spared penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from long, tidal rolls to fragment pulses, mirroring the unwinding mechanism. Figurative language is dense yet precise—“splinter in the throat of the sea” connotes both pain and voicelessness. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the clock/sea fusion. One mixed vehicle—“bruised violet of a storm’s underbelly”—is momentary, but clarity survives and the final image is unmarred.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or action; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent (lung-mirror, film-heartbeat). Register stable; no filter-verb clusters. Minor risk: “repulsive allure” is abstract, but immediately embodied in the puddle-wink. Final line propels outward—“the game… remembered how to play”—without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances sound, sky, or stake. Information-dense lines: “roots tangled in the driftwood’s embrace, its few remaining fruits glowing faintly…” Metaphors are coherent—musical/body/sky vehicles interlock without mixed logic. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors surf cadence. Copy-clean; no tense drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases resonant chord.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is mostly lean but leans on stacked metaphor across two adjacent high-pressure beats (“rose flag,” “ivy strangled,” “ghost engineer,” “gilded frauds,” “weight of a single illuminated letter”)—minor smoothing needed. No loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or charge; grammar and pronouns clean. Register drift at “conceptual repricing” appears only in evaluation not text. Final line delivers clear image without muddle, just inside 9-band ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances action, e.g., “he knelt at the waterline, where the stonework split like a wound” simultaneously reveals setting and triggers the note find. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent. One filter-verb cluster (“he wondered… he thought… he woke”) is brief and voice-motivated. Final line lands with cadence shift that propels closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “waterlogged ledgers,” “brass lamp,” “pressure lock” deliver double duty—worldbuild and characterize. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is spare and exact: “slow breath of the ocean” is the only metaphor, earned by dome imagery and never repeated. Occasional adjective drift (“vast quiet”) is minor and does not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; every sentence layers job triplets (image, motion, emotion); metaphors obey internal physics of sinking-through-sea gravity; final paragraph accelerates into breath-cadence that mirrors isle’s rise—line-level craft charges the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “veil floated upward…intangibly tangible” does triple work (image, concept, emotional sting). Zero loops; no sentence restates prior content. Metaphors stay coherent—storm threads, crystal map, knife of theory—each reappears to sharpen, not decorate. Final clause “hunting” stands alone paragraph for punch; no scaffold needed. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” but fits the science frame already invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic: “stone domes into silhouettes against a sky threaded with the first stars.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are spare and coherent; “brilliant dimness” is oxymoron with thematic payoff. One mixed image—“brilliant dimness”—is intentional and paid off, not muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: high density—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic labor without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (terrace as bruise, tide as filing clerk). One micro-loop: “the way he did when…” appears twice; not enough to dull closure. Final paragraph cadence mirrors tide retreat, sentence lengths ebbing—pattern taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm varies from storm-gust fragments to longer reflective coils without algorithmic pattern. Information density high: “windblown stones slick with mist that curled like ghostly fingers” does three jobs in nine words. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent. One clause—“recycling mistakes into wisdom”—edges toward aphorism but is earned by prior scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “compass grew warm as if sensing hesitation” does triple duty—embodiment, animism, time passage. No synonym loops; each metaphor advances stakes. Final paragraph varies sentence length to create cadential release. Minor scaffolding: two stock phrases (“gathering dusk”, “dying star”) but neither touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers scent, bodily effect, and mythic reference. Rhythm varies from breathy pre-modifiers to hammered imperatives (“she pulled”). No paraphrase loops; only two adjacent “like” similes could be pruned. Mixed metaphors absent; closure beat is clean. Minor scaffold: “the orchard had no answers” edges toward personification cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “Moonlight bled… slow unraveling of regret” does triple sensory work. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; varied sentence openings create natural cadence. One mixed metaphor—“laughter curled around her ankles”—is momentarily visual-ambiguous, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “The needle was a sliver of black glass, honed from the edge of a collapsed star” does world, tool, and myth in one stroke. Metaphors are coherent—bones/prayers, thread/breath, tear/absence—no mixed vehicles. Scaffolding minimal; one paraphrase loop (“stitch…stitch”) is motif-driven, waived. Final paragraph cadence slows to match grass-landing—ear test passes. Clean grammar, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; high density (“glass vials lined up like a constellation” layers visual, tactile, symbolic jobs). Metaphors are coherent—lava “kiss,” tide “flees”—and sustain thermal through-line. No mixed vehicles. Sentence variety: participial openers balanced with blunt monosyllables (“She stepped inside”). Final line anchors echo: hush → her own breath. Copy-clean; no scaffold. Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density—each sentence advances gear or stakes. Figurative control strong (“fort clung like a lantern left burning too long”). A few near-adjacent participles (“His boots made no sound… revealing…”) create micro-simultaneity, but clarity intact. Zero loops or scaffold; earns read-aloud rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or paraphrase; every sentence layers job: “dust... fine as regret” marries tactile grain to emotional weight. Metaphors stay coherent—frictionless world, borrowed dawn, ember-aurora—all serve the same physics-of-absence rule. No overwritten beat; information density peaks as rocks flake “like dead skin” while still advancing ritual stakes. Final line is clean, propulsive, and recharges “friction” as both physical and existential.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lines carry double duty: “the poem in his hands was the same” compresses memory + present object. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensorium or choice. Metaphor stack is deliberate and paid off—storm as editor, scars as roads. One mixed metaphor (“clouds unraveling like a censored line”) is minor amid otherwise coherent figurative logic. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, symbolic, kinetic jobs—“the card landed needle-up, its delicate filigree glinting—a challenge.” Metaphors are coherent (light like shattered diamonds) and physically sustained through refraction choreography. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; action order is sequential and unambiguous. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action-image that recharges “unfinished argument” motif. Minor elevated flourish “brooked doesn’t stall, it waits” stays within philosopher-poet register and is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythmic control: sentence length varies from fragment to lyrical cascade, accelerating with dawn. No paraphrase loops; each line adds texture or knowledge. Figurative language stays coherent—no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “bloom” repeated across three contiguous lines mid-story (−0.2); does not touch closure. High density: “stitched meaning into chaos” does world/character/theme work simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job—image, motion, pressure—without synonym churn. Metaphors (clock “warm,” ozone “smelled of old paper”) stay consistent to the salt-air station register. Final bulb “burning brightest just before it died” is a surgically placed image that accelerates into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or filler; every sentence advances image, choice, or cost. Metaphors are coherent and non-contradictory: seeds as “slow heartbeats” aligns with later island-pulse in her bones. Density is high—“the dreams weren’t echoes. / They were the island itself, trying to remember her”—two lines flip ontology. Rhythm breathes with tension: monosyllabic punch before storm break, then open-mouth vowels as rain fills her. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence mirrors first-line ridge-hum, creating pattern pay-off. Micro-slips: “slow unfurling of nightshade petals” repeats ‘unfurl’ concept but cadence justifies it; keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm: varying sentence length creates tidal cadence; no template churn. Information density high—one sentence often performs sensory, emotional, and symbolic work (“needle bled color—pale, trembling gold, like sunlight through a held breath”). Metaphors are maritime-consistent; no mixed vehicles. Minor loop: “slow-spoken” appears twice but serves as maternal echo, forgiven. Closure sentence—“taught it to lean into the wind”—is clean, strong verb, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield. Opening metaphor (“cathedral of glass and steam… broken teeth”) establishes tone and stakes immediately. Minor figurative density in mid-section (“fractured the air into prismatic ghosts”) borders on ornamental but serves the Accumulative lens. No loops, scaffold, or register errors; final lines land with rhythmic grace (“Like butterfly wings. Like the first breath after a storm.”).

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the ledger’s numbers glowed faintly… set them alight from within”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in two high-pressure beats (“molten tears,” “drifting resonance”), slightly muddying clarity—hence just below 9.0. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“One step. Then another.”) perfectly matches emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“tomb of winterglass,” “heat-map of emotions”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional beats. One minor overwriting slip (“fractured gold of memory”) slightly dilutes peak-beat clarity—but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“ribcage of iron,” “pulse slow like a sleeping beast”) without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or pressure. Syntax varies naturally—short staccato beats during patrol arrival, flowing cadence in reflective passages. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors (“thorns sharp as promises”) are coherent and charged. Final paragraph’s anaphora (“They would…”) earns its rhythm through accumulation, not template. No register drift or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains absolute even in lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “breath form shapes—first a serpent, then a key” advances character, atmosphere, and motif in one stroke. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“voice the sound of petals unfurling”) but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary naturally. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors inhalation—building then resolving—without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: “vines that pulsed like veins” establishes sentience and rhythm in one stroke; “faces dissolving like sugar in rain” merges image, theme, and sensory specificity. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—each sentence propels. Minor figurative density in climax (“photographs screamed… chorus of half-forgotten moments”) skirts overwriting but earns it through payoff (rewoven air). Final line (“maybe… the texture would hold”) resolves with charged poise, echoing the opening’s “whispering secrets.”

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“ivory keys yellowed like old bones” establishes decay and history in seven words). Figurative language is consistent (botanical/metallic motifs) and payoff-driven—the “jagged scar” of the wall echoes in “cracked soil.” Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the final paragraph (“shadow stretching long over the soil she had just armed with life”), where metaphor edges toward abstraction without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield. Figurative language is pattern-taught (colors = sounds, rust = memory) and pays off at closure without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentence openings vary (“He pressed…”, “Elias wasn’t…”, “The first time…”). Minor deduction for slight over-density in the opening paragraph, but no artifact obscures causality or dulls the ending’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “brass rails humming with the weight of trains that had carried secrets” conveys history, sound, and metaphor in one clause. Figurative language intensifies without muddle—moonbeams twist into “a train pulling away,” not mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence propels. Final paragraph’s cadence (“She leapt… She became it”) varies rhythm to mirror transcendence, avoiding syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (ice as memory, glass as inquiry) and avoids muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“breath a fleeting sculpture”) risks purple prose but doesn’t obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “iron shelves sagging like old bones,” “phobia of open water clawed at her ribs like a trapped thing.” Figurative language is consistent (bodily metaphors for emotional states) and never muddles causality. One minor slip: “the very things they called weaknesses were the cracks that let the light in” borders on thematic echo, but earns its place through prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (each sentence advances atmosphere, character, and theme), syntactic variety that mirrors emotional cadence, and zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“ambered hush” recurs with deepening resonance) and never muddled—metaphors cohere within the text’s internal logic (silence as wound/cradle, gold leaf as second skin). The final paragraph’s rhythm enacts dissolution, and every image serves the accumulative drive without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “prismatic shards,” “looped timelines,” “ghost of a fire that had burned out centuries ago” all advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Minor overwriting appears in “fragments of past iterations where it had ignored the violin, where the courtyard had been warm, where it had never asked questions at all”—a slight synonym loop—but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary (“The courtyard was empty…”, “X-7 paused…”, “A wind cut…”), and paragraph lengths create rhythmic breath. Final line (“began to remember how to live”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“water trickling through crystal pavers, each step releasing a whisper of light”). Figurative language is coherent—light, crystals, and lenses form a consistent motif without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm shifts naturally (e.g., staccato dialogue vs. flowing description). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “ghost of it” and “resonant hush,” but closure remains undulled—final lines earn their lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “cracked marbles” gleam like “veins of silver,” hedges “sigh” with “old apologies.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Minor overwriting in “shattered promises” risks abstraction but is grounded by immediate context (marbles scattering light). Final paragraph’s cadence (“wild and withering and perfectly, stubbornly alive”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity. Zero filter-verb stacks or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “cobalt light, twisting like a school of fish” merges setting, motion, and metaphor. Sentence variety supports momentum—fragmented beats (“A wingbeat. Then another.”) contrast flowing descriptions. Minor figurative density in the climax (“holograms bleeding into something solid”) slightly risks overload but pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose achieves near-flawless density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“lanterns flickered above, their light pooling unevenly, turning the sheet music... into a topographic map of shadows”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—water as “patient tongue,” silence as “unstruck chords”—never muddled. Rhythm varies organically, mirroring emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s lyrical compression (“Some conversations didn’t need words to be finished”) lands with earned resonance, not sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “iron ribs groaning” establishes setting, sound, and metaphor). Figurative language is pattern-taught (margins, swallowing, weight) and pays off in closure (“smudges looked like wings”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in high-pressure beat (“pebble of truth… smooth and cold”), but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: opening simile (“tunnel exhaled damp like a sleeping beast”) establishes tone without overwriting. Figurative language is pattern-taught (breath, bones, swallowing) and pays off in Luz’s thread-bulging throat. Minor artifact: “static exploded into a child’s giggle, high and wet, then dissolved into the sound of fabric tearing” slightly overloads auditory imagery, but clarity holds. Final paragraph’s cadence—short sentences punctuating dawn’s arrival—resolves rhythmically without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “regenerative silence,” “river sighed,” “edges blurring” each pull triple duty (atmosphere, character, theme). Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (origami as key/body/mind). Final paragraph’s cadence—short clauses building to “The waiting was the point. The silence was the answer”—propels without purple excess. One near-miss: “charged poise” concept borders abstraction but is grounded by the swan’s physical sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “fingers twisted the hem… like a metronome stuck on allegro” conveys anxiety, musicality, and character in one image.

Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Now, at thirty-four…” / “That was why…” / “As the moon slid…”). Final line (“Some magic… just needed to be heard”) echoes the opening “secret kept from the wind,” closing the acoustic motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence multitasks (e.g., “The dragons didn’t fly away. They pulled.” advances plot, character, and mythos). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (phonograph shelves, axis as pivot). Figurative language intensifies at climax without muddle—the tapestry’s fire “no longer faded” ties directly to ember-light. Final line (“So was he”) echoes opening rhythm, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (light as blade, smoke as question marks) and never muddled.

The final paragraph’s rhythm mimics train tracks—steady, inevitable—without monotony. No register drift; diction stays grounded in Chen’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “silence so thick it decorated the air like frost on glass” merges image, atmosphere, and theme in one clause. Figurative language is consistent (indigo as liquid thought, silence as fabric) with no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in dialogue beats, but rhythm serves pressure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“softer… clearer… alive”) earns its lyricism through accumulated weight.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (ice as cracked mirror, shell as home-plan) and intensifies without muddle. Sentence variety supports emotional arc; paragraph cuts are sharp. Minor density in high-pressure beats (e.g., multiple metaphors in fortune-writing passage) prevents a 9.5+, but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain’s afterglow bleeding into something thicker” does atmosphere, character, and escalation in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (fractured light = fractured time; tablet as living thing) and peaks cleanly. Minor scaffold in “peeled away like wet paper” slightly borders cliché, but earns redemption through context. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“He had always...”, “Between one step...”, “Elias clenched...”). Final paragraph’s cadence (“walked until... became... led”) perfectly echoes thematic progression without drumbeat repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“filament of hush,” “grooves spiraling inward like a secret”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor overwriting slip: “ghost of rhythms not yet born” risks abstraction but is grounded immediately by tactile drumhead inspection. No scaffold or register drift; every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the “held breath” motif, closing the textural loop.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line. Opening metaphor (“breath held between day and night”) pays off in the closing exhale and held silence. Figurative language is coherent—breath, pages, blades—all tied to perception and threat. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-text, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Somewhere, a door creaked… He exhaled… began to record the silence”) achieves perfect rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“leaves crumbled like old parchment,” “petals pulsing like embers”) is coherent and character-filtered. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally with paragraph lengths. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in high-pressure beats, but no artifacts dull the closure image or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“sky was a sieve of starlight”) serves texture without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally (fragments, em-dashes, balanced clauses). Closure beat (“Only the texture of time, unspooling”) resonates without artifact—register stays within poet’s lexicon, no purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is precise (“shipwrecks jutted like ribs,” “silence thick as humidity”) without purple excess. Syntax varies purposefully: periodic sentences for memory, fragments for tension. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; even repeated motifs (bowl, unfinished melody) evolve functionally. Final line’s cadence—“the chronic hush, at last, learned to sing”—resolves the opening’s suspended note with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“walls pulsing with trapped sunlight, slow as a held breath”). Figurative language is coherent—light “thickens,” scent “unfolds,” static “maps cowardice”—with no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary (“Liora adjusted…”, “Her client…”, “She let…”), and paragraph cuts heighten rhythm. Zero paraphrase loops; even repeated motifs (“petal knew,” “static told”) accrue meaning. Final line (“Ready.”) echoes opening breath, closing the cadence with charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“the symphony’s last note dissolved into the salt-kissed breeze”). Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph lengths mirror rhythm of revelation. Minor overwriting in “grin reminded him of the way his mother had laughed when she thought no one was counting” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line’s metaphor (“spaces between the notes”) is earned, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“villagers called her Reed because she carved kin from what others discarded”). Figurative language is coherent (reeds → scars → carvings; violet tags → crater glow → paint). Minor overwriting in the orchard description (“fruit that refracts light into stories no one alive could read”) slightly dilutes momentum, but peak beats avoid muddle. Final paragraph’s rhythm (“not with words, but with the ache of recognition”) perfectly cadences the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “ink bled upward… pooling into the shape of a key” conveys defiance, transformation, and plot pivot in one image. Rhythm varies purposefully—long sinuous sentences for description (“labyrinth of canals carved into rooftops”) fracture into staccato beats during climax (“She hurled the jar… water hissed, then stilled”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every modifier serves causality (“teeth sharp as a clock’s hands” implies time’s violence). Figurative coherence: bioluminescence, ink, and silver thread form a luminous motif that culminates in the echo-leash’s dissolution, never straining logic. Final line (“echoes… only just beginning to speak”) recharges opening silence with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“each fracture a variable, each color a coefficient”) and avoids loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (prism → unnamed colors → harmonic vibration) and intensifies without muddle in peak beats. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional rhythm, and every image advances character or theme. Final line (“quiet mathematics of the possible”) resolves by recharging the opening’s “silver pulse” with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “dawn bled through stained glass,” “laugh spilling out in fragments—high, then broken, then clear as a bell” show high information density. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—longer cadences for memory, staccato for tension. One minor flaw: “magnetic strip warm from his body heat” slightly over-explains; could trust “warm fragment” given prior context. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“leaves trembled—not from wind, but unseen pulse”; “roots split stone path… branches wove as collaborators”). Figurative language is coherent (metamorphosis motif sustained from leaf texture to cellular reconstruction to Liora’s laughter). Minor overwriting in “glistened like a living tapestry” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm (“leaf by leaf, cell by cell…”) masterfully echoes the story’s accumulative drive.

Figurative language is pattern-taught (metal as beast, voice as bleeding) and pays off (“sky bled into the land”). Minor overwriting in two mid-story sentences (“script describing a path… where the earth still remembered green”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure beats are pristine—“vines tightened,” “air smelled of rain”—with zero loops or scaffold.

Minor deduction for slightly dense figurative layering in the climax (“weights swirling like embers”), though pattern-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—nearly every line does double duty (e.g., “tears were for the living, and she was already half-gone” conveys state, backstory, and worldview). Figurative language is pattern-taught (fractured light, hollow promises, rust-hued peace) and pays off in the closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary naturally. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-text, but no artifact dulls the closure beat—final lines (“One cut at a time”) land with rhythmic inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “paint chipped by wind that never ceased,” “coiled in her ribs, heavy as the camera wheel,” “laughter was the sound of a gear grinding to a halt.” Figurative language is consistent (mechanical/memory motifs) and avoids muddle. Sentence variety mirrors emotional cadence—short staccato beats during confrontation, flowing clauses during the fall. One minor slip: “fractured stillness” slightly abstract, but immediately grounded by the ghost’s voice cutting through it.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “corroded steel stretched toward a sky the color of old bruises” does triple duty (setting, tone, emotion). Figurative language is purposeful—no purple prose—and metaphors cohere (maze, circuit board, veins). Minor artifact: “ghostly outlines of departure gates that had once promised escape” slightly over-embellishes, but doesn’t obscure causality. Final line (“I’m recalibrating”) lands with perfect syntactic economy, echoing the sextant’s function without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: each image pulls thematic, atmospheric, and character weight (“fractured whispers—voices of a time before silence”). Figurative language is coherent (whispers as vines, silence as companion) and peaks without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary organically. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in climactic paragraph, but rhythm remains purposeful and unsluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“its hull groaning with the weight of forgotten things” establishes setting, mood, and thematic weight). Minor overwriting in one beat: “the kind of quiet that made a person’s thoughts louder than they’d like” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by immediate concrete action (tying the rope). No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (blade/parchment, wounds/ink). Final line’s propulsion (“And so did she”) earns its simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-perfect information economy—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (knots as language, glass as memory) and never muddled; metaphors cohere physically and thematically. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and closure lines (“the knots, at last, began to sing”) land with earned lyricism. No loops, scaffold, or purple excess—every modifier serves texture without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “sails swallowing the horizon like a sigh” establishes tone, stakes, and motif in one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (thread as question, lifeline, compass) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “bruise of violet and ash” risks purple prose, but it pays off in the storm/revelation duality. No loops or scaffold—every sentence propels. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Like the thread. Like the tide…”) earns its lyricism through accumulated weight.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density (“veined with cracks like forgotten rivers”), varied sentence openings, and rhythmic propulsion that breathes with scene needs. Figurative language is pattern-taught (song/gears, feathers/iron) and payoff-earned—the “stained glass” wings refract earlier motifs into new meaning. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Minor deduction for slight over-density in the hatching paragraph (three consecutive metaphor-laden lines), but clarity remains intact and closure is undulled. Final line crystallizes the entire piece with zero fat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“kelp-drift peace,” “scorched earth,” “stubborn scars could sing”—but avoids overwriting; each metaphor serves character or theme. Sentence variety supports emotional cadence, though one minor loop appears: “the red thread had darkened with the boy’s blood, but the stitches held” slightly paraphrases earlier binding action. No scaffold, no register drift, and closure image (“scar would have its song”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“coins turned green by time,” “memories… sticky as honey”). Figurative language is coherent—geese dissolve “like a breath held too long,” light bleeds “through her skin”—without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary naturally. Closure beat (“the city breathed. And so did she”) is clean, resonant, and artifact-free. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“sidereal patience”) that risks abstraction but is immediately grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “petals of ionized gas drifting in the slow gravity of forgotten stars” establishes setting, tone, and physics in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (light as borrowed, memory as fuel) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overuse of luminescence metaphors in mid-story, but no loops or scaffold. Final lines (“Somewhere, a child would ask…”) land with resonant simplicity, avoiding purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“His fingers… twitched—not from fatigue, but from the weight of the question”). Figurative language is precise (“wings like stained glass,” “thunder arrived… as a vibration in his ribs”) and coheres within the carver’s worldview. Minor overwriting in one beat (“a river of wings blocking the last of the light”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm—short clauses building to “It’s ours”—perfectly echoes the story’s thematic cadence without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brass teardrop suspended in the hush between ticks” establishes voice and stakes immediately. Figurative language is coherent (names as weights, tide erasing debts) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Final line (“began to carve the next name”) echoes opening rhythm while deepening meaning—high information density without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)

Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One near-risk: “dried blood and forgotten violets” borders on purple, but earns its place by anchoring the tapestry’s uncanny texture. Final paragraph’s cadence (“marigolds trembled… door clicked shut”) delivers flawless closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, every sentence advancing atmosphere, character, or plot—no scaffolding. Figurative language is coherent: spire as blade, ink as bloom, future as clay pot—all reinforce core metaphors without strain. Sentence openings vary (“The obsidian spire…”, “Liora adjusted…”, “She was…”, “Her tools…”), rhythms breathe with scene needs. Zero loops or synonym churn; even high-density passages (“network of bridges… city of glass domes… path winding…”) avoid purple overload by anchoring abstractions in tactile verbs (“took form,” “walk unharmed”). Final line (“first footprints… not the last”) echoes opening spatially while recharging theme—perfect closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“ink on paper wasn’t enough; the dust needed to learn how to tell its own stories”). Figurative language is coherent—light, sound, and dust form a consistent sensory network. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in the opening paragraph, but none obscures causality or dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-flawless rhythm and syntactic variety. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—e.g., “the mask’s fractures refracted the gallery’s dim light, casting fractured patterns onto the floor like a code no one else could read” does triple duty. Figurative language is consistent (fracture, dissolution, mirage) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-text, but no loops, scaffolding, or artifacts that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or pressure. Opening line (“stank of old copper and newer lies”) establishes voice and stakes instantly. Figurative language is controlled (“water dripping… like slow, mocking applause”; “pulse synced to its silent rhythm”)—no mixed metaphors or overwriting. Final paragraph’s juxtaposition (“Sewer collapse claims one… The cog settled… ticking”) delivers devastating irony with zero scaffolding. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stained-glass windows bleeding amber across the shelves like slow fire” establishes tone without overwriting. Figurative language is coherent (light/fire/bleeding motifs recur organically), and sentence openings vary (“Elias turned it…”, “Outside, autumn stripped…”, “He pressed his ear…”). One minor artifact: “subtracting noise—the kind that drowned out quiet things” slightly abstracts, but closure beat (“rosette vibrated, just slightly”) redeems with concrete specificity. Zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“juice ran over his fingers, and the moment it touched his tongue, his mind expanded like dough”). Figurative language is coherent (baking/growth motifs never clash) and peaks under pressure without purple excess. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (midnight tendril → dawn fruit). Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“synaptic plasticity”) that risks register drift, though context salvages it. Read-aloud rhythm varies masterfully, from staccato planting to lush ripening.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “raw as honey from a crushed comb,” “drones danced like they’d never known a grid.” Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, never muddled. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with rhythm, and every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; the final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line yield: “earth and something older, like the first moment before a held breath is released” conveys scent, time, and anticipation in one image. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentence openings vary naturally. Figurative language is coherent (silence as breath, houses as listeners) and never muddled. The only minor flaw: slight over-reliance on simile in the opening paragraph, but it serves voice and stakes without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “marble arches sagging under centuries” establishes decay in one phrase; “foxglove-stained glass catching bioluminescence” merges object and setting. Figurative language serves causality—barnacles skittering shows motion without stating it. Minor artifact: “tap-tap-tapping” slightly over-modifies, but pattern pays off in dome’s groan. Zero loops; every sentence advances pressure, character, or atmosphere. Final line (“Now we breathe”) echoes opening’s “silent hum” with transformed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, openings avoid repetition, paragraphs breathe with emotional beats. Figurative language is purposeful (“gray haze peeled back like fabric”) and consistent. Minor overwriting in “equations weren’t just abstract; they were a map”—slightly abstract for peak beat—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; high information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (“moon like a coin dropped into a wishing well”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the narrative pulse. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. The final lines (“The moon, waxing still, watched him work”) land with earned quietude, not flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose maintains high information density without overwriting: “flour dusting her wrinkles like ash” conveys age, craft, and elegy in seven words. Figurative language is coherent (lichen = regret, dough = memory) and never muddles causality. Sentence openings vary organically; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. The sole minor flaw: slight register elevation in “sharp green ache of something returned,” though justified by thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“splinter in the throat of the sea,” “hunger stones”) and pays off in closure (“the island exhaled”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each image builds toward the final reconfiguration. Minor deduction for one slightly overloaded modifier (“bruised violet of a storm’s underbelly”), but clarity never falters, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense but propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “burnt sugar and copper pennies” conveys smell, history, and emotional residue). Figurative language is consistent (light/film/mirror motifs) without muddle. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“fistful of blackened filmstrip”) slightly slows momentum but doesn’t obscure closure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“The game wasn’t over. It had only just remembered how to play.”) delivers resonant propulsion without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent (clouds as unplayed sheet music, sound blooming like a bruise) and never muddled. Rhythm varies purposefully—paragraphs breathe or accelerate with Leeward’s strikes. Zero loops or scaffold; even repeated elements (fractals, mallet’s weight) evolve in meaning. Final line’s “world leaned in to listen” pays off the opening’s “world held its breath” with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “iron teeth fused by time and salt” establishes texture economically; “harmonic resonance... settled in his ribs like a second heartbeat” merges sensation and metaphor without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—each sentence advances knowledge, atmosphere, or pressure. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the final paragraph (“Some questions weren’t meant to be answered...”) which edges toward abstraction, though rescued by concrete action (“Elyas didn’t look back”).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence multitasks (e.g., “ivy strangled the iron bones” conveys setting, theme, and decay). Figurative language is controlled: the petal as “surrender flag,” the **B** as “sun,” never muddled. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph cuts that heighten tension (e.g., single-line “He didn’t run.”). Only minor density risk: “gilded frauds” slightly edges toward abstraction, but context grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “the foundation stones... held fast even as the city above them raced forward”). Figurative language is coherent—water “keeps what hands forget,” cracks “ache”—and avoids purple excess. Minor overwriting in “interlaced absence was its power” slightly abstracts an otherwise concrete passage, but rhythm remains varied and purposeful. Final paragraph’s dream sequence risks slight momentum drag but pays off in the salt-on-tongue sensory return.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “waterlogged ledgers, their pages warped but still legible” conveys setting, character skill, and theme in one phrase. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., short paragraph after “It had been waiting”). Minor overwriting in “slow breath of the ocean pressing against the glass dome”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; information density remains high throughout, especially in the climactic ledger discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and forward motion. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“sorrow had bent gravity,” “steam curled like unspoken promises”) and pays off in the cranes’ glowing flight. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; even high-pressure beats avoid therapy-speak. Minor deduction for one slightly overloaded clause (“luminous and white-hot, the kind that didn’t just hurt but rewrote”), but clarity never falters at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“lightning stitching the ruins,” “geode pulsed... as if the storm had seeped into its core”). Figurative language is coherent (storm as sentient pressure, observatory as splinter) and peaks without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts heighten rhythm (alarms wail → Lena smiles). Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“intangibly tangible”) that risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“servos whirring like a held breath”). Figurative language is coherent and patterned (light as blood, sky as fabric) without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—each image builds toward the constellation payoff. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors ascent: short clause (“She let him take it.”), then expansive drone exit, closing on earned stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“its filigree edges worn smooth by years of fretting”). Figurative language is coherent (terrace as “bruise,” hush as “sifting”) and avoids purple excess. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“hush of waves sifting through the silence”) echoes and reweights the opening, closing the sonic motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “mist that curled like ghostly fingers,” “moon hung at half-mast.” Figurative language is purposeful, not decorative. One minor redundancy: “windblown stones slick with mist” slightly overlaps with later “storm-worn.” Otherwise, syntax varies, paragraphs breathe, and every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Closure image (“storm swallowing their footprints”) is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict (“ropes frayed where they’d been cut loose—just like Elias’s promises”). Figurative language is purposeful (“water darkened into the kind of blue that swallowed apologies whole”) without overload. Minor artifact: slight synonym churn in regret descriptions (“regrets,” “failure,” “hollow”), but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“done following lights that couldn’t lead him home”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the city’s pulse muted to a distant hum, like a heart behind too many ribs” does triple duty. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances theme, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (light as memory, water as judge) and peaks cleanly at the throw. Final line (“untouched by time”) resonates without overstatement, closing the motif with earned quietude.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: “petals unfurling like secrets whispered between stars” establishes tone, setting, and theme in one image. Figurative language is coherent—spice metaphors evolve logically from scent to ritual to transformation—and never muddles causality. Minor overwriting in two mid-story sentences (“hues of rebirth,” “gravity of absence”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure beats remain lean and resonant. Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: “inkwell… black and viscous as a starless sky” conveys object, mood, and metaphor in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Figurative language is coherent (time pools, cracks sigh, stars watch) and peaks cleanly—no purple prose muddle. Final lines (“like a benediction. Like a beginning”) vary rhythm while echoing the opening’s celestial motif, closing the cadence arc without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ship of bones—human bones, bolted together with the last prayers” establishes voice immediately. Figurative language serves causality (tears as “absence of weight,” thread as “spun breath”). Minor artifact: “lighter than it should have been” slightly abstract, but quickly grounded in floating. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent (“volcano exhaled,” “celestial bodies dragged their heels”) and peaks without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. One minor risk: “borrowed time” borders cliché, but context renews it. Closure beat (“horizon was a blade of gold”) is sharp, resonant, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“lantern left burning too long”) is purposeful, not decorative. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the climax (hatch-to-armory transition could breathe), but closure image (“shadow in a fort that no longer knew how to hold them”) is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or pressure. Figurative language is coherent (“slick as a breath held too long,” “paint flaking like dead skin”) and avoids muddle. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual tension. Minor deduction for slight over-density in opening beat (three metaphors in first two sentences), but clarity at closure remains unharmed. Final line (“footsteps the only friction left”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but occasional figurative stacking (“jagged veins illuminating the glass dome,” “clouds unraveling like a censored line”) slightly overloads two peak beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully (staccato during tearing, flowing during descent). Minor register drift in “furiously tranquil” (slightly academic) is offset by visceral context. Closure image (“page was blank”) lands with clarity despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“sparks flying as steel met brass” conveys action, tension, and materiality).

Final line (“Let’s make it worth the wait”) resonates without redundancy, echoing the opening’s patience motif.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “moon clawed free of the skyline” establishes tone without overwriting; “ink made from soot and rainwater” concretizes resistance. Figurative language is pattern-taught (molting cicada → names as shed skins) and pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“His fingers...”, “The library...”, “A clatter...”). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in “fractured luminous thing,” but it serves Elias’s poetic lens without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivories yellowed by salt and time,” “longing steely as the blade of a knife unsheathed after a long war.” Figurative language serves causality (compasses flicker “like dying fireflies” foreshadowing their stillness). Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “ozone and old paper” description, but no artifacts dull closure. Final line (“wind carried it forward instead of away”) perfectly recharges the opening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “iridescent things that pulsed like slow heartbeats” does triple duty (image, rhythm, stakes). No paraphrase loops or scaffold—every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (memory as tapestry, ridge as spine) and peaks without muddle. Minor deduction for slightly elevated diction in “empirical whimsy,” but it’s character-consistent and doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“wind combing through saltgrass like fingers through a lover’s hair” establishes tactile intimacy immediately). Minor overwriting in peak beats—e.g., “pale, trembling gold, like sunlight through a held breath”—edges toward purple but pays off in the cerulean payoff. Zero loops or scaffold; information density high. Final line (“taught it to lean into the wind”) perfectly echoes opening imagery, closing the rhythmic arc without redundancy.
