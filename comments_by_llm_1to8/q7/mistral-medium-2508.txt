  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("clawed its ribs bare," "blackened stems, petals dissolved into pulp"), but suffers from repetitive structures ("He wasn't planting. He was mapping") and some overwriting in metaphorical density. The final section contains mild template cadence ("Like butterfly wings. Like the first breath. Like the beginning") that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "frost...like forgotten script" and "molten tears." But template cadence appears: "She stepped...One step. Then another." Multiple philosophical abstractions in final third ("Not to create, but to follow..." "Maybe purpose wasn't in the making...") create paraphrase loops. Filter verb clusters ("She thought of," "She felt like") dull immediacy in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density in most passages. However, abstract phrases like "raw, unshaken marvel" and "fractured harmonies" in peak beats reduce clarity. Minor paraphrase loop with "She wasn't translating silence into music. / She was proving they'd been the same thing all along" restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears briefly ("She struck...She pressed...She exhaled").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The tide had long since swallowed the city, but Elias Vey still kept his ledger dry" establishes setting, character, and tension). Some figurative density in places ("trapped scream," "sea...coughed up a piece of its own guilt") but generally serves the accumulative mode without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from abstraction and telling. Lines like "kindness was now a crime" and "some declarations don't need words" summarize rather than dramatize. The piece would benefit from more concrete scene work, particularly in the middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density serves the accumulative mode with lines doing multiple jobs, but figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("spine of crumbling stone...wreathed in twilight's violet haze"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("unused love" concept restated), and the metaphoric vehicle shifts between botanical and architectural without full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("branches twisting in fractal patterns only she could decipher—each curve a question"). Some metaphor density in peak beats ("needle stitching her into a pattern") without clear payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("She reached...She climbed") but varies sufficiently. The opening and closing images of texture create effective bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "roots through stone" and effective variation in sentence length. However, several instances of abstract telling ("Resilience didn't grow in straight lines") and some repetitive phrasing around seeds/planting in the final third reduce momentum. The philosophical abstractions ("Not with force, but with grace") interrupt the otherwise concrete narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong imagistic precision and varied syntax create momentum, though some abstract phrases ("the color of a promise kept too long") occasionally obscure immediacy. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for scattered instances of elevated diction that drift from the established register and one paraphrase loop ("Trust didn't break like glass. / It eroded. / It rusted.").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language, creating exhaustion. Template structures appear ("She'd spent three nights watching... Quietly savvy, that was how...") and several paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly in the extended ending sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"frost-starred window" conveys temperature, time, and beauty. Some redundancy appears in the reflection passages ("She'd spent years...each one a failed attempt"), and filter verbs occasionally cluster, but prose generally maintains momentum with varied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and strong specific details. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "She wasn't Jacob's shadow. She wasn't the studio's liability" repeats the erasure concept. Template cadence appears in the final section with multiple "She [verb]" constructions. Mixed metaphor with water as both feared element and navigational current slightly muddies the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The pages whispered against his palms, their edges brittle as dried reeds" combines sound, texture, and fragility. Some figurative density in middle sections ("silence of her sword leaving its sheath") but pattern remains purposeful. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some abstract passages slow momentum ("fragments of past iterations where it had ignored the violin"). Template cadence appears in middle section ("X-7's core temperature dropped... X-7's audio receptors picked up"). Strong opening and closing lines partially compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity but suffers from repetitive structures ("She [verb]" appears 8+ times) and abstract summaries ("mistrust thawed"). The paraphrase loop "She didn't need to hear it to know. / She just needed to listen" weakens the ending. Strong imagery partially compensates but template cadence and conceptual redundancy accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("She remembered," "She set," "She tucked") and abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("living puzzle," "stolen luck," "fuller hearts"). The paraphrase loop of "The garden knew its gardener" appears four times without sufficient variation, and filter constructions ("she knew," "she thought") distance key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in "He pulled./The nexus hummed" sequence and slight overwriting in metaphorical density ("school of fish caught in a slow, sideways current") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong sensory density and rhythm variation. Information density high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Some figurative density in early beats ("throat holding a scream," "patient tongue") without full pattern-teaching. Template cadence emerges briefly in ghost revelation sequence ("The ghost had been... That much he'd... She'd died...") but recovers for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence: "The mountain weather station clung to the ridge like a half-healed scar." However, abstract philosophizing creates density issues: "truths were heavy things to swallow, and heavier still to regurgitate" feels overwrought. Some metaphors strain ("the weight in her ribs dissolved like salt in water"), and occasional template constructions appear ("She could... Or she could...").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The factory had used these wheels to regulate steam pressure" provides backstory while advancing present action). Strong verb choices and varied syntax create natural rhythm. Minor deduction for one instance of elevated diction slightly outside POV lexicon ("drowsy, alert second") but prose remains clean and propulsive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density with lines like "the air thick with the scent of decay and something older—regenerative silence." However, some abstract passages ("meaning was not something to grasp but to let slip through your fingers") and repetitive constructions ("Somewhere, the river sighed. Somewhere, time drifted") create minor momentum drag without full pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("roots drinking rain"). Information density high in opening paragraphs. However, some template phrasing appears ("For a heartbeat, nothing") and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy. The final section feels slightly rushed with tell-heavy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, plot). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, especially in peak moments. Information unfolds efficiently without loops or scaffolding. Deduction for occasional figurative density that approaches overwriting ("bronze quiet hum" and similar constructions cluster without full payoff) and one instance of slight register elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "the ink still damp with something heavier than soy sauce" conveys both physical detail and emotional weight. Some template cadence in fortune iterations and mild repetition of "somewhere" in the penultimate section. Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax, though occasional abstraction ("transposing life into a new key") lacks concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("frost on glass," "color of understanding"). However, repetitive sentence structures in the ending sequence ("The novice..." x3, "The..." x8 in final lines) create template cadence. Some abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("unraveled stillness").

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the frozen lake stretched like a cracked mirror, its surface splitting the dawn into jagged reflections—a horizon that refused to stay still"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though occasional elevated diction ("treble clef," "overture") slightly strains the register in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shattering glass in reverse"), but some figurative density in peak beats without full payoff ("darkening brightness," "wet paper" similes cluster). Information density is high and propulsive. Template cadence appears briefly ("He looked... He had... He walked") but doesn't pervade. The final sequence maintains momentum through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The cavern's silence was the kind that enthralled, the kind that made a man lean in"). Some repetitive constructions appear ("the way," "the kind that") but serve rhythmic purpose. The final dream sequence maintains momentum while delivering closure through concrete image rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in atmospheric passages. However, several overwrought phrases strain clarity ("courtyard was a breath held," "last sigh of rain") and filter verb clusters appear ("he thought of," "he'd once believed"). Some paraphrase loops emerge around the integrity theme. Template cadence in "Elias [verb]" constructions appears but doesn't dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative language feels slightly forced ("blade" for scent, "erosion" for grief). Minor template cadence in "He [verb]" constructions mid-story. The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high—most lines advance both external action and thematic weight. Some mild overwriting in figurative language ("sieve of starlight," "metronome") and occasional template phrasing ("He didn't look back. He never did.") but these don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with evocative specific details like "skeletal remains of shipwrecks jutted from the earth like the ribs of forgotten beasts." Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV consistency ("mendicant," "echo-harbor"). The final sequence from the girl's sleep through dawn maintains excellent propulsion. Minor metaphor density in places without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation, though some ornamental figurative language ("walls pulsing with trapped sunlight, slow as a held breath") and repetitive structural patterns in the closing section. Information density is high in action beats but philosophical abstractions accumulate in the final third without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some overwriting appears ("the quiet hum of things finding their way" borders on purple), and there's occasional register elevation that doesn't fully align with the POV. The parenthetical aside works well as a structural choice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("yawned the Shimmer Crater") but mostly serves the lyric mode. Minor repetition in "Reed didn't chase" following similar phrasing, but information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "the city stuttered" and "echoes arrived before their sounds." Some redundancy appears ("She already knew. The canals would run backward.") and occasional overwriting ("thin as paper," "sharp as a clock's hands"). The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density and purposeful rhythm, but some paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "Some things can't be preserved"/"Some things couldn't be preserved" and the mathematics metaphor occasionally over-explains itself. The prose achieves moments of excellence ("the kind that settles like sediment") but inconsistently.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with selective detail ("ferromagnetic tape, its edges frayed") and varied syntax that supports pacing. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot simultaneously. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("sapphire hush," "raw and bright") and some repetitive constructions in middle sections ("He slid," "He wedged," "He reached").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("steam rising from the leaves") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She had spent years... She had stayed...") and occasional overwriting in figurative density. The paraphrase loop around transformation concepts ("This wasn't adaptation. This was metamorphosis.") and some template cadences in the middle section diminish momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative precision ("wound scabbed over," "crooked trails," "fossil map") without overwriting. Some filter-verb clustering in the vision sequence ("flooded him," "released him") dulls immediacy. Information density high throughout with lines doing multiple jobs, though "wry and weary" creates minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("starlight trapped in tar") with strong rhythm variation, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("sheer *weight* of its silence") and abstract passages that slow momentum. Some metaphors strain (shadows as "wet silk"), and the final section contains mild redundancy about not looking back.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("ghost of a note, not sounded, but *navigated*"). Template cadence appears in middle sections ("Elias didn't... He just..."). Some abstract telling ("he *heartened*") and slight overwriting in metaphors reduce momentum but don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm, though some figurative density in peak moments ("stars above bleeding through like wounds") and occasional elevated diction ("yawned wider," "twilight") create minor friction. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. The final image of the crease effectively recharges earlier mapping motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of clarity and propulsion ("She didn't believe the tile could *summon* him, but if it could sculpt space for his echo, she'd carve the whole sky"). However, the extended coda contains paraphrase loops ("The story, after all, was never hers alone. / It was the sea's. / The stars'.") and template cadence in short declarative lines that reduce momentum. Some abstract phrasing ("pocket of stillness," "entangled memories") lacks concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"prismatic escondite hummed like a struck bell" establishes setting, tone, and instability simultaneously. Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("bent light into knives," "marrow of infinite years") without clear payoff. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the transformation sequence where short declaratives accelerate pace.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments like "ink pot tucked into her coat like a second heartbeat" and maintains momentum through varied sentence structure. Deductions for filter verb clusters ("Lira knew," "she thought") and some overwriting in metaphorical density ("the serpent had no end. Neither, now, did she") that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variety and information density, with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, template cadence appears in repeated "He [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The phrase "incandescent restraint" feels forced and doesn't match the established voice. Some paraphrase loops occur, particularly around the concept of collecting textures.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Container 47-B held a man once"—worldbuilding, atmosphere, thematic echo). Some template cadence in middle sections ("Daniel had," "Daniel would," "He began") and occasional register elevation ("syrupy," "labyrinth's maw") but propulsion remains clear through to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("The observatory groaned as the wind shifted") with strong rhythmic control. However, some metaphoric density approaches overwriting ("needling toward something"), and phrases like "reimagined through the warble" create mild opacity. The filter-verb cluster around "felt" appears but doesn't dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied syntax and concrete imagery ("patchwork of barges," "acrid tang of frying dough"). Information density high—most lines advance multiple layers. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("gnawed at her," "living chaos") and one paraphrase loop around Lumina teaching her to build, but no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the universe clearing its throat." Some repetitive structures appear ("Elias knelt," "Elias smiled," "Elias exhaled") and occasional overwriting ("swollen with unspoken promises"). The final image achieves high density with multiple layers of meaning compressed effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong sensory density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The mist clung...like a second skin"). Rhythm varies naturally between long descriptive passages and short decisive actions. Minor deductions for occasional over-density in figurative language ("like whispers through a crowded room") and slight repetition in tactile descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful compression ("She wasn't supposed to be here" creates immediate tension). Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("quiet catastrophe," "worrying tranquility") and one instance of elevated diction drift ("unfolded, a slow bloom of liquid darkness") that slightly strains the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean prose with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Each sentence advances atmosphere or action without loops or scaffolding, though occasional elevated diction ("infinitely patient," "metronome ticking") slightly strains the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. Deductions for repetitive "She [verb]" constructions in the ending sequence and some paraphrase loops like "done answering"/"had harnessed." The filter-verb cluster in the final section ("she decided," "she thought") dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the lighthouse stood like a rusted needle" establishes setting, tone, and threat simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful fragments. Minor repetition of "copperlight" works as pattern. Slight deduction for occasional abstraction ("hungrier affinity") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths creates breathing momentum, though occasional abstraction ("wound healing backward") strains clarity. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, and the prose maintains consistency without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with moments like "the labyrinth had always been a place of broken rules," but several instances of abstract telling weaken momentum: "haunting optimism," "something yet unnamed." Some paraphrase loops appear ("The wharf was waiting" echoes earlier setup). Information density could be higher in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory specificity. Information density is good - most lines advance multiple layers. Deductions for repetitive "Elias + verb" constructions in several passages and occasional overwriting ("bones wrapped in frayed cloth, the skeletal fingers tangled").

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("worn smooth by years of use" establishes both time and tactile detail). Some metaphor density in the opening could thin, but rhythm varies naturally and no paraphrase loops appear.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong opening line and resonant closure with "The stars were singing." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("adjacent possibilities," "echoed silence") and mild overwriting in metaphors like "threaded a silver needle through the fabric of the cosmos" reduce clarity. Some filter-verb clustering around "Elias smiled," "Elias exhaled."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied syntax, though occasional abstraction dilutes immediacy ("regret, maybe, or the weight of a choice not yet made"). The prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in passages linking the shard's healing to emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs—"mist coiled around her ankles, cool as the memory of the operating tent." Some metaphor clustering in opening paragraphs ("bruise of violet and gold," "labyrinthine grooves") creates mild overwriting. Strong information density and propulsion in dialogue exchanges; the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Some overwriting in figurative density ("moss like a memory half-forgotten," "liquid ways") and occasional abstract phrasing. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful fragments and varied syntax. Information density high in places ("The cycle wasn't a trap. / It was an invitation."). However, some template cadence appears ("Liora never returned—not really. / But the murals kept changing.") and repetitive stems in the ending dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong information density with sentences doing multiple jobs (characterization + worldbuilding + atmosphere). Some overwriting appears in peak moments ("burn with questions no ledger could answer") and occasional register drift. Line-level control is generally clean with varied sentence structures, though a few passages lean abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("bones humming with the weight of unsaid verses"). Some figurative density in places but pattern-taught and purposeful. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor repetition of "she" openings in middle section prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery, but contains some overwriting ("half-remembered dream," "gently systematic grace") and abstract phrasing ("museum of extinct feelings"). The final section achieves powerful brevity with "The library was still. And so was she," though earlier passages occasionally strain for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery, but the ending suffers from repetitive structure ("The point was...") and some paraphrase loops. Filter verbs cluster in emotional beats ("She knew, now"). Information density is high in the main narrative but dilutes in the extended coda with redundant thematic restatements.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, propulsive prose with varied sentence structures and strong verbs ("carving," "sagging," "stuttered"). Information density is high—most sentences advance plot while building atmosphere. Some figurative density in opening paragraphs ("slumbering beast," "throat of stone") but purposeful for establishing tone. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("harmony of flow").

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dust motes swirling in currents he'd learned to read like sheet music") with good information density. Some figurative density in places ("wings cutting through dust-mote constellations") and occasional overwrought moments ("the attic held the shape of a song instead of its absence") prevent higher scoring, though these don't touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in descriptive passages ("like a bird deciding whether to take flight"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("featherly determined" appears twice, "fractured hush") without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence emerges briefly in the sinkhole discovery sequence but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Information density high in descriptions like "tiny, drifting jellyfish with photophores that flickered in Morse code." Some minor figurative density in places ("groaned in harmony with the planetary tide") but serves accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("crater glass embedded in the iridescent walls like forgotten stars") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "missing pieces" and abstract constructions ("the universe's way of being kind"). Some sentences do multiple jobs effectively, though density occasionally obscures clarity ("seeds marking the way like breadcrumbs of possibility, each one whispering conjecture").

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful fragments ("Not for them"). Information density is high—most sentences advance both external action and Lior's philosophy. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("Monotony was a canvas") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "waterlilies curled like clenched fists" and "the stars themselves had stitched it there." Some abstract passages weaken density ("something older. / Something that had always been waiting"). Minor repetition in "She had always been good at slipping through" echoes earlier phrasing but serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Some figurative density in peak moments ("mist like the inside of a lung," "wings cutting through mist like a blade through silk") but coherent within the lyric mode. Minor template cadence in "Elias [verb]" constructions but not pervasive.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the ridge was a spine between two valleys." However, several issues accumulate: redundant phrasing ("weight in his chest"/"weight in his pocket"), overwrought metaphors ("slow dance of celestial bodies" used twice), and some purple passages ("pine sap and moonlight"). The filter verb "he understood" and "he thought of" could be more immediate. Template cadence in "He + verb" constructions through middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of genuine beauty ("walls smooth as glass, catching the light") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in peak beats. Several instances of abstract philosophizing ("the space between what was and what could be") and some repetitive phrasing around patterns and equations reduce momentum. The ending particularly accumulates abstract concepts rather than maintaining concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong sensory specificity. However, several template constructions appear ("Elias had spent a lifetime trying," "He wanted to know...but more than that") and some abstract phrasing ("weight of legacy," "burden of legacy") that could be more concrete. The repetition of "legacy" without variation shows minor synonym avoidance issues.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("elusive mirage painter, though no one called her that to her face"). The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks, but occasional overwriting appears ("dusky harmony," "ghost of a song") without full pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing that slow momentum: "the quiet violence of hope," "the slow, flawed beauty of choosing." Some repetitive structures ("Somewhere, a war was ending. Somewhere else, another would start") work as pattern but occasionally feel templated. Information density is good but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("The salt flat stretched like a wound") but suffers from paraphrase loops ("The egg would not hatch. / The bird was gone.") and template cadence in reflection passages. Filter constructions cluster in the final third ("he would pause," "he would press"), and some metaphors edge toward the overwrought ("thunder swallowed his footsteps whole").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm in places ("sigh and smile," "sharp and bright as shards") but several instances of overwriting dilute momentum. Mixed metaphors appear ("body a living poem," "vessel," "bones") without clear progression. Template cadence emerges in the echo sequence ("One by one...She let them..."), and abstract phrases like "quiet, relentless work" lack specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative control with purposeful imagery (dome as "permanent sigh," shadows "unspooled like silk") that serves thematic pressure. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("half-lit epiphanies," "ethical storytelling") that could be more embodied, and some repetitive constructions around "the way" that create minor template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves lyric density with lines doing multiple jobs: "its walls draped in moss so thick it swallowed sound" establishes setting, atmosphere, and isolation simultaneously. Some paraphrase loops appear ("The migration was over, but the remembering wasn't" echoes earlier sentiment). Template cadence in final section with repeated "The [noun] remembered" structure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose varies between crystalline moments and overwritten passages. Mixed metaphors appear ("rope's strands were time itself" becomes "sleeping serpent"), and abstract language ("transcribed into the sanctum's bones") occasionally obscures concrete action. The extended ending creates momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong propulsion and varied syntax, though some metaphorical density in early paragraphs ("swallowing its own echoes," "ghost of machine oil") slightly slows momentum. The final sequence accelerates cleanly with shorter, more direct sentences that match the urgency of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of elevated diction that creates distance ("empirically ironic thrill," "frugal rhythm"). Some repetitive structures in the middle section ("For three nights...," "On the fourth night..."). The closing achieves strong resonance despite these minor frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("cylinder pin snapped like a wish denied"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "Lior [verb]" constructions. Some abstract phrasing ("cellular memory") but it coheres with the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision: "frost clung to the gnarled trees like shattered glass." Information density is high—most sentences advance both external and internal transformation. Some metaphorical density in places ("fog thick enough to muffle even memory") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor repetition of "boundaries" could be varied.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some overwriting appears ("apple boughs sagged with fruit so ripe it smelled like forgiveness"). Template cadence emerges in the final section with repeated "The [noun]" openings. Information density is high and most lines do multiple jobs, but figurative density in places obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The past is a palimpsest; scratch deep enough"). Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor repetitive structures in the blossom revelation sequence and some filter verb clustering ("Veyra exhaled," "Veyra smiled") reduce immediacy in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shelves carved into the stone like the ribs of some slumbering titan"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("symphony of silence" cluster). Minor template cadence in "Elias had..." constructions. Information density high but occasionally purple.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some metaphorical density in high-pressure moments ("unkindled solace had festered all these years—a hollow where her heart should have been") creates mild opacity. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Minor template cadence in the final section with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "books bound in materials that didn't exist: pages of frozen breath." However, several instances of elevated diction ("syncopated to accommodate," "negotiating with confusion") and mild redundancy in the rope-weaving sequence prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied rhythm. Information density is solid—most lines advance multiple purposes. Several instances of abstract phrasing ("library," "preservation," "conversation") that could be more concrete. Minor repetition of "bloom of hush" without sufficient variation. The "smiled" beat feels slightly stock. Strong closing sequence from "Eldrin exhaled" onward with good propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance both external action and internal revelation simultaneously. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("thistle-blown moment") approaches overwriting but remains coherent. Minor template cadence in the final sequence ("Tomorrow, she'd...Tomorrow, she'd...") and slight paraphrase loop between "the pavilion's song fading behind her, but not gone. Never gone." costs precision.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "The door closed behind her with the sigh of a held breath released." Some overwriting in figurative density—"stormlit panes," "rain's afterecho," "bleeding shadow" cluster without pattern-teaching. Minor scaffold in repeated "She had spent" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and strong imagery, though some passages edge toward overwriting: "vines of liquid fire," "net of silver threads, trembling back into existence." Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. The chant evolution from "Sparks rise, though the sky forgets" to "Up, though the dark says stay" shows purposeful patterning without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments of compression and imagery, particularly "moonlight pooled like spilled ink" and the water drop "like a pinprick through fabric." However, several abstract passages dilute momentum: "the truth was too vast for the shape of his question," "transitions were never truly over, only layered." Some filter constructions ("she knew," "she understood") reduce immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("safety was just another word for shrank"). Vivid specificity in "melted steeple," "threads writhing like embers." Some figurative density in peak beats ("wine" for silence, multiple taste metaphors) but pattern is taught early. Minor template echo in "They learned/They began/They pressed" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("adjusted the brass dial on his wrist, monitoring noise levels not to measure sound, but to map its absence"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("angles too sharp for grief, too soft for resolve") and repetitive "somewhere" construction in closing. Template cadence appears briefly but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bleeding into dawn," "spiral stair that vanished into the clouds") and the abstract "age of choosing" construction that reads as scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, some overwriting appears ("the kind that clung to skin long after the ritual ended") and occasional template patterns emerge ("Lior didn't move" / "Lior exhaled" / "Lior reached"). The metaphorical density in places like "bridges burned" risks cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the farm's air thickened, the mushrooms brightening until their light cast long, wavering shadows"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("shadowseam and shimmering") but serves accumulative design. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" patterns mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("resonance between standing waves of thought and unspoken truths"). Some repetitive constructions around "Elias + verb" patterns in middle section. The closing sequence from "Elias smiled" onward achieves strong propulsion and density.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong figurative language mostly avoids excess, though occasional density borders on overwriting ("threads of gold and rot, weaving between..."). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some minor register elevation ("murmured allegiance," "sigils") but consistent with the gothic-fantasy voice. The final image crystallizes without explanation, trusting the accumulated patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information density high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Some filter verb clustering ("he thought," "he imagined") in middle section slightly dulls immediacy. Rhythm varies naturally between longer reflective sentences and shorter declarative moments. The prose avoids loops but occasionally leans on abstraction ("forgotten lives pressed too hard").

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the receiver dangling like a broken promise"), but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("She wasn't a fighter"/"She wasn't a hero" repetition; multiple "somewhere, a phone was ringing" iterations). Template cadence appears in the epilogue section with repeated "would [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops appear ("Only played. / Only hushed. / Only held") and template cadence runs ("He played on. / The mist listened."). Figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity in high-pressure beats ("the warp of light through wet glass, the shiver of a memory half-remembered"). The prose maintains momentum but suffers from −0.6 for template patterns and −0.4 for density issues in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation and purposeful imagery, though occasional density issues appear ("floating islands, each one a fragment of a world that had been or would be"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections ("She prodded," "She tucked," "She knelt") reduces immediacy. Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with varied sentence structures, though several passages contain abstract philosophizing that slows momentum ("uncertainty had become his closest companion"). Mixed metaphors appear ("tuning fork struck against fate," "black as a held breath"). The ending sequences achieve strong propulsion but middle sections contain scaffold phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong verb choices ("guttered," "scorched," "gilded"). Information density high in key passages. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("carry the weight differently"/"learned to carry it") and the extended denouement creates mild momentum drag after the primary closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythm variation and information density in lines like "He hadn't wept. He'd laughed." Template cadence appears in the "Liora didn't..." repetitions (didn't startle/didn't ask), though used purposefully for character establishment. Mixed metaphor slightly strains in "fabric of their endings" combined with musical motifs throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density and varied syntax, but "something like sap, something like blood" construction appears twice; mild template cadence in "The forest remembered too. / Its roots coiled..." sequence. Final third maintains clean propulsion with high specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several passages suffer from abstraction loops ("Some histories aren't overlooked...They're held") and conceptual redundancy about anchors/returning that dulls momentum. The phrase "elusively tangible" appears forced rather than organic. However, key moments like discovering Elara's name maintain clarity, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The ghosts went still" simultaneously marks supernatural presence, builds tension, and signals the mechanism's power. Minor figurative excess appears in "dead stars" for falling bolts and occasional elevated diction ("unspooling of shadows"), but prose maintains strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean, propulsive prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Vivid imagery like "books bound in frost and memory" and "liquid time, siphoned from moments." Minor deductions for abstract phrasing ("reality had become negotiable") and slight repetition in the dissolution sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in the opening paragraph's world-building. Some metaphorical density in places ("tangled, glowing web, draping the asteroid in strands thick as rope") but it serves the accumulative texture. Clean grammar and varied syntax throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "cold as a grave-marker, pulsing faintly like a dying ember" establishes temperature, death-association, and fading vitality. Some figurative density in peak beats ("harmonic tug like a fishhook") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "water rushed upward in a reverse waterfall." Minor template cadence in repeated "He [verb]" constructions and slight register drift in philosophical passages, but no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("turbine-hum filled his skull") and slight metaphor density in peak moments. The "sideways light threading through storm like golden stitches" risks purple prose but mostly lands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "glass shivered" and "light bleeding through the paper like a wound" demonstrate precise imagery, but repetitive structures proliferate in the ending: "The postcards would stay. / The murals would fade. / But the hush would remain." Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The world was quiet. / And in that quiet, everything made sense" essentially restates the same idea. The final third contains excessive one-line paragraphs that fragment momentum, and phrases like "earth and possibility" lean toward abstract poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm create momentum, particularly in vision sequences and the final release. Some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("neutrality was a lie," "weight of what was"), and occasional overwriting appears ("salt-stung air of a beach that no longer existed"), but information density remains high and no significant loops appear.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure, particularly in the sensory cascade sequence. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some metaphorical density in middle sections ("crucible," "vessel," "blueprints") clusters without full payoff. Template phrase "It was/wasn't" appears three times, creating minor cadence repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("thin as a whisper, brittle as old bone" conveys both physical state and temporal weight). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly exceeds necessity ("liminal space," "latent truths") though these fit the oath scribe's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("ice shattered upward in jagged teeth") but suffers from occasional abstraction ("texture of borrowed time") and filter constructions ("Liora knew," "She had discovered"). The rhythm effectively accelerates during the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs: "his calloused fingers tracing the stone where generations of testers had worn the edges smooth." Some repetitive phrasing appears ("Elias called it," "The abbot would") and occasional overwriting ("restless sea" for clouds). Information propels consistently toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several strong images ("fractured light over his calloused hands") compete with repetitive abstract phrasing about stillness, beginnings, and flourishing. The final section particularly suffers from conceptual loops ("The end was never the point. The point was...") and template cadence that dulls momentum rather than building to resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("skeletal frames of wooden hives jutting from the sand like the ribs of buried giants"). Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere, stakes, or meaning. Some figurative density in places ("whispers not sounds but pressures") and occasional abstract phrasing ("the weight of unspoken things") prevent higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some figurative density in peak beats ("split open like an overripe fruit") and occasional template structures ("He'd found it," "He climbed," "He understood") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with good information density and varied rhythm. Some overwriting appears ("iridescent as oil on water," "warm, attentive silence") and occasional abstraction ("beauty wasn't a thing you seized"). Template cadence briefly appears ("He believed... He was weaving... He pressed"). These artifacts don't touch closure but prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("joints to brittle hinges," "pillars breathed"). Some figurative density in opening that doesn't fully pay off ("breathed" metaphor). Minor scaffold in repeated "copper wire" phrasings without variation. Information density good but occasional redundancy in describing the symbiotic system.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation, though some abstract constructions weaken precision ("what if the universe wasn't indifferent?"). Minor redundancies appear ("The tower knew. And the stars. Always, the stars.") and occasional overwriting ("voice like rain on bronze") without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("his boots caked with salt and the fine silt of drowned things" establishes both action and atmosphere). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("submerged concord," "green vengeance") but rhythm varies naturally and figurative language serves the Gothic-ecological tone without overwhelming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and selective detail, with effective rhythm in peak moments. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered metaphor density that occasionally obscures clarity ("sky bled into the land in a tinted revelation") and minor template cadence in the closing sequence ("The dome hummed. The vines tightened.").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the shorter fragments building tension ("Her pulse quickened"). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing that loses clarity ("through the void, through the years"), some filter-verb clustering ("she realized," "she felt"), and the vague "somewhere else" construction that softens precision at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery like "where the sun bled violet and the stars moved like schools of fish" creates atmosphere. However, abstract phrases accumulate ("apprentice of wonder," "embrace the unknown," "the next wonder") without sufficient grounding. Some figurative language feels forced ("laugh was the sound of cracking ice") and the ending repetition of "And the next" creates unnecessary padding.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("wings...fragile as moths, each bearing the weight of a stolen gesture"). Some abstract passages lack concrete grounding, and occasional synonym loops ("benevolently ruthless"/"benevolent, ruthless"). The pattern-taught walking-as-writing device adds propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose rhythm with varied sentence lengths creating momentum, particularly in discovery sequences. However, several paraphrase loops weaken density: "The stone wasn't lost; it was hiding" followed immediately by explanation; "The stone wasn't a key. It was a mirror" using identical structure. Some filter-verb clustering in memory sequences ("He saw himself," "He understood") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful repetition of key images. Deductions for abstract phrases ("fierce repose," "quiet alchemy") and some overwriting in figurative language ("thunder's lull deepened, no longer distant but inside him"). The ending sequence maintains momentum despite these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The towers were not built; they were grown, fed by the sins of the contrite, their marrow thick with confessions never spoken aloud." Some metaphorical density in early passages ("needle drawing thread from the sky") could be tighter, but the climactic sequence maintains clean propulsion. Information unfolds without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful fragments at climax. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some elevated diction ("soul of the world," "edge of oblivion") occasionally strains but doesn't obscure closure. The final sequence's staccato rhythm effectively heightens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("jagged shadows like broken teeth," "the sound like waves retreating"). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("Elias knelt... Elias exhaled... Elias paused").

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative control with purposeful density—metaphors cohere around communication/resonance. Information density high, most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some filter-verb accumulation ("Elias knew," "he watched," "he didn't wonder") slightly dulls immediacy in middle section. Syntax varies effectively, supporting rhythm shifts between reflection and action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful repetition ("She hadn't always been," "Now, she built"). Some figurative density in places ("breathing patina," "divining rod," "ship of its own") but serves the accumulative design. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" patterns costs precision.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The virus had stripped the world of artful deception, but it had also unspooled the threads of trust"). Some metaphoric density in opening passages ("broken chandelier," "saint's relic") without full payoff, and occasional filter constructions ("Lior's breath fogged") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with evocative imagery, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("the weight of something unsaid," "temporary vessel") and mild redundancy in the memory-exploration sequence. The filter verb "understood" disrupts immediacy in a key beat. Information density could be higher in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The creek had swollen overnight, its murmur now a low, insistent growl") and zero paraphrase loops. Rhythmic variation between short declarations ("He wasn't here for the maps") and flowing descriptive passages creates natural propulsion without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Some overwriting in places ("smoldering veins where the rock itself seemed to breathe") and occasional abstract constructions. The "thing that had been a queen" construction feels slightly workshop-worn. Information density is high but occasionally tips toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, but figurative density in high-pressure beats occasionally obscures ("splitting open like a fruit, its juice the density"). Template cadence appears in final section ("The shell had done its work. Now it was theirs to do the rest."). Some paraphrase loops around the extraction/offering concept reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The cabin held its breath"). Some figurative density in opening third but serves accumulative pattern. Clean propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful fragments. Minor repetition of "Elias" could be trimmed but doesn't harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"fog curled through the alley like breath on glass" establishes setting, atmosphere, and metaphoric register. Sentence variety and rhythm support scene momentum. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("ordinary miracles," "emotional terrain") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of striking clarity ("letting the stone drink the rune") but suffers from some abstract phrasing ("stories taking shape in the air between her hands") and mild repetition of storm/breath imagery. Information density is generally strong with most lines advancing multiple purposes. Some filter constructions ("She understood then") could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful metaphorical density that serves the accumulative structure. Information density is high—most sentences advance both literal and thematic layers. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("gossip-column exorcist") lacking immediate clarity and some repetitive stems in the emotional peak section ("Elias..." constructions), though overall momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("the temple's hollow silence, where dust motes hung like suspended stars"). Some abstract terminology creates opacity ("spiral arbitration," "cosmic illusions"). Template cadence appears in middle section with repeated "He [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the countdown sequences. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some figurative language edges toward oversaturation ("pendulum swinging wide as a scythe," "split the horizon like a needle through silk") and the "razor edges" metaphor risks overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The doctors called it a failure of monitoring. Lena called it a failure of imagination"). Minor template cadence in "She was here because" construction and occasional abstract phrasing ("the physics of letting go") without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density high in opening paragraphs. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("theoretically rebellious energy") and some filter-verb clustering in middle sections ("she'd followed," "she'd ended up"). The "clover-melancholy" compound reads slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variety and information density, with lines like "wrong numbers were the only kind that ever called" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("liquid constellation," "fragile thread") but generally serves the accumulative mode. Minor template cadence in the "About the..." paragraph structure mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("twilight bled into the harbor" sets time, mood, and mirrors ink-staining). Some mild repetition in the ending sequence ("like a relic, like a weapon, like a gift") serves rhythm but borders on overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong images like "swallowing its own echoes." Some abstract phrasing ("the real, gnawing absence") and occasional overwriting ("hollow out," "forger, a poet, and...the last person") create minor density issues. The closing sequence maintains good momentum despite these occasional indulgences.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "languages he could taste" and "the space between a held breath and its release." Deductions for repetitive "He [verb]" structures in the final third and some abstract phrasing ("uncharted depths," "quiet fire"). Information density is high but occasional redundancy appears in the ending sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("ink inside had ever been real or if it, too, had been edited out of history"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the contingent relationships concept is restated without advancement, and "wrong seeds" cycles through multiple iterations. Template cadence in "He understood...He had spent...He uncapped" sequence. These artifacts don't touch closure but accumulate in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "waves lapping at the docks like a lullaby no one remembered how to sing" establishes setting, loss, and tone simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("blade wrapped in velvet," "heart full of names") creates slight coherence friction. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks maintain momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose occasionally strains with elevated diction ("volcanic tenderness erupting in his chest") and some abstract phrasing. Information density is generally strong but phrases like "the weight of unspoken vows" and "another ghost the desert wouldn't remember" tend toward the ornamental. Line-level craft supports the story without major impediment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("crystalline reeds bending under the weight of frequencies"). Minor template cadence in the "She called it" repetition and occasional abstract phrasing ("vault of auroral sorrow"). The closing sequence maintains clarity and momentum effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong syntactic variety and information density, particularly in opening descriptions. Some template cadence appears mid-story ("He stepped forward... He let his walk..."). The final section achieves excellent rhythm modulation. Minor filter verb clustering around perception doesn't significantly harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting: "shadows pooled between the boats like forgotten promises" and "spiralingly calm" feel ornamental. The extended coda after the natural ending dilutes momentum, though line-level clarity remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("library stood like a bruise in the mist"). However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("forests of second thoughts," "ideas waiting to be remembered") and template repetition in the window display sequence. The "sang" moment of magnetic resistance is precise and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vivid concrete imagery ("whalebone carving," "ribs ached to expand") with good momentum, but figurative density clusters heavily ("thick as regret," "heavier than crates," "impatient lover" in quick succession). Template structure appears in parallel "He didn't [X] / He [Y]" constructions and some abstract philosophy interrupts scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments like "curls of wood falling like shed skin" but suffers from some overwriting ("mechanical mourning," "tangled into something unnameable"). Several filter constructions ("she recognized," "which was as close as") dull immediacy. The paraphrase of theme in "easier to carry grief when your hands are busy" edges toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "gates finally groaned open" and "frost-kissed stone," but several instances of abstract phrasing ("edges dissolving," "something fluid and flickering") and mild repetition of dissolution imagery reduce precision. The "She had" constructions create some scaffold that could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for abstract labeling in high-pressure moments ("Beginning," "made sense"), some repetitive phrasing around plant arrangements, and occasional register drift ("undeniable pressure"). Information density is good but inconsistent.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose suffers from template cadence in several passages ("She had come... She was... She would...") and abstract phrasing like "texture of connection" that recurs without added pressure. The filter-verb stack in "Liora knew the truth" and similar constructions dulls immediacy, though the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition (folding, leaving, illuminating). Information density high in discovery sequence. Some overwriting in metaphorical sections ("shadows...were not of wings, but of vines") and occasional abstract phrasing ("grief...was a stencil, a coordinate"). Template cadence in "She + verb" constructions through middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, with the brass tape tip "clicking like a metronome counting down" providing sonic texture. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of elevated register ("metastasized into a cult," "inherited mystery") create mild coherence friction, and the repetition of "Elias [verb]" patterns in the final third approaches template cadence without quite crossing into penalty territory.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("Fear was just another pattern") but suffers from abstract loops ("atoms of nostalgia" appears twice without evolution) and occasional overwriting. The closing sequence from "carried nothing but the weight" onward feels slightly padded with multiple endings.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("The library floated above the clouds like a forgotten promise") with good rhythmic variation, but suffers from occasional template cadence ("She would tell it like this," "The curator would record it") and some paraphrase loops around the shadow concept. Information density is generally strong with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("fragile conviction," "weight of the stars") and near-repetition of conceptual language around layers/shedding prevent higher scoring. The filter verb "he thought of" and similar constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("sand hissed onto the sill, counting down to something") without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("She turned...She pressed...She was"). No major loops but occasional abstract phrasing dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong figurative coherence ("thief of echoes," "labyrinth of time") with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph lengths. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("shape of a song waiting to be remembered") and some repetitive constructions around "where" that create mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Time here didn't bend—it *unraveled*"). However, some paraphrase loops appear ("The whispers grew clearer now, not just words but *shapes*" followed by redundant examples). Template cadence in places ("She returned... Her paintings... Her music...") dulls momentum in the denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("skeletal ribbon of steel," "petals of light unfurling"), but some overwriting appears in peak moments ("sound that wasn't sound but vibration"). Minor redundancy in explaining concepts (archive passages) and occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match Hollow's working-class origins reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for abstract philosophical passages that occasionally drift into elevated register ("the quiet, electric thrill of a sixth sense waking up") and some repetitive stems in the final third ("Not when..." pattern). Information density high in opening and closing thirds.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("lantern swinging like a metronome") and rhythm variation supports the meditative pace. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("twilight deepening like a held note"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and minor redundancy in the threshold/crossing imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "seraphically mundane in its imperfection" and "the color of a bruise just before it fades" show control. However, abstract phrases like "the effort of remaining" and "a tuneless, frostbitten hope of a sound" lean toward ornamental. Some paraphrase loops around silence/sound concepts in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagery and varied syntax create momentum, particularly in the climactic sequence. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional redundancy ("quiet authority"/"unpretentious" overlap) and two instances of abstract telling that could be more embodied ("gracefully, as all things must").

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful repetition of key phrases. Some figurative language verges on overwriting ("the ink had bled into nothing—no names, no borders, just the ghost of a shoreline"), and abstract formulations occasionally slow the beat ("Some paths didn't disappear. They just needed the right hands to call them back").

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density is high with purposeful figurative language, though some metaphors strain ("war drum made of stars"). Template cadence appears in "She + verb" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The paraphrase loop of "remembered/remembering" in the final section dulls momentum, and "meaning wasn't found...but in" reads as explicit thematic statement rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("veins of light, pulsing faintly") but suffers from occasional abstraction ("a destiny implanted before her grandmother's grandmother was born") and repetitive constructions around plant communication. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others loop conceptually. The final image lands cleanly without overexplanation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("henna still wet on her hands, the drone a speck in the sky no one had noticed yet") but suffers from occasional abstract elevation ("something heavier—something like roots") and repetitive structure in the philosophical passages. The italicized therapy-speak (*embodied pause*, *You don't have to let go. You have to make room.*) creates mild register friction. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others loop conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong imagistic prose with purposeful compression and varied syntax, but "luminescent ache" appears three times creating mild repetition. Some abstract phrases like "necessary dark" and occasional filter constructions ("she needed to descend") slightly reduce immediacy. Information density generally high with most lines serving multiple purposes.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful fragments ("No body. No blood."). Information density stays high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor repetitive structures appear ("He had been tracking," "He'd vanished," "He would follow") but don't significantly impede flow.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in opening passages. Some figurative language clusters densely ("breath held before a scream," "cathedral of secrets," "hooked her like a barb") without full payoff. Minor template cadence appears in final rapid-fire declarations ("The snow kept falling. The library kept breathing.") but overall momentum sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of compression ("The tower was dust. The roses were not.") but filter-verb stacks appear in pressure beats ("She pressed," "She traced," "She tore"). Template cadence runs in middle sections with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across 4-5 consecutive sentences diminish momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments of compression ("The garden screamed—a sound only he could hear") and varied sentence lengths create effective rhythm, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("The kind that lasted. / The kind that didn't echo."). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, but occasional abstract phrasing ("when patterns break themselves") and slight repetition in the final section prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with effective variation ("The observatory hummed with the weight of silence" vs. short declaratives like "Her stomach twisted"), though some metaphor extensions feel slightly overwrought ("Regret was an orbit...you could trace its path forever"). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagery and rhythm in places but marred by overwriting in peak beats. "The firmware roots burrowing deeper into the cracks of her mind" and similar metaphors accumulate without clear vehicle consistency. Some paraphrase loops around the guilt/debt concept. Information density generally high but occasionally sacrifices clarity for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong moments like "The mist coiled through the grotto like a held breath" and varied sentence structures maintain momentum. Some repetitive stems ("He didn't..." appears multiple times) and occasional overwriting ("emergent hush" feels forced) prevent higher scoring. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful fragments. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. However, some metaphoric density in peak beats ("dying prayer," "skeletal," "heretic's compassion" in quick succession) and occasional template cadence ("He began with... He moved to...") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong sentence variety and rhythmic control, particularly in the vision sequence's accumulative syntax. Information density high—most lines advance multiple layers. Some minor repetition of "the orchard" and occasional abstract phrasing ("what came next") but these don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The studio smelled of ozone and burnt sugar" establishes setting, aftermath, and tone. Rhythm varies naturally between short declaratives ("Lena smiled") and complex observations. Some figurative density in peak beats ("veins of light pulsing in rhythms") but serves the accumulative design. Minor filter-verb clustering around "she understood, then.">

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("caves exhaled salt and damp," "fossil lifted from their palm, suspended in charged air"). Template cadence appears in mid-section ("Lior understood. The caves weren't just transitional. They were waiting.") creating minor drumbeat. Some abstract phrasing ("voice to the silences") reduces density but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("His fingers, calloused from years of twisting glass, brushed over jars"). Some figurative excess appears ("slithered free," "curling into stale air") but serves atmospheric accumulation. Minor template patterns in mid-section ("Elias exhaled" followed by exposition) slightly dampen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The wind on Zephyr Bluff carried no name"). However, several instances of overwriting: "skeletal remains of a cedar" could be "skeletal cedar"; some metaphors strain ("fields still stiff with the tilt of the earth"). Minor paraphrase loop with "Let the wind take it. / Let the thaw erase the rest." Information density is good but uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, though "spindrift serenity" feels elevated beyond the established register. Some filter-verb clustering ("he understood," "she'd said") in the middle section dulls immediacy. The prose generally maintains momentum with varied sentence lengths matching the story's patient-then-urgent rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the glass "thrummed faintly against his palm, a vibration not of sound but of memory"). Some elevated diction in peak beats ("sharp gentleness of the dying light") but it serves the piece's lyric mode. Minor repetition of "thrum" (4x) and "fractures" (3x) but purposeful. Clean grammar and varied paragraph structure support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language occasionally tips toward density ("luminous harbor air," "silvering the water like a blade") without always advancing pressure. Some paraphrase loops appear ("quivering hush"/"tremor in her hands"), though the prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the sundial as timekeeper/mirror/shield), though some repetitive constructions appear ("Lior had spent," "Lior had learned," "Lior exhaled"). The prose achieves memorable specificity in phrases like "bones groaning like old ship timber" and "Morse code of extinction," but filter verb clusters in the middle section reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("casting a shadow shaped like a thrush in flight"). Information density is generally high, though some passages loop conceptually ("secrets, she believed, were not meant to be buried—they were meant to be rejoined"). Minor register drift appears in abstract passages that don't match Liora's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative language ("static hissed...like a nest of angry stars," "threading through the noise like a needle pulling string") enhances without overwhelming. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor repetitive structures ("She'd been called...She'd spent...") and occasional abstraction ("testing them, prodding at the cracks") prevent higher scoring. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the slow weep of centuries" establishes age, atmosphere, and wrongness simultaneously) and varied syntax that accelerates during the chamber transformation sequence. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("the mutiny of space," "starved god") occasionally drifts from the established register but doesn't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density serves atmosphere but occasionally tips toward overwriting - "the mist curled like a held breath" and similar figurative language appears frequently. Some filter constructions ("Elias had always known the truth") dull immediacy. However, syntactic variety and information density remain strong, with the lance sequence showing excellent propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Minor redundancies appear ("hollow" voice after stating "the Maw's gone" already conveys emptiness) and occasional overwriting in metaphors, but momentum sustains through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though abstract constructions like "sculpted from the ashes of 'never'" appear multiple times without adding precision. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere and meaning simultaneously. The final sequence maintains momentum despite the surreal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is strong—most sentences carry multiple functions, as in the startup boom paragraph that simultaneously establishes time, place, and thematic contrast. Some figurative density in non-peak moments ("glass skeletons glinting... like the ribs of something starved") and minor repetition of "foreign money" create slight drag without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The observatory's clock struck the hour when understanding dawns"). Minor redundancies appear ("closed his eyes"/"slept without dreaming" proximity) and occasional overwriting ("bleeding into waking life"). Information density remains high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the weight of knowing pressing him flatter than any blade could"), but parenthetical asides create momentum drag and some metaphors strain ("wound" lake, "hungry" roots). Template structures appear in the ending sequence ("Some things...Some things...") though they create intentional rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("each step syncing with the throb of her scars") but suffers from occasional overwriting—"the promise that had been swallowed by time's greedy mouth" feels strained. Template cadence appears in the "She had spent years... Tonight, the glade... Her purposefully curious hands" sequence, though information density remains generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of compression ("roots twisting like veins through the ribs of the forgotten") but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "holes in her soul"/"patch the holes"/"gaps to fill" recycles the same concept. Template cadence appears in the ending ("Somewhere, a root split another bone. / Somewhere, a new trade began.") though it creates intentional rhythm. Information density varies, with some lines doing multiple jobs while others merely restate.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong rhythm variation and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Some figurative excess in the middle section ("dust motes...like raised lighters," "wound in the earth," "flickering bulb") creates slight density friction. The driving sequence recovers momentum with cleaner, more propulsive syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("the fingers of a god testing the weight of mortality") but occasionally overreaches with density—three metaphors stack in the spirit's description alone. Some transitions feel abrupt (the two-day climb compressed to one line), though momentum generally holds.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information-dense prose with strong imagery, though occasionally overwrought ("liquid opals," "lullaby of both/and"). Some abstract phrasing ("wonder survived routine") and mild redundancy in thematic statements. The filter verb "saw" in "Elias saw his own face" could be cut for immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but occasional overwriting ("electric air," "resonant hush," "hungry, still waiting") and some template phrasing ("She understood then," "She didn't answer. Instead, she began"). The metaphorical density in places like "womb, waiting for someone brave enough" approaches purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the fog had started to feel like a second skin"). Some register drift in phrases like "daringly methodical" and "alluding to the truth." Two instances of mild paraphrase loops ("The river had dried; the maps lied" followed by conceptually similar content).

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong opening and closing lines with varied syntax and purposeful compression. Information density high in key beats. Some metaphorical density in places ("curling like ink," "velvet unspooling") and occasional template structures ("She had to move faster") but generally clean propulsion. Minor repetition of "mist" without always advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from POV lexicon ("perforated by choices not yet made"). Minor paraphrase loop around the propagation concept in paragraphs 5-6. The final image lands with strong specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths that support the meditative pace. Information density is high—most sentences advance both atmosphere and plot. Some elevated diction ("radiance on the other side of silence") occasionally tips toward overwriting but generally serves the piece's otherworldly register. Minor repetition of "threshold" concept could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation and high information density. However, some figurative density in mystical sections borders on opacity ("spiral, not a wound but a cradle"). Template structure in "She had climbed... She had forgiven..." creates minor cadence issue.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "doubt crept in like fog"/"wore their doubts like a cloak," repeated certainty/uncertainty abstractions. Strong moments of compression ("The woman stayed. The shard stayed hollow.") offset by occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages. Line-level craft solid but template phrases around light/dark and knowing/unknowing reduce freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures that support the meditative rhythm. However, some figurative density in non-pattern moments ("spine straight as a sycamore," "fingers...like roots") and minor template repetition in "Elias had"/"He was" constructions. The ripple pattern descriptions effectively do multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during tension. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bruised twilight," "slithered through hollows") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "pulse" concept without sufficient variation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("storm-wracked sky," "wreathed in frostbloom") but serves the fantastical register. The final image of the candle roaring "Louder" against automated hymns lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines like "shelves sagged under books swollen with seawater, their pages fused into brittle sculptures" doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition in "Elias understood then" and some filter constructions ("he found," "he stood") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The coins weren't currency but keys"). Deductions for abstract philosophical passages that slow momentum ("chasing the illusion of forward momentum"), some filter-verb clustering in the middle section, and occasional overwriting ("the negative space between vibrations"). The final sequence recovers with sharp, propulsive fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The reaper wasn't supposed to remember. But he did." Information flows cleanly without loops. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("formless dreads") but the crystallization sequence shows exceptional control.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, with standout lines like "The bell didn't hum. It *wept*" creating effective emphasis. However, several template constructions appear ("Elias knew," "Elias thought," "Elias worked") and some metaphors strain credibility ("spine of frozen lightning" mixed with "stone veins pulsing"), preventing entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagistic precision in "church steeple broke the surface like a broken finger" and controlled rhythm throughout. However, abstract phrases like "the meaning they'd never let themselves share" and some template constructions ("One by one, he lit...") create minor momentum drags that don't quite reach the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("fractured rainbows," "kaleidoscopic waterfall," "living cipher" in quick succession). Some phrases edge toward template lyricism ("weight of what she was about to lose").

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Some passages achieve exceptional compression ("trust was a parachute you packed yourself"). However, abstract phrasing occasionally surfaces ("the burden of knowing," "faith of those who had no choice") and a few filter verb clusters reduce immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("storm-wracked valley," "tearing silk") but suffers from repetitive structures ("The dojo's wooden doors groaned open," "The dojo creaked," "The dojo rose higher") and some overwriting in metaphorical density. Filter constructions like "he felt the weight" and conceptual abstractions ("the weight of his own emotions") dull immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high and most lines advance multiple purposes, but several instances of overwriting detract: "beetle-shells under the brass lamp," "dried scorpion's heart," and "orthogonal thinking—sideways solutions" feels like unnecessary exposition. The fragmentary sentences create rhythm but occasionally feel mannered rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, though some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("symphony conducted by Elias"). Minor template cadence in middle sections ("He had tried...So he came here...") but recovers with varied syntax. The final sequence achieves excellent propulsion with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the walls between here and *there* had started to thin, like parchment left too long in the rain"). Sentence variety and rhythm support the dreamlike atmosphere. Some figurative density in places ("spiral eating itself," "ink in water," "roots reversing") but these serve the surreal tone. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the nexus's embers dimmed—not like a flame guttering, but like a lung pausing mid-breath"). However, figurative density in peak beats without full payoff (-0.5), some elevated diction clashing with urgency ("successive approximation toward something alive"), and occasional overwrought metaphors ("light filtered through bruised skin") accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or concept simultaneously. Some abstract phrasing ("the kind that lived in the pause between a held breath and a scream") occasionally slows momentum, and "serenely electric" appears three times.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong propulsion and varied syntax, particularly in action sequences. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting: "cut through the black water like a blade through silk" (stock simile), some figurative density in crisis moments, and minor template cadence in the listing sequence ("the laugh of a child... the last breath").

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. Some elevated diction ("sinew thread coiled," "fractal with shifting depths") works within the surreal context. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing and two instances of near-paraphrase ("beautiful"/"again?" sequence could be compressed).

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("somber marvel of a civilization"). Strong moments like "the way it caught the bioluminescent glow...like a key waiting to be turned." Repetition of "unfolded" becomes slightly mechanical. Some filter constructions ("she realized") in the final section reduce impact.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong opening with "mist curled around Elias's ankles" and resonant closing "He answered." Some figurative density in peak beats ("thin as spider silk," "stitching together") without becoming purple. Deductions for repetitive "He was/wasn't" constructions and slight template cadence in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density through selective detail and varied rhythm, particularly in passages like "a ripple, not in the air, but in the *absence* of it." However, several template constructions appear ("He hadn't come to steal. / He'd come to stand"), and the final section contains repetitive short declaratives that create drumbeat cadence ("The tide returned. / The cables slept."). Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but occasionally tips into overwriting: "coiled around her, not through sound but through the ink bleeding" feels strained. Strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some metaphor mixing around the ink's behavior weakens clarity in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments like "copper-veined storyteller" and "flawed diamond at her throat" demonstrate purposeful compression. However, several paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "translate it all, even the untranslatable" restates without advancement, and the ending cycles through multiple variations of absence. The filter-heavy sequence "She tried to run...turned to ice" dulls immediacy at a crucial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dense, atmospheric prose with strong moments ("the pines swayed, and the stars moved just a little slower") but overwriting issues: multiple false endings create loops, parenthetical asides accumulate unnecessarily, and figurative density in peak beats ("bitterness had become his religion") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong momentum with lines doing multiple jobs ("The statues didn't collapse. They *melted*"), though some elevated register drift appears ("benediction," "insistent pulse of rebirth"). Minor redundancy in the ending's multiple restatements of transformation reduces density, but the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Twilight bled violet," "letters collected like bruises"), but occasional density issues appear: "the echo of voices reading words that never arrived" borders on abstraction. Some filter constructions ("Elias knew better") could be more immediate, and the final paragraph contains mild redundancy in its triple assertion structure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with lines like "melody of sawdust and rust" but suffers from occasional overwriting ("ghostly under the moon," "thrown confetti") and some filter-verb clustering ("Lior stood," "He stepped," "She stopped"). Template cadence appears in "The mirrors rippled. The train groaned" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful density, though some abstract phrasing dilutes immediacy ("fleeting clarity," "liquid amber"). Minor template cadence in "He'd spent years collecting fragments" sequence and occasional overwriting ("the place where stories lived wasn't a shelf or a page, but the *curvature* between them") that reaches for profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The palette flared—once, twice—like a match in a hurricane" simultaneously shows action, suggests fragility, and mirrors the dream's dissolution. Some figurative density in places ("whispering archipelago still hummed with the hush") but pattern is taught early. Slight deduction for occasional abstract phrasing and one instance of paraphrase ("some stories weren't meant to be read" concept restated).

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments of crystalline prose ("her shop a sliver of lamplight beneath the first stars") demonstrate control, with varied sentence structures creating appropriate rhythm. Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple functions. However, abstract phrases like "the space between the strands, where the idea of freedom had been trapped, vibrating" and "the moment before a door chooses whether to open or stay shut forever" edge toward purple prose. Some paraphrase loops appear ("She recognized the sensation" followed by explanation).

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative moments like "black water," "jagged absence," and "waves dragging over glass." Information density is good with most sentences pulling double duty. Deductions for metaphor density in places ("drowned leviathan," "hollowed out like a gourd," "split like a wishbone") and slight repetition in memory-loss descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong images like "memories that had outlived their tellers" and the shadow "coiled like a spring." Some filter verbs ("she thought") and occasional redundancy ("deliberate slowness" could be just "deliberately"). The paraphrase of "reversible paths" after establishing the concept creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("fruit that glowed like captured sunsets"), though occasional abstraction ("insatiable craving to shape the unseen") and mild redundancy in the closing meditation on wonder. Some template phrasing in dialogue tags ("she whispered," "he said"). Information density is high in descriptive passages but thins during the extended philosophical conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("singing pressure of what had been set free"). Information unfolds through image and action rather than exposition. Some metaphoric density in peak beats borders on excess but remains coherent. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The vault smelled of damp stone and old secrets" establishes setting, tone, and theme). Some metaphoric density in peak beats ("marrow of her bones," "ribs thrumming") approaches oversaturation but remains coherent, and the rhythm varies naturally between short declaratives and flowing observations.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("brass reading lamps still cradled ghosts of light"). Minor template cadence in "She noted...She had spent...She had come" sequence. Information density high, particularly in the snow globe descriptions doing multiple jobs simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The courtyard floated above the clouds like a forgotten server room"). Some metaphor mixing occurs ("ghost in code" as "fragment" that later "unraveled") but doesn't obscure meaning. Minor scaffold appears in "The balladeer smiled, somewhere beyond the clouds" which tells rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages like "scattered light like broken promises." Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("hollow bones," "broken promises," "finger pointing") creates slight overwriting before settling into cleaner progression.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments of compression and imagery ("clouds weren't just water and wind. They were the breath of every life"). However, several paraphrase loops appear ("The empty spaces remembered" concept restated multiple times) and some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("quiet violence," "poetic desperation"). The ending sequence maintains momentum despite these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and high information density, but several overwriting issues: mixed metaphors ("library was a wound," "river of gold"), elevated diction that occasionally strains ("the sky wrote itself across their pages"). Some template patterns in the ending sequence. These don't touch closure directly but accumulate enough to limit the score.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves solid momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks marking scene shifts. Information density is generally strong, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("The crew cheered... but Liora stayed"). Minor template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" constructions, and the extended denouement after escape slightly dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments like "breath curled like old ink" and "clicks in a prophecy" show controlled lyricism. However, several abstract constructions weaken momentum: "labyrinth of glass and forgotten time," "shape of time's absence," and overuse of "something darker than rust—memories, maybe." The prose occasionally reaches for profundity at the expense of clarity, particularly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with lines often doing double work (description + atmosphere). Information density is high without feeling rushed. Minor template cadence appears in "She [verb]" patterns mid-story, and some figurative language borders on purple ("split the sky"), but clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagery and varied syntax, but "nested patterns" appears twice without clear definition, creating mild opacity. Some abstract phrasing ("membrane where time's final ripple thinned") risks comprehension. The closing sequence from "The lighthouse kept its secret" forward achieves excellent rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "impression" that builds meaning. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional paraphrase loops ("Someone had built the labyrinth to guide, not to trap" restates earlier material) and some filter-verb clusters that reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("symphony of erosion," "Fibonacci unfurling"). Minor paraphrase loops around dissolution/letting go concepts, but momentum sustains through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("a needle of black obsidian, honed to a point finer than a thought") but suffers from repetitive structural patterns in the closing third, particularly the string of single-line paragraphs that create predictable cadence. Some metaphorical density approaches oversaturation ("clouds churned like restless pages") without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments ("the moon bleed into the horizon") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("fossilized grief," "emotionally contagious"). Some filter constructions ("Elias thought he saw") and repetitive sentence openings ("He'd found," "He slid," "He knelt") create minor drag without compromising clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, several metaphorical flourishes border on overwriting ("baton cutting arcs through twilight like a scythe through wheat") and occasional register elevation ("celestial mechanism above them") doesn't fully integrate with the industrial setting.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and varied syntax, with effective information density in most passages. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("quantum foam of decision and regret," "fractured ribs under the moon's silver scalpel") and some conceptual redundancy ("abandoned dreams" appears twice). The final third maintains momentum despite these ornamental tendencies.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some elevated diction ("serpentine grotto," "bioluminescent and blue") occasionally feels overwrought but serves atmosphere. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor weakness in the slightly repetitive "seed" imagery in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "The porcelain insulator dangled from his belt, its glazed surface catching the pale dawn, a relic from the time before the wires went silent" establishes object, time, and world-state simultaneously. Some minor repetition ("the grove" appears frequently) but rhythm varies purposefully with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong rhythmic variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("jagged and luminous," "pregnant, thick") and one template cadence run in the middle section that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective variation in sentence length and structure. Information density is high in passages like the diary's catalog of silences. Some figurative excess: "shadows stretched long and thin" and "aftershocks of celebration" feel slightly overwrought. The paraphrase loop between "Maybe empathy wasn't just about hearing the quiet" and "Maybe it was about knowing when to break it" dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of elevated diction ("undercurrent that dragged truths to the surface like flotsam") and mild redundancy ("steady"/"stillness" cluster). The filter verb "knew" appears frequently without adding texture, though line-level craft supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery ("water tracing silver paths through the air") and good momentum. Some repetitive structures appear ("She [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs) and occasional abstract phrasing ("resilience wasn't something you found"). The "whirling silence" paradox works as taught pattern. Minor template cadence in the closing sequence reduces density.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong sensory specificity ("rust-streaked grates," "ink bleeding slightly in the damp air") with effective rhythm variation between technical observation and visceral action. Some repetitive sentence openings ("She adjusted," "She pulled," "She marked") create minor drag. The "bone not metal" moment lands with appropriate shock, and information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variation and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some abstract phrasing weakens momentum ("certify wonder as essential," "conversation—whispers of the earth's first song"). The opening and closing lines effectively bookend the transformation, though middle sections occasionally drift toward conceptual summary rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "frost-bitten earth where the last guardian's bones had settled into stone." Some overwriting appears ("avalanchingly quiet air," "unspooled his defenses") and mild repetition of "quiet/hush" weakens momentum without serving accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The fragment had fallen from the sky three nights prior"). However, some abstract loops around emotion and meaning dilute momentum ("Some absences were just space, waiting to be filled" follows similar abstraction). The filter-verb cluster in the ending sequence ("Elias inhaled... He pulled... Elias listened") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong image density, but several template patterns emerge: "The courier [verb]" repetitions, some paraphrase loops ("The hum was home" following similar sentiment). The fragmentary ending structure works purposefully but occasionally tips into repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong opening and closing lines that bookend with transformed meaning. Information density high in descriptive passages. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("terrible knowing," "awful clarity of understanding") and some repetitive structures ("Elias didn't believe... but he believed"). Filter verb cluster in middle section ("feeling," "watching," "seeing").

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers, but several paraphrase loops appear ("her bones woven into the roots, her name forgotten" restates dissolution). Template cadence emerges in parallel structures ("She did not weep. She had known the cost"). The "raveling silence" phrase recurs without always adding new meaning, creating mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fruit ripening in seconds, their skins splitting with sudden sweetness"), but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "The planet was awake now. / And so was he" restates without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the ending sequence ("The orchards would bear fruit. The arches would hold.").

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("weight of meaning"), some synonym repetition (shard/fragment/glass), and occasional overwriting ("ghost of machinery"). The paraphrase loop "She was the map now / And the map was endless" weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, though some figurative density borders on overwriting ("the ache of light that used to be," "salt pork," "teeth and salt").

Final image of walking "toward the village, her hands still warm" provides clean propulsion despite minor scaffolding elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong imagery and momentum with lines like "mist curled through the gaps, thick enough to mute the world below." Some figurative density in peak moments ("color and caution and the quiet explosion of being seen") and occasional abstract phrasing ("hollows that ached to be filled") create minor friction without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty—"moonlight pooled like liquid silver," "brass arms bent like a dying spider." Information density is high, with most sentences carrying multiple functions.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, particularly in the singing sequence where short, punchy sentences build momentum. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some abstract phrases ("realm that had forgotten how to wake," "promises deferred") lack concrete grounding. Minor loops appear in the repetition of "mirror world" concepts without added detail, and occasional elevated register ("exhalations," "cradle") creates slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Some figurative density in peak moments ("phantom limbs," "nest of contradictions") and minor paraphrase loops around the hiding theme reduce momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery. Information density high in descriptive passages. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She + verb" patterns). "Uncloaked" repetition works as purposeful pattern. Minor scaffolding in transition sentences between scenes reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts. Some overwriting in figurative density ("forgotten breath," "bleeding light," "frostbitten leather") and occasional abstract phrasing ("extraction: to conjure meaning"). Template cadence appears briefly ("He held...He adjusted...He worked") but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the tide had brought his boots back empty." However, template cadence appears in "She'd inherited...She'd gotten...She'd played" sequence, and some paraphrase loops exist ("made her peace with the breaking"/"didn't need to hear it again").

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("terrestrially cosmic," "the aurora's slow pulse"). Some template repetition ("Lira [verb]" patterns) and the extended ending slightly dilutes momentum, but the sensory specificity and rhythmic control during transformation sequences remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong moments ("The first stroke was a scream"). However, several instances of purple prose ("belly of the earth," "feral and bright") and some redundancy in describing the cave's qualities.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "The dome hummed like a dying bee" and effective rhythm variation. Some redundancy in the fear descriptions ("squirmed, not with malice, but with recognition") and occasional overwriting ("the friction of two truths"). Information density is high but a few passages could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most lines advance story, atmosphere, and character simultaneously. Minor figurative excess appears ("like a slow exhale," "like a half-remembered secret," "like a misplaced note") but doesn't obscure clarity. The final image effectively recharges earlier motifs without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy: "vulnerability was a cipher waiting to be cracked," "strength wasn't in the locking away." The metaphorical density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in the middle third. No major loops or scaffolding, but the figurative-to-literal ratio could be better balanced.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong propulsive prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for two instances of mild overwriting: "grotesque blooms" and "silent stars" feel slightly forced, and one paraphrase loop around the gravity concept in paragraph 5.

The "library/quiet/light" sequence shows excellent compression.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "aurora bled violet and silver" and "stalactites dripped, slow as regret." Template cadence appears in "The forger [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs.

    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("knee-deep in myth," "fingers sticky with sap") but several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "pushed back with meaning," "something older," "ghost of static." The filter-verb cluster around discovery ("he saw," "he reached," "he knelt") dulls a crucial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The pane was cold, older than the stars he charted"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("crown," "sermon," "throne" stacked too quickly) and mild template cadence in "He wasn't just... He was..." construction. The prose maintains momentum but occasional abstract phrasing ("assembled from scraps of older myths") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dunes shifting like restless giants") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("positively wistful," "gleaned redemption") and mild template cadence in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with moments of strong imagery like "rain lashing the cobblestones in a rhythm like a warden's footsteps." Template cadence appears in multiple "Elias [verb]" constructions and some paraphrase loops ("Not for forgiveness. / For the work."). The extended ending dilutes momentum after the primary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The workshop hung above the acid sea like a rusted prayer" establishes setting, stakes, and tone simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though several overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("roots curling around his ankles like pleading fingers"). Information density is adequate but uneven—some passages do multiple jobs while others, particularly in reflection, loop slightly. The "destined mismatches" phrase and similar prompt-echoes create mild template feel in places.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence structure and purposeful repetition ("strangely honest, strangely whole"). Some figurative density in places ("like breath through reeds," "the way the desert states thirst," "like a second heartbeat") but serves accumulative texture. Minor scaffold in explaining wisdom's survival method reduces score.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence lengths creating visual rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or theme simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("trapped storm of green and gold") but suffers from occasional overwrought metaphor density and some template cadence in the memory section. The "serpentine" repetition works as pattern but borders on excessive. Information density is generally high with purposeful rhythm variation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of exceptional beauty—"cathedral of moss," "honeyed hush"—but suffers from occasional redundancy ("quiet rhythm"/"quietly proactive") and filter verb clusters. The "watchful dreamer" epithet feels like prompt-checking. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks maintain momentum despite these friction points.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("lucidly watchful" feels forced, "voices that whispered *not good enough, not true enough*" uses italics as emotional shorthand) and some metaphor density in high-pressure beats without full payoff. The template-like parade of cameo figures creates mild repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("leaves rustling like a gathering hush") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract declarations ("The melody was a key, and the lock was time itself"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("songs her people had let slip into silence" echoes the earlier "no one remembered the songs anymore").

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs—"her breath curling like smoke" establishes cold, life, and fragility simultaneously. Some metaphor density in peak moments ("patience as endless as the dark") approaches overwriting but coheres with the lyric mode. Clean prose mechanics with purposeful fragment use that serves rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density works purposefully with lines doing multiple jobs: "The timer had once regulated the harvest of echoes" establishes worldbuilding, stakes, and loss simultaneously. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity ("the cellar of his reason, where he stored things that defied immediate use"). Some paraphrase loops appear: "It wasn't about preservation. / It was about *access*" restates rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("boundary-lessly trapped," some modifier stacking) and slight template cadence in the middle catalog of weights. The closing section regains strength with controlled, resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the kettle's whistle" marking time while echoing absence. Some filter-verb clustering ("she climbed," "she worked," "she sold") and occasional abstraction ("hauntingly practical rhythm") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagistic precision and information density in most lines. Deductions for paraphrase loops around the ghost iterations ("each holding a different failure" followed by listing failures) and some abstract labeling. The prose maintains momentum but occasional scaffolding ("She didn't turn") and filter constructions weaken immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision: "hope itself had been a fleeting attraction," "intent, like a tool waiting for its purpose." Some repetitive structures appear ("She didn't fix... She repurposed," "She didn't cheer. She calculated") though they create purposeful cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "the whispers were messages"/"the glass would confess" and "preserved them"/"preserved the hush" restate without advancement. Template cadence appears in "He rose...stepped...Kneeling, he pressed" sequence. The closing image achieves strong propulsion with "The orrery tick-tick-ticked, and the world answered."

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The radio beside her hissed static, the morning broadcast long dead"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("lies as scaffolding/architecture" metaphor extended across multiple beats) and occasional abstraction ("the absence of answers") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "breath a ghost against the cold" and effective variation. Some template cadence appears mid-story ("He'd found...He'd been...") and slight overwriting in places ("infinitely patient" used twice, some synonym accumulation around "knotted/woven/braided"). The closing sequence achieves strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence—"the city belonged to those who stayed—not by choice, but by the quiet weight of things unsaid"—with strong information density. However, some figurative language feels overwrought ("skeletal vines," "dragging the ground like fingers tracing a wound") and abstract statements occasionally replace concrete action ("mapping the geography of healing"). Template cadence appears in the final section with repeated "He would" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("bitter-sweet ache of living," "numb efficiency") and some repetitive structures ("It was not...It was something new"). Information density is high in descriptive passages but occasionally loops conceptually (beauty/ugliness dichotomy restated). No major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of concrete imagery ("fingers tracing the black sand," "coin's weight steady against her ribs") alternate with overwritten passages that slow momentum ("shadows drifting like kelp on an unseen tide"). Template cadence appears in the final section with repetitive "She would/The village would/The boy would" structures. The prose achieves clarity but occasionally sacrifices propulsion for lyrical effect, particularly in transitional passages.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong rhythmic variation and purposeful imagery ("V-formations dissolving into the horizon like a breath held too long"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("luminous skeptic" feels forced) and slight register drift in philosophical moments. The prose serves the accumulative design but occasionally reaches for effect over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some ornamental phrases don't advance pressure ("petals of ionized gas drifting in the slow gravity of forgotten stars"). Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions mid-story, but the closing sequence maintains strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several metaphor chains strain coherence—"veined with starlight," "the dead teaching the living what they'd failed to in life." Template structures appear ("The greenhouse shuddered. / Not from wind, but from...") and some passages loop conceptually, particularly around grief metaphors in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though several instances of abstract philosophizing ("Absolution, Elias decided...") and some filter constructions ("Elias let himself emerge"). Information density is high in descriptive passages but occasionally loops in the reflective sections about guilt and acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the widow Hester, younger, her hands pressed to her belly"), but some figurative density accumulates without full payoff ("stars hung low enough to touch"). Minor template cadence appears in the unknotting sequence ("The first knot... The second knot..."), though the progression justifies the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions—description that reveals character perception and advances theme. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("the groundedly imaginative act") but remains within Liora's established lexicon. No loops or scaffolding detected, and the prose maintains strong forward momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong figurative language throughout ("mist coiled...thick as regret," "dust on their fingers would remember how to whisper") creates atmosphere but occasionally obscures clarity—how exactly does dust "tell" someone where to find Elias? Some repetitive constructions appear ("Elias had spent," "He'd found," "He began"). The final section's passive construction of Elias's disappearance weakens momentum when active choice would strengthen closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Some metaphorical density in places ("horizon" metaphor, "weaving" metaphor) creates slight overwriting without harming clarity. The "bones settling" simile and powder description sequences show excellent textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("warped iron bolted to the wall," "brass was pitted, its teeth worn uneven"). Some filter-verb clusters appear ("He knew she wasn't lying," "he'd decided") and occasional abstraction ("Progress is a story they tell"). The opening and closing lines are particularly strong, bookending with copper/lies and the ticking cog.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative control ("bleeding amber," "traveled stillness") with good information density. Some metaphor density in opening paragraphs borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative design. Deduction for occasional abstraction ("the way hatred worked—the way it unlearned people") and filter-verb clustering in the reflection passages, though these don't touch the crystalline closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Some instances of elevated diction that border on overwriting ("the veil between what was and what could be thinned to silk"). Minor template cadence in the ending's parallel structures.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in metaphor density ("words spilled...raw as honey from a crushed comb" followed immediately by "curse felt heavier"). Some template cadence in the resolution sequence ("The engineers would come...Elias would tell them...They wouldn't believe him") reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery ("curtains long after the woman herself was gone"), though several passages contain unnecessary abstraction and filter constructions. Lines like "She understood now" and "for the first time, she didn't feel like" create distance where immediacy would strengthen impact, and some metaphorical reaches ("like a cup holds light") strain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("coral-encrusted plaques as if reading the dead city's pulse"), but several filter-verb clusters and some elevated diction ("structural weakness of their certainty") that doesn't fully match the visceral underwater setting. The "tap-tap-tapping" metaphor works well. Minor repetition in "the human's" construction could vary more.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several paraphrase loops weaken density: "Some textures weren't meant to be captured. / Some opportunities were only opportunities because they slipped away" restates without advancing. Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions appears multiple times. Strong opening and closing lines partially compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "languages of curved thorns and floating dots." Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some repetitive structures appear ("He wondered if," "Somewhere") and occasional abstraction around kindness concepts. The "methodically hopeful" phrase feels slightly forced, and there's minor template cadence in the final "Somewhere" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong sensory detail, but several overwrought metaphors slow momentum ("thin as the last thread of a spider's abandoned web," "flour dusting her wrinkles like ash"). Some paraphrase loops appear in the final third (multiple iterations of communal revival), though the closing image lands with appropriate density.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some overwriting appears ("brass innards," "latent—something radiant—coiled inside"). Minor template cadence in the ending's "Still spinning. / Still falling. / Still *initiate*" structure and occasional density excess ("raw and bleak and exhilarated all at once") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong figurative language creates atmosphere, but density occasionally overwhelms clarity—nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats contains metaphor or unusual construction. Template cadence appears in the final section ("Lysander smiled. Then he walked... Somewhere, a camera's shutter clicked"). The prose achieves memorable moments ("mirrors still breathed") but suffers from overwriting that obscures rather than illuminates key beats, particularly the rushed confrontation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs ("The clouds above twisted, their underbellies darkening into the shape of a hand"). Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("bled indigo," "coiled like unplayed sheet music") but it serves the accumulative mode. Minor repetition of "restlessness" but overall momentum stays strong through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with lines like "The air thickened" providing punch. Some passages edge toward overwriting ("threads of light," "into the whistle's ghost, into the cracks that had always been doors") and the final philosophical meditation risks scaffold, but overall clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("ivy strangled the iron bones," "light as a promise, heavy as a key"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("thick as mildew," "smooth as confession booth's curtain") and minor redundancy in describing the B twice. The "emotionally rational as ever" feels like a prompt echo.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("drawbridge groaned," "water lapped at the edges of his waders") with good rhythmic variation. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("the need to wrest meaning from what others abandoned" restates prior content) and some abstract phrasing ("interlaced absence was its power") reduces clarity. Template cadence in "He + verb" constructions appears in succession.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence lengths and strong imagery like "waterlogged ledgers, their pages warped but still legible." However, filter verb clusters appear ("caught his eye," "felt like," "barely noticed") and some passages lean toward tell over show ("His motivation wasn't curiosity; it was deeper"). The writing is competent but lacks the razor precision needed for 8+ bands.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("steam curled like unspoken promises between cupped hands") but suffers from density overload with figurative language in nearly every sentence. Some metaphor vehicles clash (architectural spine/organic breathing), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong propulsion with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density high in most beats. Deductions for abstract phrasing in the perturbation theory section that slows momentum and the slightly overwrought "pocket of unused time" metaphor cluster that approaches density excess without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "last sliver of sun bled into the horizon." Several abstract insertions weaken momentum: "the missing piece" explanation, "everything was exactly where it belonged." Minor template cadence in "She didn't tell him... She didn't need to... She simply listened."

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "stretched like a bruise," "slithered into his thoughts," and repetitive conceptual phrasing around "withheld truth" and "weight." The filter-heavy construction "he realized he'd never once tried" dulls immediacy in a key realization moment.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well. Deductions for overwriting in places ("mist that curled like ghostly fingers," "moon hung at half-mast"), some template phrasing ("Elias didn't react," "Elias allowed himself"), and occasional purple patches that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("He'd...", "He...") and occasional overwriting ("merrily melancholic," "the kind of blue that swallowed apologies whole"). Several paraphrase loops appear, like the redundant emphasis on choosing charts over daughter. Information density is uneven, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely restate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The stitching was frayed, the signature a jagged J. T. Morrow"), but several instances of overwriting appear: "delicately robust" feels forced, and metaphor density in the lake sequence ("mirror of bioluminescent veins, pulsing in time with something he couldn't hear") occasionally obscures clarity. Some filter verbs could be cut for immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("edges flickering like candle flame," "cold of deep water"). Template structure appears in "She was..." constructions. Information density is high with most lines serving multiple purposes, but occasional abstraction ("things older than memory") dilutes specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Moonlight bled through the canopy"). Information density is high with purposeful figurative language. However, some overwriting appears ("forgotten breath," "slow unraveling of regret") and a few template constructions ("She didn't weep. She *unfastened*."). The italicized emphasis feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong opening "ship of bones—human bones" and closing "She stayed" create propulsive frame. Information density high throughout, with lines doing multiple jobs. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She [verb]. The [noun] [verb].") and occasional paraphrase loops ("She began to stitch" follows closely after describing her stitching). Figurative language mostly lands, though "ladder of light" feels slightly stock.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("her wealth measured in borrowed time and the quiet gasps of strangers"). Some figurative density in places ("the celestial bodies dragged their heels") but it serves the accumulative mode. Minor template moments ("Elira laughed, sharp and bright") prevent higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but figurative density sometimes overwhelms ("luminous fort...clung...like a lantern"). Template structures appear ("Kael exhaled...Kael's lips twitched...Kael's tools flashed") that create mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative language occasionally tips toward density ("aurora above pulsed like a dying heartbeat, its green and violet threads tangling") but serves the accumulative mode. Some filter constructions ("Liora saw herself") could be more immediate, though rhythm effectively accelerates through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks, but several overwriting issues: mixed metaphors ("clouds unraveling like a censored line"), redundant phrasing ("silenced verses"/"censored poet"), and occasional purple prose in descriptive passages. The filter-verb stack ("he knew," "he didn't need") in the final section dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful syntax ("A coded overture" as fragment for emphasis). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("like shattered diamonds," "as calculated as the angles") and occasional register elevation ("curdled into something fiercer"). The paraphrase loop "Took you long enough"/"First door on the left" could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs. However, significant paraphrase loops damage momentum: "rebuilding not just a library, but a way to survive the bloom" followed immediately by similar restatements. The phrase "fractured luminous thing" appears twice. Template cadence in the final third with repetitive "When/By/And" openers reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the horizon was swallowing the sun") but some overwriting in figurative density ("compasses...flickered like dying fireflies"). The "strategically creative" phrase feels workshopped rather than organic, and mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("piano's notes stretching behind her like a wake").

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("a taste like the first question ever asked"). Template cadence appears in the middle section ("She had spent years...," "She pocketed...," "She gasped...") creating mechanical rhythm. Some paraphrase loops around memory/forgetting concepts reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    While moments achieve strong imagery ("the exact blue of a held-back *I'm sorry*"), the prose suffers from overwriting in places: "trembling gold, like sunlight through a held breath" strains the metaphor. Some passages loop conceptually, particularly around the compass's significance, though the closure image lands cleanly.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language (“cathedral of glass,” “neutron star’s crust”) is consistent and voice-motivated. There is no scaffold, loop, or syntactic monotony. A minor deduction for one potentially over-stacked metaphor (“like broken teeth”) in the high-pressure opening.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.8)
    Exemplary line-level craft with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. The final paragraph's cadence is masterful, each sentence advancing the resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a tomb of winterglass," "a cathedral of sound") which, while beautiful, creates a dense texture. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density, though slight over-reliance on figurative language in peak beats ("like a trapped scream") mildly risks coherence. No loops or scaffolding; rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures. Minor overwriting in phrases like "quiet amplification of survival" slightly dulls momentum, but clarity remains intact. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language ("thorns sharp as promises") is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, serving atmosphere and character. A single, minor artifact exists: the phrase "a past life that surfaced in fragments" uses a slightly common metaphor ("surfaced"), but it is not a loop and does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density. Rhythm is excellent, though there is minor synonym churn ("disintegrated photograph dust"). A single mixed metaphor ("voices rising into a chorus") appears in a high-pressure beat but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sharp and consistent ("jagged scar of concrete," "green shoot would break through the dust"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in action beats and breathing in reflective moments. No grammatical errors or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is a minor risk of overwriting in peak beats ("the color of dawn over a field of broken tools"), but the figurative language is coherent and serves the closure effect. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("a wound of gold and violet") enhances clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure. Read-aloud quality is exceptional; every line advances story or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor figurative overload in peak beats ("her breath a fleeting sculpture") slightly obscures clarity but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion is strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor artifacts: "like a trapped thing" is a slight cliché, and "the shell now silent" is a near-duplicate of earlier descriptions. However, these do not obscure closure or causality. Figurative language is generally sharp and purposeful ("iron shelves sagging like old bones").

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("like a splinter of ice," "like gilded snow") is consistent and purposeful, never muddy. Sentence-level propulsion varies perfectly with the scene's needs, from long, accumulating sentences to the final, stark fragments. Zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight figurative cluster in the paragraph beginning "The sound amalgamated with the twilight," where multiple metaphors operate in close proximity, though coherence is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose is luminous and virtually flawless. High information density with zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is precise, coherent, and deeply integrated ("the rain’s afterglow," "the ghost of it"). Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic variety are masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density with clear propulsion. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("shattered promises" slightly decorative) but no coherence issues. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm supports emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly inventive ("time *spilled*. / Sideways."). Sentence-level rhythm is varied and masterfully supports the accumulating pressure. A single, hairline moment of potential register drift ("unfold from stasis") is fully voice-motivated and does not harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("a throat holding a scream"). Read-aloud rhythm is exquisite, varying naturally with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero prose artifacts; high information density with figurative language that consistently advances atmosphere and character ("fever had scoured her clean, but not empty"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, and the closure image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures accelerating tension. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("ribs of rusted track," "weight of a swallowed truth"). Minor register drift in psychic's dialogue ("Caller, are you still there?") but confined to her voice and does not muddy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative overload in the refuge's description ("walls exhaled dust that reformed into lost languages"), which, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring immediacy at a peak beat. Otherwise, line-level craft is exemplary and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly concise and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "her fingers twisted the hem of her shirt like a metronome stuck on allegro"). Rhythm is controlled, and information density is high. A single, slight mixed metaphor ("pulse thrumming like a plucked bass string") is a hairline slip that doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is flawless, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity ("the harmonic of a plucked wire"). Syntax and rhythm are perfectly controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. A single minor artifact: the metaphor "the ink still damp with something heavier than soy sauce" is slightly strained, creating a momentary clarity dip in an otherwise flawless opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and purposeful variation. Figurative language is consistent and legible, though a single mixed metaphor ("decorated the air like frost on glass") slightly muddles an otherwise pristine peak beat. Momentum is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor artifact: "the ink bleeding into the shape of a treble clef" risks a slightly overly-convenient metaphor, but it is pattern-taught by the musical motif and pays off at closure, so the deduction is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor figurative muddle: "darkening brightness" slightly strains coherence in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated ("a filament of hush," "the air thick with the ghost of rhythms"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, and the closing paragraph achieves lyrical resonance without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("a breath held between day and night," "wings cutting the air like a blade through silk") is precise, purposeful, and never muddled. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in perfect step with the scene's needs.

== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, strong verbs, and precise, original imagery. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; the prose propels the meditative pace forward with clarity and grace. A minor deduction is made for the slight register shift in the phrase "The Theory of Kindled Humility," which feels a touch more academic and less integrated than the surrounding lyrical prose.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong verbs and concrete imagery. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels self-conscious rather than fully integrated into the character's perception. The final paragraphs employ a series of short, declarative fragments ("The quiet kind. The kind you follow.") that, while stylistically deliberate, verge on a familiar cadence. Overall, the line-level craft is very strong but lacks the final polish of absolute concision.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, with a high density of information and imagery that never sacrifices clarity or momentum. Sentence and paragraph structures are varied to create a compelling rhythm, moving from short, stark statements ("Nothing. Of course.") to flowing, complex descriptions. While highly figurative, the language remains controlled and purposeful, serving the story's unique atmosphere without becoming overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is consistently strong, characterized by high information density, striking figurative language, and a compelling rhythm. Sentences like "The lighthouse was a ribcage of iron and glass" achieve both vivid description and thematic weight. While the density of similes borders on being excessive, it remains a coherent stylistic choice that enhances the story's ethereal tone rather than detracting from its clarity or momentum. The line-level craft is polished and professional.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, concise, and demonstrates high information density, with sentences that are both functional and evocative. The rhythm is controlled beautifully, accelerating at the climax and settling into a lyrical cadence for the resolution. A minor deduction is warranted for the slight conceptual redundancy in the final paragraphs, where the same core thematic idea is restated in slightly different phrasing, momentarily slowing the powerful forward momentum of the closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. However, the density of figurative language is relentlessly high, occasionally bordering on overwritten ("spine of crumbling stone," "wreathed in twilight’s violet haze," "light that seemed to whisper"). While the quality of the imagery is high, its sheer volume can slightly impede momentum and clarity rather than enhance it, creating a uniform texture that lacks contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet remains clear and propulsive, a high-risk style that pays off by fully immersing the reader in the story’s surreal logic. The sentence structure varies to control pace, and word choice is consistently precise and evocative (e.g., “disintegrated into motes of gold,” “unraveled... into a thousand glowing filaments”). The piece is free of line-level artifacts, scaffolding, or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density, precise word choice, and varied syntax creating excellent momentum. The prose is clean and evocative throughout the main action sequence. The score is slightly tempered by the final few paragraphs, where a dense clustering of figurative language and a series of short, parallel sentences ("But so was she. So were the seeds.") create a cadence that feels slightly programmatic, momentarily slowing the narrative's organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is stunning, with high information density and evocative, precise language. The rhythm is masterful, especially in the final paragraphs. The only minor reservation is that the sheer density of figurative language occasionally risks becoming overwrought, though it consistently lands within the story's heightened, speculative tone without breaking immersion or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless density of figurative language occasionally verges on being overwritten, particularly in high-pressure moments. Lines like "the sound bending like a blade" are slightly less imaginative than their surroundings. While the overall effect is powerful, a more judicious use of metaphor would heighten the impact of the strongest images rather than creating a uniform, high-gloss texture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are constructed with a poet's ear for rhythm and cadence ("her breath a fleeting sculpture in the chill"). There is a minor reliance on a few common similes ("frosted over like forgotten breath," "cracked open like an egg"), which are the only hairline flaws in an otherwise impeccable piece. The overall craft is clean, concise, and carries significant emotional weight without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and concrete imagery ("its jagged edge biting into her palm"). The rhythm is well-paced, building tension effectively. A few phrases in the final two paragraphs drift toward familiar cliché ("cracks that let the light in," "stars burned brighter, like they’d been waiting"), slightly dulling the sharpness of an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and almost entirely free of artifacts. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing atmosphere, character, or theme with remarkable economy.

The piece demonstrates exceptional syntactic variety and rhythmic control, creating a propulsive yet contemplative momentum that carries the reader effortlessly to the quiet, powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is the story's greatest strength, demonstrating exceptional clarity, rhythm, and information density. Every sentence works to advance the narrative and deepen the atmosphere, with striking and original imagery ("delicate curves of frozen music," "pins in a cosmic board"). There are no wasted words, prose artifacts, or overwrought passages, even during the most abstract moments of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and precise for most of the story, with high information density and evocative imagery ("a shrug dissolving into the hush"). However, the final act exhibits minor scaffolding. The anaphora in "For the next quiet soul... For the next pair of hands..." creates a template cadence that feels more like a thematic summary than lived prose. This slight shift toward telling, combined with the thematic statements, keeps an otherwise exceptional piece just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and rhythmic, demonstrating high information density where each sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. Figurative language, such as the cracks gleaming "like veins of silver" and light scattered "like shattered promises," is consistently effective and thematically coherent. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, achieving a polished, professional quality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with no discernible artifacts or scaffolding. Figurative language, such as "a school of fish caught in a slow, sideways current" and "the field collapsing like a held note released," is both beautiful and precise. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the narrative forward. Every line serves a purpose, contributing to character, atmosphere, or the advancement of the central idea.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep into overwriting. Figurative language, such as the water lapping "like a slow, patient tongue," is fresh and purposeful. The sentences have a musical cadence that mirrors the story's subject, accelerating during the discovery and slowing to a sustained note at the climax. There are no redundant phrases, scaffolding, or template patterns; every word contributes to momentum and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality, characterized by high information density, striking figurative language ("half-healed scar," "storm unspool itself"), and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with high information density. However, the final few paragraphs slip into a more declarative, summary-like mode with some template cadence ("a girl finding her voice, a mother unclenching her fear..."). While generally strong, this shift slightly dulls the immediacy of the otherwise potent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong verbs and a well-managed rhythm. Sentences like "his usual calculus of profit yielded to something softer" demonstrate high information density. The piece is slightly weakened by the final parenthetical; while it clarifies the cost, it functions as a narrative shortcut, telling the reader the consequence rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the implication.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and precise for the most part, but a few moments rely on familiar phrasing. "The realization struck her like the first crack of lightning" is a stock simile at a pivotal moment, and the phrase "peel away what no longer served it" drifts slightly into a therapeutic register that feels less specific than the surrounding text. These minor blemishes slightly dull an otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and rhythmic precision. Figurative language is consistently fresh and potent, such as the cavern walls that "pulsed with bioluminescent veins, a fossilized map of the island’s forgotten veins."

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and confident, with high information density and strong rhythm. The opening paragraph is a masterclass in establishing tone and theme. A few minor instances of conceptual abstraction ("an absence shaped by the space around it") and near-paraphrasing ("not just an object; it was a pause") are the only hairline slips preventing a perfect score. There are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.4)

The rhythm of the sentences modulates perfectly with the emotional beats of the story, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often luminous, with high information density. However, the final section relies on a repetitive cadence of short, aphoristic sentences ("She had been a skeptic. Now she was a cartographer of echoes."). This template-like structure, while impactful in isolation, becomes a noticeable prose artifact that summarizes the conclusion rather than allowing the final images to carry the full weight of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and a compelling rhythm that modulates with the scene's intensity.

    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density and striking figurative language ("like pulling a drowned thing from the river and watching it gasp back to life"). The rhythm is controlled and elegant. A minor deduction is warranted for the final two paragraphs, which, while beautifully written, slightly slow the momentum by summarizing the theme and motivation that the preceding scenes had already rendered with perfect clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, varied sentence structure, and powerful, specific imagery. There are no wasted words or movements. A minor deduction is warranted for the final two paragraphs, where the aphoristic, thematic statements ("Some poisons were meant to be absorbed") momentarily shift from the concrete, sensory language that characterizes the rest of the piece, creating a slight textural change just before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and striking imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's mythic, resonant tone. A minor critique is the use of italicized phrases like "*a retelling*" and "*a conversation*," which feel slightly like authorial signposting, though they don't significantly detract from the momentum or clarity of an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is confident, rhythmic, and dense with imagery. Sentences like “Lumina’s resistance didn’t march; it reorganized” are particularly strong. A few instances of mild scaffolding, where a sentence explains the symbolic meaning of an action just performed (e.g., “The mural wasn’t just a warning; it was a foundation”), slightly reduce the overall economy and prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and dense with meaning, achieving propulsion through strong verbs and evocative imagery. Figurative language, such as "the sun’s first knife-edge of light" and "the universe clearing its throat," is fresh and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative for most of the piece. The imagery is precise and memorable. The score is lowered due to a shift from showing to telling in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "the scales felt even" and the explicit thematic statement summarize the outcome rather than grounding it in a final, concrete image, slightly dulling the sharpness of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative figurative language ("time itself thinned like frayed silk"). Momentum is generally excellent, propelled by varied and rhythmic sentences. The only minor weakness is in the final few paragraphs, where the syntax becomes more declarative and risks feeling like summary scaffolding, slightly breaking from the more immersive prose that precedes it.

    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and precise. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously without a hint of overwriting.

There are no textual artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; the rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled to create a hypnotic, propulsive momentum. This is publication-ready work on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose achieves a rare balance of being lushly poetic and ruthlessly concise, with almost every sentence performing multiple functions. The rhythm is controlled, and the imagery is consistently striking and purposeful, avoiding ornamental language. The line "a slash of dawn like a wound healing backward" is a moment of pure, unforgettable craft.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and a powerful, sustained rhythm. Figurative language is not ornamental but structural, with the central metaphor of weaving ("each step a stitch") providing the story's propulsive logic.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is luminous, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, lyrical, and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting, risking a loss of propulsion. The final image of the smudges glowing “*like embers cupped in careful hands*” feels slightly less original than the preceding prose and a touch too self-consciously poetic, a minor slip in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.6)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and dense with purposeful imagery. However, the final paragraphs, while stylistically deliberate, verge on scaffold-like statements ("The garden breathed. The pause endured."). The direct address contains lines that read like thematic labels ("exchange what you know for what you might discover"), slightly dulling the sharp, evocative craft that defines the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. The figurative language is consistently inventive and powerful. The sheer density occasionally verges on being overwhelming, a high-wire act that succeeds but creates a texture so rich it borders on saturation, preventing a higher score despite the absence of technical flaws like loops or scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. Figurative language, such as "ink that whispered" and "ozone and foxglove regret," is audacious but lands effectively within the story’s heightened reality. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the propulsion from the first line to the last is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is elegant and packed with strong, specific imagery. However, the final sequence introduces several line-level artifacts that disrupt the flow. The repetition of "The point was..." reads as a template cadence, and the juxtaposition of "The paths had not yet diverged" with the later "The paths converged" feels less resonant than intended. While the majority of the prose is exceptional, this scaffolding at the very end dulls the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and vivid, purposeful imagery. Sentences are constructed with rhythmic variety and consistently advance the story's purpose.

    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery. While the figurative language is consistently strong ("clinking against the others like bones in a diviner’s bag"), there are moments where the sheer density of metaphor slightly thickens the momentum.

There are no wasted words or motions.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with figurative language that consistently deepens atmosphere and character rather than feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with a strong command of rhythm and imagery. However, a few sentences function as abstract, reflective scaffolding that momentarily pauses the in-scene momentum ("This was how ideals became practice...", "Redemption wasn’t a single act..."). While beautifully phrased, these prose artifacts slightly dilute the otherwise impeccable 'show, don't tell' discipline of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with powerful, evocative imagery ("chiseling regrets from her own ribs"). The rhythm is controlled, accelerating and decelerating with the ritual's progress.

    The prose is evocative and precise, with high information density in its sensory details. Sentences are well-constructed with varied rhythms.

    The prose is polished, dense, and rhythmic, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is rich and consistent with the story's internal logic, particularly the synesthesia of tasting silence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, a few phrases rely on familiar constructions ("bleeding into dawn," "cascade of golden shards," "a held breath finally released") that slightly soften the otherwise sharp and specific imagery. The final paragraph's shift toward summary ("The city would wake soon, unaware...") momentarily reduces the immediacy established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, with high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Figurative language, such as "edges blurring like ink in rain," is evocative and precise without being overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's elegiac tone without faltering.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific, sensory imagery.

The overall propulsion and clarity, especially in the high-pressure climax, are outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with a strong command of rhythm and syntax. Figurative language is consistently fresh and effective, deepening the atmosphere without ever feeling overwritten. A few sentences contain minor scaffolding or near-redundancy ("where every question only birthed another"), but these are exceptionally rare blemishes on an otherwise polished and impactful piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious, beautiful, and rhythmically complex, with a high density of fresh, effective figurative language. While the sheer density of metaphor borders on overwriting, it ultimately succeeds in creating the story’s intended mythic tone. A single, very minor instance of a paraphrase loop ("He was perpetually learning... That was the curse and the gift") is the only hairline flaw preventing a near-perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. The final section, however, relies on a long run of short, declarative sentences ("The pavilion stood. The flowers listened."). While initially effective, this pattern becomes a template cadence that feels slightly overwrought, sacrificing rhythmic variety for aphoristic weight and slightly dulling the momentum of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates a high level of craft, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction is applied for a slight tendency towards overwriting, where the density of figurative language occasionally borders on excessive ("retroactive fever dream").

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly effective, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are constructed with rhythmic control that mirrors the story's emotional progression. A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances of thematic summary near the end, such as "It wasn’t resurrection. It was something better," which slightly re-states what the preceding actions have already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is immaculate. Word choice is precise and evocative ("salt-thick air," "giggled as a dead president’s voice scratched through time," "tongue numbed by the shape of dead syllables"). Figurative language is fresh and consistently reinforces the story’s themes of fragility and memory. The prose is dense with meaning yet maintains a clear, forward momentum, with zero evidence of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting. The final paragraph, in particular, demonstrates rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with very few wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the final seven paragraphs are marred by conceptual loops and scaffold-like phrasing ("The end was never the point. The point was..."). This repetition of the theme in abstract terms stalls the story’s momentum and dulls the power of the final concrete image of Eli walking onward, constituting a significant prose artifact at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and rhythmic control that shifts beautifully at the climax. Figurative language is strong and coherent, avoiding cliché and serving the story's atmosphere. There is a slight tendency toward abstract nouns to carry thematic weight (“the weight of his own silence,” “the weight of unspoken things”), which, while effective, momentarily dilutes the otherwise concrete and sensory-driven prose in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, striking figurative language, and flawless rhythm. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the central concept.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.6)

Figurative language is inventive and precise ("its absence luminous as a wound," "edges fraying like tattered silk") without becoming overwrought. The piece demonstrates remarkable concision and momentum, with every word contributing to atmosphere, character, or plot. A minor observation is the slight dip in intensity in the final two lines, which, while clean, don't quite match the raw power of the climax preceding them.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)

    The prose is elegant and precise, with powerful, resonant phrasing ("woven hush," "map of scars, not sins"). Momentum is well-maintained through a varied and rhythmic sentence structure.

    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and a strong, consistent rhythm. Word choice is precise and imagery is vivid ("opal dock," "a vein of forgotten bone"). There are minor instances of near-redundancy that slightly slow the momentum, for example, "The memories weren’t his. They were echoes..." which circles the same idea. Overall, however, the line-level craft is of a very high caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exquisite from the first sentence to the last. Line-level craft is a significant strength, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and evocative but controlled figurative language ("foxfire trapped in metal," "carapaces iridescent as oil slicks").

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its descriptions of the farm. The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for observation and quickening with Lena's internal shifts. The piece is nearly flawless at the line level, but it is slightly marred by a tendency toward thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("The world was full of doors...").

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is luminous, dense with information, and propelled by a strong, varied rhythm. However, the final two paragraphs, while beautifully phrased, function as a thematic summary that slightly lessens the impact of the preceding scene work. Lines like "She would return, as she always did, to steep the past into the present..." tell the reader what has already been powerfully shown, a minor but distinct flaw that feels like scaffolding left on an otherwise immaculate structure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and rhythmic propulsion.

There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and no prose artifacts to dull the momentum. The writing achieves a rare state of being both ornate and surgically clean, driving the narrative forward while simultaneously deepening the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density in nearly every line. Figurative language is purposeful and thematically coherent, particularly the contrast between the archive as tomb and womb. While a few phrases verge on the familiar ("The sun rose, indifferent"), the overall craft is superb, marked by strong verbs, varied syntax, and a clean, propulsive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong verbs and striking imagery. However, the density of figurative language in the story's second half, particularly around the climax, is high enough to slightly diminish the impact of individual metaphors. While the rhythm and clarity remain strong, a more restrained hand with the similes would have allowed the most crucial images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with no wasted words or motion.

The prose is the story's strongest asset, creating a powerful, immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates masterful control of rhythm and imagery. While the high density of figurative language borders on overwriting, it remains consistent and serves the story's specific tone, thus reading as a deliberate and successful stylistic choice. A minor slip occurs with the slightly generic phrase "something deeper, something hungry," which momentarily breaks the otherwise pristine surface in the final third, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is frequently stunning, with high information density and powerful verbs. However, the final few paragraphs become slightly repetitive in their thematic declarations ("He hadn't become anything. He'd only remembered," followed by statements on freedom, his true nature, and the key). This creates a minor loop of conceptual summary that dulls the momentum of the story’s potent final actions and images.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control from the opening sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lyrical, precise, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences are beautifully constructed with varied rhythm and strong imagery ("translucent as dawn on spider silk"). The piece is nearly flawless, but a few phrases—such as "where the only con left was convincing himself he deserved to try"—lean into abstraction and thematic summary, momentarily thinning the otherwise impeccable "show, don't tell" execution.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive, with fresh and thematically coherent figurative language. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic effect, accelerating and decelerating in sync with Liora's internal state.

The piece is free of scaffolding or textual loops, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density in its descriptions. However, the coda following the climax—"Her paintings sold for fortunes. Her music made strangers weep."—is a significant flaw. It resorts to telling and summarizing success, a jarring shift from the powerful, immersive showing of the central scene that slightly deflates the story's powerful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is evocative and dense with well-crafted imagery, maintaining momentum throughout. The sentences are rhythmically varied, and the word choice is precise. However, a few phrases like "weighed nothing and everything" or "like a memory trying to settle" lean towards familiar poetic constructions, slightly softening the otherwise sharp and original line-level execution. These moments are brief and do not touch the closure, but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and startlingly original figurative language ("a tuning fork pressed to the ribs of the world").

    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every line serving character, atmosphere, and plot. The figurative language is rich and evocative ("edges frayed like the hem of a god’s discarded robe"). While the density of similes is very high, it is stylistically consistent and supports the mythic tone rather than obscuring clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—elegant, economical, and evocative. The syntax and rhythm vary to match the story's pacing, from the slow, metronomic opening to the swift, decisive climax.

    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. Information density is high, with most sentences serving multiple functions. The piece walks a fine line between masterful lyricism and overwriting; a few phrases like "senselessly perceptive silence" feel more consciously poetic than grounded in the moment. This slight self-consciousness in the figurative language is the only element holding it back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished to a high sheen, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is potent and consistent, as in "the air split like wet silk" or teeth "made of broken echoes." While the line-level craft is nearly flawless, the final two lines ("He smiled. It smiled back.") verge on a familiar genre trope, a minor stumble in an otherwise masterful performance that slightly dulls the specificity of the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious, lyrical, and dense with imagery, creating a powerful atmosphere. However, this density occasionally borders on being overwritten, with figurative language stacked heavily in key moments (e.g., "a topographic map of grief, of longing, of a planet holding its breath"). While effective, this high register is sustained so consistently that it slightly dampens momentum and lacks dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Information density is high, with sentences that build character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously.

    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, strong verbs, and evocative, original metaphors ("the valley stretched like a held breath," "snow here held secrets like a ledger"). The prose is clean and propulsive, with varied sentence structures creating a confident rhythm. The final two sentences, while thematically resonant, verge on summarizing the story’s earned conclusion, a slight narrative scaffolding that detracts from an otherwise flawless execution of show-don't-tell. This is a hairline flaw in an exemplary piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely stellar, with high information density and evocative, precise language ("glass skeletons glinting... like the ribs of something starved"). A significant penalty is applied for the final two sentences, which are a prose artifact—a shift into an authorial, explanatory register that dulls the closure image by summarizing its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with a strong internal rhythm. Figurative language is deployed with precision and creates a cohesive atmosphere.

    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with evocative, muscular prose that carries significant emotional and atmospheric weight. The opening and the climactic trade are rendered with exceptional clarity and power. A slight deduction is warranted for the final two paragraphs, which contain some minor thematic scaffolding and paraphrase-looping ("The orchard watched, and waited, and was content... The dead slept easier... The living learned..."). This slightly softens an otherwise razor-sharp ending.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.8)

A minor weakness is a tendency toward declarative explanations of the story's own mechanics, such as "The watch wasn’t just a key—it was a thief..."

The rhythm is stately and controlled, accelerating slightly during the ritual before settling back into the reaper's solemn gait. There are no redundant phrases, scaffold, or loops; the prose is polished to a fine, sharp edge.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished to a high sheen, characterized by high information density, strong verbs, and evocative, original metaphors like "a spine of frozen lightning." There is no wasted language; every sentence works to advance the narrative or deepen the atmosphere. The rhythm and cadence of the final paragraphs are particularly effective, creating a sense of both finality and continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is both beautiful and ruthlessly efficient, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is powerful and coherent, never decorative ("skeletal trees," "cave walls of his childhood"). There are no scaffold phrases or momentum-dragging loops; the syntax propels the narrative forward, accelerating into the ritualistic climax and settling into a quiet, resonant peace at the end. The craftsmanship is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high informational density, syntactic variety, and potent imagery. The prose propels the narrative with a confident, incantatory rhythm. A few phrases lean on archetypal language ("older than memory"), and a single sentence explaining the alchemist's sentimentality is slightly diagnostic. These are minor imperfections in what is otherwise a polished and evocative piece of writing with no significant artifacts or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density in its imagery. Lines like “the canopy unfurling like a held breath released” are exceptional. A minor penalty is applied for a few instances of abstract summary, such as “The watcher’s burden was this…,” which momentarily tells rather than shows, slightly slowing the momentum in an otherwise flawless execution of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, evocative, and precise. Every sentence carries weight, advancing character, world, or plot without a wasted word. Figurative language, such as the Schism’s wound "stitching shut with a sound like tearing silk," is both original and viscerally effective. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the piece demonstrates immaculate line-level control from its compelling opening to its resonant final line.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and purposeful, with very little waste. Figurative language is consistently strong and specific, enhancing atmosphere without becoming overwrought. Sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the story’s quiet progression. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or syntactic artifacts to dull its momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, confident, and dense with evocative imagery from the opening line. Strong, specific verbs ("macerated," "twirled") and well-crafted metaphors ("smiles were brittle things") create a rich texture. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or significant overwriting, maintaining clear momentum through its rhythmic and varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is of an exceptionally high caliber, marked by high information density, striking imagery, and syntactic variety. The language is both precise and evocative, with nearly every sentence serving character, atmosphere, and momentum. A few figurative phrases verge on the familiar ("winking eye," "spider learning to weave"), a minor point in an otherwise stellar execution that avoids overwriting or clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional: dense, rhythmic, and precise. Word choice is consistently strong, and figurative language ("shattered into teeth," "crystallized into blackened lace," "a wave of frozen bloom") builds a coherent and memorable aesthetic without ever feeling overwritten. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, with every sentence working to advance the story's momentum and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by precision, information density, and a charged, poetic rhythm. Figurative language is abundant but purposeful, building the story's specific reality rather than feeling ornamental. There are no wasted words or scaffold; every sentence propels the narrative forward or deepens the atmosphere, demonstrating remarkable line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density in every line. Figurative language, such as the ferry being "a blade through silk" or a "needle through too many layers of fabric," is not merely decorative but essential to explaining the story's unique mechanics. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the piece is polished to a high sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, confident, and demonstrates high information density. Word choice is consistently specific and evocative ("sinew thread," "irises fractal," "spiderwebbed"). The rhythm is varied and controlled, accelerating toward the climax before settling into the quiet resolution of the final lines. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's potent effect.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density and evocative, precise language. The rhythmic control is particularly effective in the climax ("A flicker. A path."). The piece is held back from the highest tier by the final two sentences, which read as a platitude—a prose artifact that slightly dulls the resonant power of the final image by summarizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language ("fracturing twilight into jagged blues," "voice, thin as spider silk"). The prose is propulsive and clean, with varied sentence structures that mirror the story's pacing. There are no wasted words or distracting prose artifacts; every sentence serves to build character, atmosphere, or forward momentum, contributing to a seamless and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely flawless, with strong verbs and striking figurative language ("crashing hush," "ghost of data"). The final paragraphs employ a repetitive, incantatory cadence ("The tide returned. The cables slept.") which is a powerful stylistic choice, but risks feeling like a template. A minor conceptual loop exists between the cables "remembering" and "keeping" things, a near-repetition that slightly softens an otherwise sharp script.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, concision, and evocative imagery. Sentences like "The opal observatory hummed beneath the snow, its domed ceiling catching the faintest glow of auroras that pulsed like a dying heartbeat" perform multiple functions with grace. The prose is free of artifacts, loops, or overwriting, maintaining clear momentum and a consistent, polished rhythm throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, yet it maintains clarity and momentum, a difficult balance to achieve. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a rich sensory tapestry without becoming overwrought, especially as the prose pares down during the climax. The final shift to short, declarative sentences provides a stark, effective cadence that brings the story to a powerful halt.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language ("eyes like polished river stones," "calm as frost on glass"). The prose propels the narrative with a confident rhythm. The final sequence of parenthetical statements is a bold stylistic choice that largely succeeds, but its sheer density and repetition create a slight drag just before the final lines, narrowly keeping it out of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm and sentence structure, moving from sparse, impactful statements ("The ground shivered.") to more complex, flowing descriptions. Information density is high, with nearly every line serving multiple functions of character, world, and mood. The piece is remarkably free of artifacts, though the initial phrasing of "resonantly soft melody" feels slightly redundant and is a rare minor stumble in otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and zero wasted words. Figurative language, such as the air tasting "like the moment before an apology," is both original and emotionally precise. The sentences are propulsive and clean, free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating a polish that is ready for immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density where each sentence builds character, atmosphere, and momentum. Figurative language is consistently striking and integrated, avoiding overwriting even in its most lyrical moments. While one or two phrases verge on the familiar (e.g., "jagged like a broken promise"), the overall rhythmic control and precision are of the highest caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptional: precise, musical, and dense with meaning. Figurative language, such as the library becoming "a mouth, chewing the silence into something sweet," is consistently fresh and purposeful. The piece is free of any scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating superior line-level craft where every sentence propels the narrative forward with clarity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous and impeccably controlled, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, such as the palette catching light "like a net for dreams" or ink shifting "like schools of fish." The rhythm is varied and hypnotic, avoiding any template cadence or scaffolding, resulting in a piece that feels both polished and effortlessly vital.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is both original and precise ("ribbon the color of bruised twilight," "winked... sharp as a needle’s eye"), enhancing atmosphere without a single wasted word. There are no loops, no scaffolding, no syntactic monotony; each sentence propels the narrative forward with a jeweler's precision. The final lines land with the quiet resonance of a perfectly struck chime.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic variation, and powerful, unmixed metaphors ("glass bones and iron ribs," "split like a wishbone"). There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every sentence drives the narrative forward. The clarity and precision of the language, especially during the climactic sequence, are flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, rhythmic variation, and powerful, precise figurative language. Nearly every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or plot. There are no wasted words or scaffolding. The prose is both beautiful and functional, demonstrating a rare level of polish and control.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and syntax. Information density is consistently high, with nearly every sentence performing multiple functions. While the language is highly figurative, it builds a coherent atmosphere rather than feeling overwrought. The momentum is propulsive and the craft is virtually free of any loops, scaffold, or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with high information density in every line. Figurative language, such as the lamp's flame "bending like a held breath," is both beautiful and purposeful, heightening atmosphere without overwriting. The syntax varies to control momentum, building to the climax and settling into a new rhythm at the end. There are zero technical artifacts to disrupt the story's immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with almost every line performing multiple functions. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as the henge's hum being "the echo of a door swinging open." There is a slight tendency toward thematic summary in the final third (e.g., "The unknown wasn’t a void. It was a conversation."), but it reads as an earned, internal epiphany rather than an authorial intrusion, so the impact is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, striking imagery, and syntactic variety. Sentences like "The cost of light wasn’t the burning. It was the shadow left behind" demonstrate a powerful command of concision and rhythm. The prose is clean, with no discernible scaffolding or repetitive patterns, allowing the story's momentum to build unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by high information density, striking figurative language ("a chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby"), and a controlled, evocative rhythm. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to build atmosphere or advance the plot. The line-level craft is precise and powerful, particularly in the high-pressure climax, where clarity and propulsion are maintained without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong, specific verbs and evocative figurative language that feels integral, not decorative. There are no wasted words or repetitive sentence structures; the rhythm is controlled and purposeful, especially in the final paragraphs. The concluding lines—"But cold, she decided, was just the price of seeing clearly. And clarity? Clarity was worth every frozen step"—are a masterclass in cadence and thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose demonstrates high information density and rhythmic control, with figurative language that is both vivid and purposeful. Lines like "the way stratus layers frayed at the edges, unraveling" do double duty, describing a cloud formation while reinforcing the central theme of threads and wholeness. The syntax is varied and propulsive, carrying the lyrical tone without succumbing to overwriting, even in its most heightened moments.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with no wasted words or motion. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, as in "like trying to catch smoke in a net" or "a river of gold fracturing against the glass." The sentence and paragraph structure create a deliberate, hypnotic rhythm that carries the narrative forward without a single misstep or line-level artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with strong imagery and rhythmic control from the opening sentence. The language is consistently clear and concise. The final few paragraphs, while thematically resonant, engage in a slight amount of repetitive reinforcement of the "luminous" future, which marginally slows the momentum of an otherwise crisp ending.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, varied sentence structure, and precise, evocative language ("gummed with something darker than rust—memories, maybe"). The prose is free of any loops, scaffolding, or overwriting, demonstrating a masterful control of rhythm and momentum. Every sentence serves a purpose, contributing to a polished and impactful whole.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and dense with purpose-driven imagery. The language is highly figurative but remains clear and controlled, establishing a mythic tone without becoming overwrought. There are no notable loops or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet every image serves to build the story's unique logic and atmosphere without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity. The line-level craft is exceptional, with varied sentence structures creating a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through to the end. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; the information density is high and every line propels the narrative forward.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density. Lines like "its ink the color of old bruises" and "a trail of graceless beauty" are both evocative and efficient. The read-aloud rhythm is excellent, with varied sentence structures that support the story’s momentum. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or the advancement of Liora's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with figurative language that is both original and thematically coherent (e.g., "composer writing in haste," "forgotten sheet music"). The rhythm is controlled, and every sentence works to advance the story's accumulative emotional effect. A slight deduction is made for the moment the "symphonically minded brain" is labeled, which tells the reader an idea that was already being shown effectively through metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose contains moments of beauty and precision, particularly in the opening and the description of the central action. However, the final section suffers from noticeable prose artifacts, including conceptual loops and a repetitive, declarative sentence structure ("It always did," "It was always the same"). This creates a choppy, didactic rhythm that detracts from the lyrical quality established earlier and dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with high information density in its imagery ("fossilized grief," "moon...like a held breath"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's melancholic, ritualistic mood. A slight deduction is made for a few explanatory moments, such as "The pavilion was emotionally contagious that way," which tells rather than shows and briefly disrupts the immersive flow.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is consistently strong, favoring evocative verbs and concrete images over modifiers ("exhaled, sharp as a blade unsheathing"). The rhythm and syntax vary to match the scene's emotional tenor, and there are no discernible loops, redundancies, or scaffolding. The line-level craft is of a professional, immediately publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language, such as the "moon's silver scalpel," is consistently striking and purposeful, establishing the story's unique atmosphere from the first line. Sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, accelerating and decelerating in time with the tension. While the prose is highly stylized and risks ornamentalism, it remains controlled, avoiding artifacts and serving the story's "quaking reverie" tone without sacrificing clarity at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is highly polished, with evocative, muscular prose and high information density. Sentences like "loose pebbles floated like startled fish" and "the air ripped—not like fabric, but like a held note suddenly released" demonstrate precision and power. A minor weakness is a rare tendency toward slight redundancy in description, such as "clandestinely luminous," which pulls the score just shy of the exceptional tier, but there are no significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptional—clear, rhythmic, and dense with meaning. Word choice is precise and evocative ("like breath through reeds," "clouded with salt from the oak’s song"). The piece demonstrates mastery of sentence-level propulsion, using varied syntax and deliberate fragments to control pace and mood without a single line of scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and confident, with a strong, varied rhythm that supports the story's melancholic tone. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating vivid images without superfluous language ("Twilight bled into the sky," "a dry sound that dissolved into the twilight"). There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. The final lines, in particular, demonstrate exceptional craft, landing the story's emotional resolution with grace and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The rhythm and syntax support the story's quiet, deliberate momentum. The final two paragraphs, however, become slightly more generic ("mend what had been shattered," "for once, Elias didn’t mind the noise"), losing some of the specific texture that characterizes the rest of the piece and leaning into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic precision, and evocative, original figurative language ("the tide’s slow breath," "her grandmother's voice, thin as parchment"). There are no visible artifacts, loops, or wasted words; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or momentum. The craftsmanship is clean, confident, and demonstrates a masterful control of language.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and propulsive, with strong verbs and vivid sensory details. The rhythm is well-paced, especially in the final sequence of short, impactful sentences. The only minor weakness is a tendency toward direct thematic statement in the last hundred words, which trades some elegance for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptional: clean, evocative, and dense with purpose. Lines like "the wind didn’t gust—it *pulsed*" and "the hum of a tuning fork struck hours ago" are both precise and deeply atmospheric. The piece exhibits outstanding syntactic variety and rhythmic control, with zero evidence of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting. Every word serves the story's momentum and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong verbs and vivid imagery. However, it suffers from a recurring template cadence, particularly the "Not X, but Y" structure ("not to constrain, but to unfetter," "not in protest but in relief," "not as a storm but as a conversation"). This stylistic tic becomes noticeable and slightly artificial, momentarily breaking the otherwise immersive rhythm of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—immaculate, rhythmic, and dense with meaning. Every sentence serves a purpose, advancing the narrative while deepening the atmosphere. Figurative language, like the final note dissolving "like a stone dropped into deep water," is consistently fresh, precise, and emotionally resonant. There are no wasted words or line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense with meaning, rhythmically sophisticated, and free of any scaffolding, loops, or redundancies. Figurative language is consistently fresh, purposeful, and integrated into the story's logic ("constellations mid-collapse"). The piece demonstrates extraordinary precision in word choice and syntax, propelling the narrative forward while maintaining a rich, atmospheric texture. This is flawless, publishable prose.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative. However, the final third relies on a series of short, declarative paragraphs that create a template cadence ("The seeds...began to sing. / One by one, they germinated. / Not into plants, but into *stories*."). This stylistic choice feels overly emphatic and verges on summarizing the story's new magical logic rather than letting the final images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is dense with evocative, specific imagery ("skeleton of light," "swirl a fingerprint of the night’s breath") and strong verbs. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or momentum. Figurative language is coherent and potent, particularly the consistent motif of fractured light and soundless vibrations, which reinforces the story’s central theme and action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and figurative, a high-risk style that succeeds due to its consistency and rhythmic control. While a line like "jigsaw puzzle edges found in rummage sale boxes of the universe" verges on overwriting, the overall effect is hypnotic rather than cluttered. The piece demonstrates high information density and sentence-level propulsion, particularly in the description of the tapestry dissolving into *distance*.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and evocative for most of the story, with high information density in its imagery. However, the final few paragraphs shift into a series of short, declarative sentences ("The orchards would bear fruit. The arches would hold.") that create a slightly clipped, summary-like rhythm. This minor faltering at the very end prevents an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with every sentence serving a clear purpose. There are no wasted words, scaffold phrases, or repetitive loops; the syntax is varied and the word choice is consistently precise. Figurative language, such as the seam snapping "shut like a trapped animal’s jaws," is vivid and enhances the action without becoming overwrought, maintaining clarity even at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous and exceptionally clean, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is both beautiful and purposeful, particularly the recurring motifs of a "held breath" and a "held note," which are paid off powerfully in the final beats. There are no wasted words or distracting artifacts; the sentences propel the narrative with a quiet, confident momentum that is a pleasure to read.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, precise figurative language ("the sky had split like a ripe fruit"). There are no wasted words or scaffolding. The few instances of structural repetition, such as the "They always did" phrasing, feel deliberate and thematically potent, reinforcing the story's cyclical nature rather than reading as a prose artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with almost every sentence serving multiple functions. The figurative language is fresh and precise ("iridescence flickering like a held breath"). The piece is free of distracting loops or scaffolding. A minor deduction is made for a slight register shift in the final paragraphs, where the narration becomes slightly more abstract and explanatory, momentarily thinning the otherwise deeply embodied prose.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language ("brass arms bent like a dying spider," "moonlight pooled like liquid silver"). There are no wasted words or scaffolding. While intensely lyrical, it avoids becoming overwritten, and the clarity of the peak emotional beats remains sharp and impactful. It's a clean, propulsive, and beautiful piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and strong verbs. However, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally risks becoming overwrought, with a few phrases like "the endless night screamed as it unraveled" bordering on melodrama. While the piece avoids significant loops or scaffolding, a slight tendency toward abstract thematic phrasing ("the very fabric of what it had lost") very minorly softens the impact of the otherwise concrete imagery. These are hairline issues in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to control momentum, moving from contemplative stillness to the quickened pulse of the climax. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, particularly the central metaphor of the library as a “nest of contradictions,” which the story fully earns.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, demonstrating exceptional clarity, concision, and rhythm. Information density is high, with lines like "the absence of answers could feel like absolution if you squinted" doing immense character and thematic work. There is a complete absence of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting; every sentence propels the narrative forward with grace and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and dense with purpose-driven imagery. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic effect, creating a propulsive yet melancholic cadence that serves the story's atmosphere. While the language is elevated, it rarely feels overwritten, with nearly every line contributing to world, character, or momentum. A phrase like "the frequencies of a lifetime’s vows singing in his bones" borders on being overwrought but is ultimately justified by the story's mythic climax.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently strong, characterized by high-density, evocative sentences and a confident rhythm. Word choice is precise and imagery is potent ("its chain catching the light like a noose"). The piece loses a fraction of a point for the final two paragraphs, where the prose shifts from showing to a more abstract, summarizing mode. While elegant, this slightly lessens the propulsive momentum right at the end, reading as a moment of reflection rather than pure, imagistic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, striking figurative language, and a strong, varied rhythm. Lines like "petals trembling like static on an old transmission" establish tone and world in a single stroke. There is no scaffolding, redundancy, or overwriting; every word contributes to momentum and atmosphere. The writing is clear, evocative, and propulsive, a masterclass in concision.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and carries a high information density without feeling overwritten. Word choice is precise and powerful, as in "jammed by rust or grief" and "uncorked something feral and bright." The story's rhythm is controlled, building momentum to the climax and settling into a resonant final cadence, with no discernible prose artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with powerful, resonant imagery ("the first breath after a long-held scream"). It demonstrates high information density and strong rhythmic control. The score is held just below the 9.0-band due to a few instances where figurative language borders on being slightly overwrought or relies on familiar constructions, such as "gathered dust like fallen leaves," which momentarily lessens the otherwise unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in its figurative language (e.g., “a bloom—like the unfurling of a note held too long in the throat”). The rhythm is controlled, accelerating and decelerating with the sculpture’s movement. A minor deduction is warranted as the final thematic statements, while poetic, slightly flatten the momentum compared to the purely imagistic prose that precedes them, reading as a moment of summary before the final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and surgically precise. Every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, and plot without a single wasted word or clichéd formulation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm that supports the story's quiet, revelatory tone. Sentences like "The courtyard’s usual chatter...faded as Mira turned the locket over" demonstrate excellent sentence-level propulsion. There are minor instances of familiar phrasing ("painting the cracked tiles in gold and rose") that slightly soften the otherwise sharp and specific language, but there are no significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and dense with purpose, especially in the first half. The language is precise and evocative, creating momentum through strong verbs and specific imagery. The score is held back from the highest tier only by the final paragraphs, which resort to summary and telling where the preceding action had already shown the theme with more power.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and economical, with every sentence carrying weight. Figurative language is consistently inventive and precise, such as memory slipping "like sand through his fingers" or gravity pooling "like ink in water." There are no loops or scaffold; the rhythm is deliberate, accelerating in the chamber and slowing to a somber, steady pace at the end. The information density is high without ever feeling cluttered, demonstrating masterful line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and demonstrates high command of sentence-level craft. However, the figurative language is exceptionally dense, with phrases like "terrestrially cosmic tension" and "tranquil blaze" pushing the boundaries of abstraction. While consistent with the voice, this density verges on overwriting in key moments, slightly impeding the otherwise pristine clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, demonstrating exceptional clarity, concision, and momentum. Every sentence carries weight, blending action, description, and interiority.

The syntax varies effectively to match the emotional tenor of the scene, accelerating into the climax and settling into a powerful cadence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is often luminous and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm and imagery. However, there is a recurring tendency towards overwriting, with dense clusters of figurative language that occasionally threaten to overwhelm the action. The final section also exhibits a summary-like template cadence ("They worked until...", "When the guards found them...") that slightly reduces the story's propulsive energy at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with high information density in most lines. However, the opening paragraphs are slightly overwrought, stacking multiple high-concept metaphors ("serpentine nexus," "sleeping viper," "bioluminescent veins," "universe's secret song," "ribs of the earth") in rapid succession. This creates a momentary density that verges on purple prose before settling into a more balanced rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, dense with imagery that is both beautiful and purposeful, consistently advancing character and theme. Sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, creating a propulsive yet contemplative pace. There are no wasted words or scaffold phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Word choice is precise and evocative ("jury-rigged," "molten cobalt," "bruised purple of a promise"), and the figurative language is consistently inventive and powerful ("bent time like taffy," "the storm outside *inhaled*"). The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, showcasing a clean, confident, and highly polished style from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but occasionally tips into being slightly overwritten with a high density of figurative language. Phrases like "positively wistful" feel a touch imprecise, and some summative lines ("the music box’s stubborn, beautiful defiance") feel more writerly than organic to the moment. While the overall effect is strong, a more restrained hand in a few key places would have elevated the craft from very good to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, with very few wasted words. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful ("cracks spreading like veins," "sunset bled gold").

No significant prose artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.6)

    The prose is outstanding—dense, lyrical, and propelled by strong verbs and concrete imagery. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. Sentence structure varies to control pacing, creating a palpable rhythm that mirrors the story's tension. The final sequence of short, declarative sentences ("The water would come. So would he... He climbed.") is incredibly effective, demonstrating complete control of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, elegant figurative language, and a controlled, evocative rhythm. Sentences like "its gears whispering like a confession" and "rain lashing the cobblestones in a rhythm like a warden’s footsteps" do significant work without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and demonstrates masterful control of language. While the high concentration of figurative language is powerful, it occasionally borders on being overwritten, and the triple repetition of the specific, unusual verb "transliterate" feels like a noticeable authorial artifact. However, the line-level craft remains exceptionally high, with strong propulsion and clarity even amidst the poetic density.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.5)

The final two paragraphs, in particular, are a model of concision and power, bringing the story to its resonant conclusion with flawless rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: precise, evocative, and dense with meaning. Every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or action without a single wasted word or clichéd image. Figurative language, such as the parasol tip being a "divining rod for safe passage," is both beautiful and functional, and the final lines provide a perfect, resonant cadence. There are no discernible prose artifacts or momentum drags.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and high-quality, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-crafted with a compelling rhythm. The score is held just below the 9-band due to a very high density of figurative language throughout ("amber pavilion sagged under the weight of autumn’s gold," "dissolving...like embers in a dying fire"). While beautiful, this consistency slightly lessens the impact of key metaphors in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control on every line. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, as in "stating a fact the way the desert states thirst."

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery. However, the momentum is occasionally slowed by conceptual redundancies, particularly the multiple articulations of the nature of healing. While artfully phrased, these lines paraphrase the same core idea, creating a minor loop that slightly dulls the propulsion toward the otherwise sharp and moving conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both precision and lyricism without a single wasted word. Information density is high, with images like the "chandelier sagged, its crystals dulled by decades of neglect, all but one" doing heavy lifting for plot, setting, and theme. The rhythm is controlled, varying to match the scene's emotional tenor, and the piece is free of any scaffolding or repetitive artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.5)

The prose is clean, avoiding loops or scaffolding, and achieves a literary quality that feels both deliberate and effortless, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and rhythmic variety. There are a few instances where the poetic language feels slightly familiar, such as the "scent of ozone and possibility" or the "Somewhere..." repetition at the end, which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp prose. These are minor flaws in an otherwise pristine execution with no scaffolding or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with figurative language that consistently deepens meaning, such as hope being "a scent—something faint, like crushed lavender underfoot."

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, creating a rich texture with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("reality had folded like warm wax").

The line-level craft demonstrates immense control, with rhythmic variation and no discernible loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, clean, and rhythmic. Every sentence carries weight, advancing plot, character, or atmosphere without a single wasted word or overwrought image.

The piece demonstrates masterful sentence-level propulsion and contains no loops, scaffolding, or other prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating exceptional control of rhythm and imagery. Figurative language is dense but coherent, with similes like "mist like a sleeping serpent" and "flames licking the night like impatient tongues" contributing powerfully to the atmosphere. The line "Liora would call it *Tuesday*" is a bold and successful tonal risk, grounding the mystical proceedings in a moment of human authenticity that deepens character without breaking the mood. The craft is clean, propulsive, and highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)

This is clean, propulsive, and evocative writing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense with evocative imagery and purposeful rhythm. Sentences are crafted for propulsion and atmospheric effect. A few phrases, like "the lock was time itself," lean toward cliché, and the final few paragraphs shift to a slightly more declarative cadence. These are hairline faults in a piece demonstrating a very high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)

There are no discernible prose artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely stellar, with sharp, evocative imagery and high information density. However, the story's primary flaw manifests at the line level: the thematic equation and phrases like "a maze of intentions, a failed equation" are register-breaking abstractions. They read more like an author's notes on theme than the plausible thoughts of this specific, grounded character, creating a prose artifact that slightly dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, a high-risk style that is executed with remarkable control and clarity. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing character, atmosphere, and plot without a single wasted word or clashing metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with high information density and precise, powerful imagery. The rhythm and syntax beautifully support the story's hushed, deliberate pace. The score is just shy of perfect due to a handful of moments where the figurative language is so consistently dense it risks becoming overwrought, and a line like "...leaving it for someone infinitely patient enough to listen" verges on articulating the theme too directly for an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished, with high information density in every line. While rich with figurative language ("sky was a bruise of violet and ash"), it avoids becoming overwrought by maintaining a consistent tone and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, marked by strong verbs and specific sensory details. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward with a confident rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically rich, with high information density in most lines. However, a few key moments lean towards being slightly overwritten, where the figurative language becomes so dense it borders on abstraction. For instance, "the echo of a hundred voices reciting poems at a table long abandoned" is a beautiful but somewhat maximalist image that risks pulling away from the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of an exceptionally high caliber—dense, lyrical, and precise. Images like "a brass teardrop suspended in the hush between ticks" are powerful and efficient. The only hairline fissure is a rare phrase like "oiling its joints with ethical diligence," which dips momentarily into abstraction in a story otherwise defined by its visceral, concrete language.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elegant and information-dense, with evocative and precise word choices ("frayed thread pulled taut," "forgotten violets"). While the figurative language is very rich, bordering on dense, it remains coherent and purposeful, building atmosphere without significantly impeding momentum. The sentence and paragraph structure vary to create a compelling rhythm, and there are no discernible prose artifacts or loops to dull the impact of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in most lines. However, the story suffers from minor conceptual looping, restating the core idea of "innovation vs. prophecy" in several different forms ("not prophecy but innovation," "not about dictating it but listening," "not a blueprint but a conversation"). While stylistically consistent, this slight redundancy creates a faint drag on the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by its rhythmic cadence, high information density, and stunning figurative language. Sentences are crafted with precision, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously without a wasted word.

The piece is clean, propulsive, and polished at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and dense with meaning, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Word choice is consistently strong (e.g., "crystallized," "refracted," "unravel"), and sentence structures are varied to create a compelling rhythm.

Figurative language, such as hatred that "unlearned people," is both original and devastatingly precise. The piece is immaculate on a line-by-line basis.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely luminous, with high information density and fresh, evocative figurative language ("iron ribs rusted into lace"). However, the phrase "shaping its growth through synaptic plasticity" is a significant flaw. This abrupt shift into clinical, scientific register clashes with the established lyrical voice and functions as an expository label in a story that otherwise excels at showing. This artifact in a key transitional beat prevents a 9+ score, as it momentarily breaks the otherwise masterful craft.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is lyrical without being overwritten, with high information density and precise, evocative imagery ("hummed like a struck tuning fork," "raw as honey from a crushed comb").

The final paragraph achieves a powerful cadence, slowing the rhythm to match the world holding its breath.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative. Word choice is precise and imagery is consistently striking ("iron teeth fused by time and salt," "silhouette unspooling into threads of light"). The story demonstrates excellent rhythmic control, especially in the staccato sentences of the climax that build tension before resolving into the longer, more philosophical final lines. While extremely strong, there are one or two moments where the lyricism could be misread as slightly overwrought, but these are hairline issues in an otherwise impeccable piece.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.6)
