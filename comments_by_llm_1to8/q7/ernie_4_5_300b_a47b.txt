  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The opening establishes vivid imagery and momentum, and many lines carry double duty (frost as map, shard as hologram). However, the piece suffers from elevated-diction density in high-pressure beats ("scorched testament," "drifting resonance," "etched her existence") that reads ornamental rather than propulsive, applying roughly −0.5. The final paragraph loops thematically—restating the "pauses" and "hidden maps" concepts without advancing pressure—and several sentences in the chamber discovery beat use parallel "the ledger/the shard" stems that create template cadence, adding −0.3 for cumulative line-level debt.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity is strong and spatial choreography clean. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and technical vocabulary (electrodes, sensors, frequencies) reads plausible. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "silence could be as expressive as sound" / "silently expressive" echo without added pressure; "unshaken marvels" repeats across paragraphs as label rather than evolving image. The phrase "marvel reflected in his: a world where silence could sing" stacks metaphor vehicles awkwardly. Template cadence runs appear in the visitor paragraph ("Scientists and artists visited... Lirael remained wary... Elias stood by her side"). Aggregate penalties for loops and stems total approximately −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is high and no major loops appear, but several patterns accumulate: "His hands, calloused and stained" front-loads modifiers; "each coffin a promise," "each volume a relic" repeats stem structure; "the lens's shard," "the lens's missing pieces," "the lens took shape" cycles the same noun anchor. The climactic paragraph ("The activation was a spectacle") tells the outcome rather than showing moment-by-moment sensory unfolding. Figurative density is controlled—no mixed metaphors—but the final third leans on summary ("Years later...") where scene would charge the closure. Information density is adequate but propulsion flags at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Opening and closing images anchor the piece effectively. Minor loop detected: "donations appeared… donations ceased" and "anonymity dissolved" are efficient summaries, but adjacent beats occasionally restate ("The giver remained a shadow… their movements as quiet as the amplified quiet") without new pressure. Figurative language is selective and voice-motivated ("fear won't feed us. Trust will"), though "amplified quiet" risks becoming a label when it recurs without fresh embodiment. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies naturally and syntax supports scene needs without sluggishness.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor tone. Persistent scaffold and paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "revealing what was hidden, but now she sought to heal" echoes the premise multiple times; "breath remained steady" and breathing-change motifs recur without fresh pressure. Mixed metaphor: "pilgrim of sparks tending flames that burned without fuel" then "trail of unused love seeking its purpose" conflates spark/flame/love without coherent vehicle. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("love, like light, was never truly unused") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a") dull immediacy. Stock phrasing: "foggy lucidity," "testament to unseen forces."

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong figurative language ("edges curled like dry leaves," "bridge arching upward like a question mark"). However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "She'd spent months studying its design, noting how the paths curved...how the hedges seemed to bend light" restates observation without adding pressure. The phrase "disintegration" is used three times in close proximity (title requirement), but the repetition feels mechanical rather than patterned. Stock embodiment ("head spun," "fell to her knees") in the climax dulls immediacy. Information density is high in the opening but thins at closure, where summary replaces scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity holds across most beats, but the piece carries template artifacts: "She'd been here for days, maybe weeks—time blurred"; "The air smelled of dust and forgotten cotton candy"; "a promise she'd made to herself when the wall came down" all read as stock framings. Paraphrase loop appears when "She reached for the keys" is followed by three nearly identical sentences describing key insertion without added pressure. The line "The liberator was unchained at last" summarizes the transformation rather than showing the wrenching action. Mixed metaphor: seeds "suspended in glass vials" then "shimmering like liquid starlight" blurs their physical state.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective. However, the piece displays mild overwriting: "spectral light that seeped through the fractured roof like liquid mercury," "swirls of crimson and gold," "a scream of glass shattering, of promises unraveling" stack figurative language in peak beats without tight causal linkage. Paraphrase loops appear ("the sound of trust breaking" recurs four times with minimal variation). One instance of template cadence: "She pressed… She poured… She added…" structures three sequential beats identically. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, but cumulative density drag warrants −0.6 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and the opening/closing images anchor well, but figurative density is high without always serving pressure: "jar pulsed like a dormant star," "sound like wind chimes," "destiny had just knocked, quietly savvy, and left a lily in reply" stack metaphor and abstraction. The phrase "quietly savvy" appears twice as a tag rather than enacted detail. Paraphrase loops appear ("The thought made her laugh... disrupting the station's silence" recaps rather than advances). Scaffold is minimal, but overwriting in peak beats (the trade, the escape) dilutes momentum. Information density is solid in the setup, thinner at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images (sunlight gilding dust motes, ice pooling in puddles). However, paraphrase loops appear: "Abandonment, he mused, was rarely sudden. It was a slow retreat, a chipping away of resolve until only a shadow remained" restates the concept across two sentences without added pressure. The narrated-task beats ("I now dislodge a rusted screw") feel like obligatory nods to the prompt rather than organic character behavior. Minor scaffold in reflective passages ("He'd always been thoughtfully spirited") summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "phobia-ridden" → "her phobias weren't weaknesses" → "genetic hand-me-downs" restates the same content across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the enforcer beat: "She slid… then shoved… The enforcer stepped… his gun glinting." Stock metaphors ("voice smooth as poison," "stars sharp above") and the therapy-label phrase "vulnerability is power" recur without transformation. Information density is uneven—backstory paragraphs summarize rather than advance present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level craft is competent with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("slow-motion snow," "wave's crest"), but overwriting clusters in descriptive passages: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," "palimpsest of echoes" stack figurative language without clear escalation or pattern payoff. The phrase "retell the silence" and "summarizing a silence" repeat conceptually across adjacent beats without added pressure. Paraphrase loop at "She'd done it. She'd drawn the endless night" (−0.2). No scaffold or template cadence, but density dips in middle paragraphs where reflection summarizes rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual pacing. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The robot's programming had flagged the violin as anomalous, but its newfound curiosity compelled it to investigate" immediately followed by "It set down its broom and extended a claw-like hand"; "Unit-17 realized the violin was a conduit" then "The robot's logic core flickered" restate understanding without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs through several beats ("The robot turned," "The robot played," "Unit-17 stood"). Stock metaphors ("the fabric of time," "the weight of self-awareness") appear without fresh angle. Information density is uneven—some beats compress efficiently while others loop concepts (thoughts as "collisions of memory, emotion, and time" is rephrased multiple times). Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.5), and stock-metaphor (−0.3) penalties totaling −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and most lines carry information, but several artifacts degrade momentum: "ambiguously clear" appears twice as a phrase-echo, "the forecourt's secrets, once locked, now hummed openly" loops the unlocking idea from two lines prior, and the final paragraph stacks summary abstractions ("catalyst," "thawing his mistrust," "bridge," "truth") that paraphrase rather than advance. Template cadence in Lira's exposition ("They're keys. To conversations left unfinished") and synonym churn around "silence/hush/unspoken" across adjacent beats further dull propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering heavier Q7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is generally good; most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening phrase "In the garden maze, where luck became as measurable as the distance between one's thumb and forefinger" establishes voice and premise. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Elara was no ordinary gardener; she was a withered vine dresser" repeats the title-claim, and "These...are not just marbles. They're proof" / "Proof of what?" / extended explanation restates rather than deepens. Template cadence in "She showed him...she did not panic...she redirected" flattens the demonstration beat. Minor pronoun ambiguity when "a withered vine dresser" first appears (character or object?).

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and no major loops. However, several template stems appear ("Her hands found," "She'd done it. She'd proven," "But she knew this was just the beginning") and stock metaphors reduce specificity ("time itself stretch, thinning like taffy"). The opening and closing both lean on "icy warmth," creating a frame without progression. The recalibration sequence demonstrates line-level propulsion, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than advancing through image, lowering momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is generally high; spatial choreography and action order are clean. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates between description and action. Loop/scaffold issues: "in-between spaces" is named twice, once early and again in the penultimate paragraph as thematic echo rather than fresh information; adjacent sentences in the opening ("its cavernous halls," "Amid the hush") both set atmosphere without advancing pressure. Figurative density is high ("lost confessions," "spider silk," "liminal space," "held breath") but remains legible. Template cadence appears in the third paragraph: "She traced... feeling the ghost's presence... The composer had been... Some claimed..." chains exposition without propulsive linkage. Information density is solid in middle beats but the final paragraph summarizes thematic stakes rather than tightening. Minor artifacts present but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops appear: "swaying certainties" is restated across paragraphs; "occupying margins" is explained twice in adjacent beats; "truth had a weight" / "weight of the truth" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("She'd dreamed… and woken… certain she'd forgotten") and elevated register ("celestial shroud," "auroral sorrow") in peak beats create mild drag. No major scaffold or clarity breaks, but density could tighten. Baseline −0.6 for loops and stems, with minor elevation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and spatial blocking is clear. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of a swallowed truth" is declared in paragraph one, echoed in the hologram's line, and restated in the final paragraph without added pressure. Stock metaphor intrudes at peak beats: "dawn bled through the ivy," "a living thing." Filter-verb stack in the climax paragraph ("Elias's hands trembled," "Elias stood alone") dulls immediacy. The hologram's exposition—"We were supposed to shut it down. But we didn't. We… couldn't"—tells rather than shows the mill's collapse. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and stock phrasing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid imagery ("roots dangled like question marks," "soft black sand"). Rhythm varies appropriately, though some passages recycle stems: "The first fold led... The second fold pointed... The third fold guided... The fourth fold led" creates template cadence across the middle section (−0.5). Minor paraphrase loop: "becoming silence, becoming change, becoming nothing and everything" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is strong; no major scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, but the cadence pattern in a high-pressure sequence slightly flattens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears three times; "ordinary magic" and "softly adaptive" recur as unvarying tags. Template cadence runs through the middle section (repeated "Elara [verb], [result]" stems). Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to lean in," "did you—?") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Figurative language ("soft as moth wings," "sound like wind chimes") decorates without advancing pressure. The prose is grammatically clean but informationally thin, with many lines restating prior content ("It's not just hair" / "It's a reminder") rather than tightening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the diary-fragment and symbol-transcription beats. However, scaffold phrases recur: "The dragons' eyes glowed faintly" / "The dragons seemed to stir" and "Elias wondered" / "Elias's breath caught" / "Elias placed his palm." Paraphrase loop in paragraph 4: "The axis shifted" restated as "displaced axis" without added pressure. Template cadence: "He knelt," "He unfolded," "He returned," "He stood" across multiple beats. Apply −0.6 for template runs and −0.2 for paraphrase; total −0.8 from a mid-7s anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.7)
    Information density is high; sentences advance character and atmosphere. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several phrases lean ornamental: "rhythm steady as a heartbeat," "silver blade," "flow of fate like a maestro." The scaffold line "She'd chosen the lighthouse for its isolation, its history of smugglers and spies, and its view" summarizes rather than embedding through action. Minor template cadence in the safehouse paragraph: "The tunnel smelled... She followed... Up ahead..." Sequential actions are mostly clear. Proofreading is clean. The final image—flare into the night—charges the ending, but earlier beats carry decorative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.9)
    Strong figurative density in opening and middle ("time folded like origami," "indigo so deep it seemed to drink the light"). Paraphrase loop detected: "What is silence but the absence of noise?" / "And what is noise but the absence of silence?" restates without adding pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "He dipped…He pressed…He smiled…He turned" across multiple beats without variation (−0.5). Filter-verb stack in climax ("he knew…he saw…he laughed") dulls immediacy (−0.3). Information density high in sensory detail but momentum sags in repetitive loop descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.6)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but the piece carries pervasive paraphrase loops and scaffold: "She was not just a fortune cookie writer—she was a architect of memories, a conductor of ghosts" restates theme without adding pressure; "The fortunes would be cryptic, yes, but they'd also be honest. They'd carry the weight..." lists qualities rather than showing them. Template cadence appears in successive "She'd…" and "They'd…" stems across the final third, dulling momentum. Applying −0.8 for loops and stem repetition in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies across paragraphs, and syntax shifts appropriately between opening imagery and reflective montage. However, scaffold phrases recur: "Mara knew," "The viaduct stretched," "She drifted," creating template cadence in the first third. The tablet "crumbled in her hands, its runes fading to dust" is vivid, but adjacent lines repeat conceptual content ("she didn't need it anymore" restates what the crumbling shows). Figurative density is high ("spectral light," "darkening brightness," "shining thread") without always advancing action; in the montage, metaphor outpaces concrete detail. No major loops or clarity breaks, but momentum sags in the middle where summary substitutes for scene pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, others narrate state without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory anchoring. Information density is high in the cavern descriptions and phonograph handling. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "silence wasn't a puzzle to solve—it was a refuge" echoes "silence isn't empty. It's a container," and the final two paragraphs recycle the hush/silence/breathe cluster without advancing pressure. Minor template cadence in the teaching summary ("She taught them to listen with their skin, their bones, their hearts") and stock metaphor ("thread of quiet that could unravel even the tightest knots") slightly dull the ending. No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative slack prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but several artifacts dull momentum. "Credibly curious" (line 4) and "To nurture integrity in solitude" (line 5) read as prompt labels inserted mid-narrative. "Progressing laterally" (line 6) is announced rather than enacted. The final two paragraphs loop: "He'd always been a recorder of storms. Now, he was something more" is a paraphrase of the log entry just described. Stock phrases appear under pressure: "Her words hung in the air, a storm in themselves." Information density is moderate; transitional scaffolding ("As he neared," "Back in the courtyard") could compress. The closure beat itself—"some truths are meant to be shared, not preserved"—is an over-articulated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple prose artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats: paraphrase loops ("Each knot was a choice he didn't make" / "Each one released a memory—a failed poem, a lost friend, a road not taken"), template cadence in the being's speeches, and elevated diction clashing with urgency ("the gravity of his choices" during peak decision). Filter-verb stacks appear but remain voice-motivated. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching payoff—"tapestry," "loom," "weaver," "threads" appear in most sentences of the climax beat without evolving (Overwriting density penalty: −0.5). Clarity holds, but momentum drags under repetitive metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with purposeful sensory detail and good propulsion through the music sequence. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loop in paragraph one ("scent...after the rainforest burned" immediately followed by "After the rainforest burned, the world had grown quieter") and template cadence in paragraph four ("She was acoustically perceptive, able to hear...This sensitivity had always made her restless, but now it guided her"). Stock metaphor "glass cathedral" and "pool in the hollows" lack freshness. Figurative density is controlled; no mixed metaphors. Information density is generally high, though the grandmother's tune "mend the cracks in the world" adds decorative folksy touch without prior grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence openings and no major loops. However, the piece carries mild overwriting: multiple sentences in the opening beat stack figurative language ("air hummed," "dusk's first sigh," "translucent as old parchment," "warm light of suspended amber crystals") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Some phrases feel templated: "moved through the space with the grace of," "his eyes sparkled with anticipation," "a practiced curve of his lips." Information density is moderate—several sentences describe atmosphere without advancing character pressure. The final paragraph recycles the opening's descriptors ("professionally thorough") and provides thematic summary rather than propulsive closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose carries rhythmic variety and vivid sensory anchors ("gravel crunching," "paper-scented calm"), but several artifact patterns accumulate: "The symphony had ended, but the music lingered" is a stock metaphor; "cycles of compassion" and "silent contributors" loop as unearned abstractions across the final third; the postcard's arrival is summarized rather than dramatized, flattening momentum at closure. Template cadence appears in the opening paragraph's paired clauses and the ledger's "Profit, Unseen" label. The forged letter beat omits Clara's hands-on forgery process, summarizing the key ethical choice. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate theme without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. However, multiple text artifacts lower the score: "boldly sympathetic" is asserted rather than dramatized; "luminescent ache" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment; "webs of kinship" and "tapestry of traders, poets, and wanderers" read as stock metaphor. Paraphrase loops appear ("The orchard's visitors… had dwindled. Loneliness seeped into the glass" restates isolation). Filter verbs ("he thought he saw," "he felt a kinship") slightly dull immediacy in key beats. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting the penalty, but cumulative density issues prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several template-cadence patterns appear: "She reached... she gripped... she closed... she stepped..." and "Lila saw herself as a child... she saw herself old... she saw the giant..." create mechanical parallelism in high-pressure beats without taught pattern payoff. The fissure's voice and the tunnel sequence avoid scaffold, but the opening's "her pencil hovering" → "her fingers brushing" → "her curiosity overpowering" recycles "her [noun] [verb]" stems. Figurative language (silver serpent, loom, threads of light) is coherent but borders on density without always advancing pressure. Deductions for template cadence and stem recycling apply here; total impact −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong; sentences advance atmosphere and action. Some overwriting appears: "the mathematics of emotion lay in such fractures" and the extended reflection on taxidermy slow the middle without adding pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "The loss wasn't a void but a fractal" is restated in slightly varied forms. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("liquid starlight," "veil of grief"). No severe template cadence or filter-verb stacks. The opening and closing images are purposeful. Information density is good in the ritual sequence but dips during backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory detail in the pipe-chase sequences. However, several lines loop conceptually: "sense memory" is mentioned repeatedly without added pressure, and phrases like "her methodical mind" and "her kindly eyes" feel like scaffold labels. The opening's "staining the air a sapphire hush" mixes metaphors (air cannot be stained with hush). Template cadence appears in the cache-patrol routine description. The closure paragraph contains summary ("she was no longer invisible") rather than propulsive image.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with strong sensory detail ("moss swelling beneath her," "tendrils weaving through the moss like veins"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "They're reconstructing" / "By releasing control" is repeated verbatim across two scenes without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in sequences like "She'd built this place... She'd studied plants... she'd spent years..." The phrase "circuitously sincere" appears three times but never dramatized through specific action, reading as ornamental. Some figurative language in peak beats ("their movements not chaotic, but purposeful") tells rather than shows. These artifacts lower density and dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clear with purposeful imagery (e.g., "cliffs crumbled under the moon's indifferent gaze," "a crack in their voice"), but several beats show overwriting: "haggard awe prickled Marin's skin," "threshing meaning from experience," and the stranger's abstract monologue about convergences. Paraphrase loops appear ("the world wasn't a puzzle to solve. It was a conversation" restates the stranger's earlier message). The final paragraph stacks declarations rather than trusting the image, and the insomnia resolution is told rather than shown through bodily change.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("the cave's songs had grown steadily unpredictable, their cadences warping into dissonance, as if unseen forces were tugging"), filter-verb stacks in the opening ("had foreseen," "had waited," "had made," "had grown"), and elevated metaphors during high-pressure beats ("his laughter echoing through the chaos") that drift from Elara's experiential frame. Template stems ("She stepped," "He stepped," "He lifted," "He placed") appear in sequence. Apply −0.8 cumulative in Q7 for these patterned artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several phrases loop: "staggered intervals" appears six times, "exile" nine times, often in near-synonym constructions ("the exile had ended," "pre-exile," "during the exile's chaos"). The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("mosaic," "symphony," "note") in a way that dulls propulsion. Minimal scaffold, but the repetitive emphasis on method terms and the thematic summary at the end reduce line-level tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies, imagery is vivid, and information density is generally high. However, "trembling" recurs excessively (trembling finger, trembling certainty, trembling smile), creating a minor template effect. The metaphor "curdled into legend" and "like the breath of a sleeping giant" are evocative but edge toward purple in adjacent beats. The final paragraph compresses the woman's vanishing and map appearance into summary rather than dramatizing the moment with full propulsion. No major loops or clarity breaks, but peak beats lack the sharpness expected at 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is solid; most lines advance atmosphere or internal state. However, template cadence appears in adjacent beats: "She'd come here to escape… to sculpt space… but tonight…" and "The tile wasn't just an object—it was a bridge. Entangled memories, she thought…" create near-paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("quiet fire," "bridge," "constellation") clusters without muddling clarity but trends decorative in the closure paragraph. No grammar or tense errors; propulsion is steady but not exceptional under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense throughout: "walls bleeding crimson," "defiant moon," "watercolors," "symphony of possibilities," "fractured rainbow." In the storm-peak climax, nearly every sentence carries metaphor without clear pattern-teaching, triggering density penalty (−0.5). The phrase "hushed thunder" appears twice as atmospheric marker but doesn't constrain action. Some scaffold remains: "Kael's mind raced" summarizes rather than showing thought, and "Her voice was urgent" tells emotion already clear from dialogue. Information density is high overall, but the metaphor stack in the final third dulls propulsion rather than sharpening it. Syntax varies adequately and no major loops appear.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loop: "Trust the math, kid" and later "No body. No crime. Just math" recycle the same beat without deepening. Template cadence in the setup: "Her father had taught her... Her father had said... Her father's last lesson echoed." Figurative muddle: ink pot liquid as mood ring, then chemistry, then mind-reading clarity—three incompatible metaphors. The "next hour" summary is scaffold that substitutes for scene. Clarity is mostly maintained but density suffers.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "collect the textures of different times" is restated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in repeated "She would…" and "Each…" sentence openers across paragraphs three and four. Figurative language clusters without coherence: "symphony," "key to unlocking," "door to a realm," "bridges," "tapestry" stack in adjacent beats. The phrase "a torrent of invented histories that seemed to write themselves" is passive and contradicts prior "fervor." Clarity is adequate but density is low, with many scaffold sentences that restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("steel mountains," "bones gleamed in the moonlight"), but template cadence appears in several beats: "He'd been told… but the death certificate… called him," "He found… Its bones… Inside was." Paraphrase loops reduce density: "Errors didn't erase histories; they buried them" restates the prior sentence's implication. The storm sequence maintains propulsion, but "his mind reeled" and "realization hit like a tidal wave" are stock constructions. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clear but carries stock phrases ("dust motes swirled," "breath hitched," "ache in her chest") and template cadence in the climactic beat ("She played on...the hum growing louder...the sound cut out"). Paraphrase loops appear: "reimagining past conversations" is repeated verbatim, and "the riddle wasn't about the stars...it was about harmony" restates the astronomer's earlier line without added pressure. The opening image ("fossilized question") is vivid, but figurative density in the final third ("melody...dissolved into the wind," "pulsing tone") blurs momentum without teaching a pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence variety and clarity are generally strong; no major loops or template cadence. The opening paragraph packs setting, conflict, and the chip's significance efficiently. However, several beats rely on summary where scene would sharpen: "Over the next week, Lira reorganized the carnival's visual language" compresses the central action into a single sentence, losing dramatized struggle. The phrase "dual allegiance" appears twice as a thematic label, bordering on scaffold. The Council's withdrawal ("their barge retreating into the mist") uses soft, generic imagery that dulls the closure beat. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or continuity errors noted.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is generally clear and free of major grammar errors, but suffers from template cadence ("She knelt… She retrieved… She checked… She packed") and paraphrase loops: "the moon wasn't a conquest. It was a mirror" followed by "Her photographs, her messages—they were attempts to outlast" repeats the same thematic claim. Stock metaphors ("carved a silver path," "fleeting moment," "quiet, persistent truth") dull the closure beats. The epilogue's summarized years compress pivotal emotional territory into exposition, and figurative language in high-pressure lines ("spiral of golden gas that danced") trends decorative rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or repair logic. However, minor scaffold appears: "Today was the maiden voyage" and "Her task was to ensure" read slightly expository. The phrase "liquid sunlight" in the penultimate paragraph and "magnetic calm" recur without adding pressure. One paraphrase loop: "He'd taught her to trust the basin's whispers" echoes the earlier setup without deepening it. Prose remains clear and propulsive with no major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with vivid imagery and varied sentence rhythm. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The rivers didn't begin in mountains or springs. They began where the earth's bones shifted" restates without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the trek section: "She packed... She set up... She chipped..." The final paragraph becomes scaffolding-heavy with "Maybe it knew... Or maybe it was..." constructions that hedge rather than close. Information density is strong in the discovery scene but thins in the epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose generally propels forward with vivid imagery ("ivy clawed at weathered stone," "fountain choked with weeds"). However, several lines loop thematically without added pressure: "The wild hush of the ghost town lifted, replaced by a hum of connection" near-paraphrases the earlier "wild hush of forgotten things." The final two paragraphs stack declarative thematic claims ("Balance, once restored, demands nothing less") that tell rather than trust the image. Minor scaffold appears in "Days passed" and "On the seventh day," which function as boilerplate time markers rather than voice-driven transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong with varied syntax and concrete verbs. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Specific weaknesses: paraphrase loop in paragraph two ("hush wasn't empty—it pulsed" / "hush demanded patience" / "hush wasn't just silence") recycles the concept without added pressure (−0.3). The phrase "touches memories" appears as a label without embodied demonstration until the scent-triggered flood. Stock metaphors cluster in key beats ("secrets coiled like eels," "time was a river," "rock in its path") without fresh specificity (−0.4). Information density is adequate but falls short of high-band propulsion due to these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "a swirl of brine and regret," "mosaic of memory and myth," "sound like wind through a keyhole." Several paraphrase loops appear ("he'd already found himself" echoes the prior self-discovery claim; "thread a labyrinth" recurs without added pressure). Template cadence is visible in action chains: "He traced…wondered…stepped…clutched…said." The final third is thick with figurative language that slows momentum rather than sharpening the closure image. Minor pronoun ambiguity when the figure and Elias face each other.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.7)
    High figurative density across most sentences ("shadows pooled like ink," "threads of a thousand funerals," "friction of her eternal restlessness") without pattern-teaching or payoff creates overwriting that blurs propulsion. Several paraphrase loops: "She had carried it through countless rebirths" echoes "bound her soul to the stone" and "vowed to free him" without added pressure. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines ("He had used her, drained her of life… she had cursed him"). The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("some debts transcended time," "awakening… was both a beginning and an end") that dilute the closure image. Stock metaphors (storm-cloud eyes, candle-flame flicker) reduce specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("tide pools lay empty… like exhausted eyes," "corridors twisted like a nervous system"). Information density is moderate; some lines do double work (thread glowing/reacting to voice), but scaffolding phrases ("or maybe minutes—time folded") and minor loops ("not with a chisel, but with thread" echoes the core metaphor without advancing it) slightly drag momentum. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the walk home, which flattens closure. No major artifacts, but concision could tighten mid-section beats.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is high; no major loops or scaffold. However, figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching: "roots twisting like serpents," "coiling around her ankles like living ropes," "pulsed like a heartbeat" cluster without payoff. "Warmly curious" and "cautious enchantment" appear as stock descriptors. The final paragraph shifts to summary telling ("Days passed… piece by piece") that compresses key labor without scene pressure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she'd say," "she felt") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. Information density is high in world-building passages (pre-digital clipboard, surface mail resurgence), but several beats loop conceptually: "before opening the letter, she scanned the margins" and "Using a stylus, she etched the margin's shape" restate the same investigative action without added pressure. The phrase "the arcade's heart" appears twice in quick succession, and "clipboard" is repeated across adjacent lines without functional variation. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she'd spent nights coding," "she'd reverse the process") dull immediacy in a high-stakes beat. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (needles "darted like comets," flame as "star's last breath") is vivid but occasionally dense without clear causal propulsion. Two paraphrase loops appear: "her charts were blueprints of rebellion" restates the earlier "decorative / message" distinction, and the "truth is never what it seems… hidden in the seams" pair reiterates the same concept without added pressure. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 5 ("thought her foolish… saw the wisdom") and template cadence in paragraph 6 ("Zara stood… walked… adjusted… murmured") mildly dull immediacy. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so cumulative deduction remains modest (−0.6 in-band for loops and template stems).

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is generally high with most lines advancing atmosphere or event. Minor scaffold appears: "She'd lost too much to silence, too many words left unsaid" is a paraphrase loop within one sentence. Template cadence in the final paragraphs ("She didn't need to. The spirits' songs faded... but their message remained") uses repetitive declarative stems. The figurative language is mostly coherent, though "wind through church bells" and "roots like ancient fingers" edge toward stock metaphor. No loops obscure causality or dull the closure image enough to warrant harsher penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent beats: "grief and tenderness coiled together" / "lotus-hearted ache" restate the same hybrid emotion without added pressure; "frayed words into bridges" / "translation was about finding equivalence… now alchemy" recycles the transformation metaphor. Template cadence runs: "She'd felt it… She'd taken it… She pulled… She opened…" in sequential paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle logic: "mist curled… like a ghost's fingers," "ocean whispered back." The opening anesthetic reference ("after the anesthetic kicked in") sets a disoriented frame that the prose never delivers—perception remains sharp and lyric throughout, breaking the promised effect. Filter-verb reliance ("wondered if," "realized," "believed") in reflective blocks dulls immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase/synonym loops, template stems, and stock metaphor strings touching multiple beats trigger −1.2 in Q7; anesthetic setup abandoned adds −0.3 for unkept setup. Information density is mid-range; many lines do double duty (coral/cast mirroring) but reflective passages dilute propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and information density. Imagery is often fresh ("fog clung to her like a second skin," "light-words hover in the air like fireflies"). Sentence structure varies purposefully, and the opening/closing bracket effectively. However, several scaffold patterns appear: "She'd [verb]" constructions recur across paragraphs, and some lines restate concepts ("The orchard's silence had seeped into her bones" followed by "turning her art into quiet elegies"). The phrase "pensive mirth" appears three times, twice in close proximity in the final section, creating unnecessary echo. Minor filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she'd expected") in reflective passages, though not severe enough to flatten immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and most lines advance. "The sound wave garden thrived in the hush between noon and dusk" is a strong anchor. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She positioned the nickel… The coin's surface caught… Marisol adjusted the dish's angle" restates setup across three sentences. "Methodically playful" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. The final paragraph stacks summary ("she realized," "all were tools," "a reminder") where a single image would tighten closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and concrete imagery (fractal patterns on the seed, moths forming a living arrow). However, several beats recycle sentence stems ("Elias leaned in," "Elias grinned," "Elias placed") and the middle section loops concept slightly: "converging chaos" is asserted twice in similar phrasing without fresh embodiment. Figurative language (fractal shadows, pulsing seed) decorates rather than propelling causality. No major artifacts obscure closure, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("bioluminescent tides painted the air," "ensconced in the arms of the sea"). Two coherence slips: "hands trembling as if the paper itself might dissolve" mixes agency (hands/paper), and "ensconced in the arms of the sea" at closure feels slightly stock. Template cadence appears in one run: "She described…she'd never dared…her poetry had always been…the postcard made her wonder" (four consecutive "she/her" stems). No paraphrase loops or major scaffold. Information density is high; momentum is steady but not propulsive. Minor figurative muddle and stem repetition prevent entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but overwriting pervades: nearly every beat carries figurative language ("cascade of opalescent static," "tapestry of old and new," "foxglove regret"). Stock metaphors cluster in the final third ("liquid light," "patient as bamboo"). Mixed metaphor appears when "deserted marvels" are said to "pool like liquid light" then "rise." Paraphrase loop: the director says the tube "cannot be repaired," then Lirael realizes "some things…could not be mended," restating without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph four: "She retrieved…She hummed…She returned." Apply cumulative penalty for density and stock phrasing (−0.8) and paraphrase/template run (−0.4); total −1.2 from a ~7.6 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clear with varied syntax and no major grammatical errors. However, several loops and scaffolds weaken density: "symphonies of truth" appears three times, "interconnected promises" twice, with identical phrasing. Template cadence runs appear ("She worked," "She'd been at it," "She packed," "She hung up"). Stock metaphors recur: "heart is a river," "dam it with silence," "river finally unblocked." The restricted-section manuscript reveal and Henrik's perfectly timed midnight appearance read as convenient staging. Information density is modest; several beats (the mead recipe, Cadogan descendant) illustrate method without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "the adhesive held more than residue—it held the imprint" / "measure both distance and deceit" restates without adding pressure; "each measurement, she knew, was a clue" / "each measurement a note in a symphony" recycles the same content. Template cadence in the middle section ("She unrolled... She hummed... She cross-referenced") flattens momentum. Figurative density in high-pressure beats ("dappled resolve shimmering," "volcanic glass," "symphony of decryption") muddies clarity. Stock metaphors ("secrets waiting to be unlocked") appear without transformation. Combined artifacts disallow 9+ globally and pull the score below 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies well; information density is high (meteorite symbols, journal entries, Cairo delivery, Dr. Voss). No loops or scaffold. However, figurative density spikes unevenly: "dust motes swirled...like tiny galaxies," "melody that seemed to shift like sand," "echo...humming in his veins, blooming and withering." The metaphors are legible but stack without pattern-teaching, and the final phrase ("blooming and withering") feels imposed rather than emergent. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the overwriting is concentrated rather than pervasive.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is image-rich and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing lines. However, density issues appear: "featherly determined" recurs as a phrase without evolving meaning; "sacred" and "threshold" loop across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("She followed...She opened...She stepped") flattens momentum. Mixed metaphor: "fractured hush that muffled even the wind" asks hush to both fracture and muffle, straining coherence. The butterfly-effect explanation mid-story reads as exposition rather than discovery woven through action.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory images are concrete ("charred edges," "soft, pulsing light," "pressure of the sea pressed like a gentle hand"). Minimal scaffolding or loops. However, several phrases trend toward stock lyricism: "grand, chaotic symphony of existence," "beautiful work," "patient and enduring." The phrase "rhythm of belonging" appears four times, functioning as motif but nearing repetition without reweighting. "Shadowseam wonder" late in the text reads as inserted coinage rather than earned image. Information density is moderate; some lines ("She knew the others would carry the memory...") summarize rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and imagistic with strong sensory detail ("oil on water," "liquid light"). Sentence variety is present; rhythm supports atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear ("The seed trembled, and the shard's regret deepened" echoes prior "regret" descriptions), and filter-verb stacks ("She saw," "She felt," "She knew") cluster in the climax without voice-motivated purpose. The final pool sequence lists images rather than propelling through syntax, slightly dulling momentum. Information density is moderate; some lines repeat emotional states without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and description is woven through action. However, several template stems recur: "Lira's [noun] [verb]," "The [noun] [verb], its [noun] [verb]." The phrase "orchestrate serendipity by ordering randomness" appears twice nearly verbatim (paragraph 2 and near the end), reading as paraphrase loop. "Between acts" recurs three times, each time without added pressure. Figurative density is high ("nervous fish," "wind through reeds," "stars above the ocean") but remains legible. These patterns and loops prevent entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "cosmic verse," "obsidian grace," "celestial cloak," "map of constellations." Mixed metaphors appear ("mist that pulsed like a second heartbeat" beside "darkness that shimmered like polished onyx"). Paraphrase loops recur: the fledge is defined three times in similar terms without adding pressure. Template cadence runs ("She was a tide dancer…," "She began her dance…," "She stood…") flatten rhythm. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("the fabric of the garden," "the infinite") clashes with embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery. Information density is solid in the opening paragraphs. However, the piece carries paraphrase loops—"The value in the mundane was not in its ordinariness, but in its potential to transform" restates the established motivation without adding pressure. The final two paragraphs summarize rather than propel, with template stems ("She smiled," "She turned," "She tucked") that flatten momentum. Figurative language ("noctilucent reckonings," "atrium of mist") leans decorative in absence of causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled, but several lines loop conceptually: "He'd bargained his innocence away" and the later elaboration via memory redundantly cover the same ground. "The celestial bodies pirouetted" and similar elevated diction in reflective beats ("celestial dance," "lullaby") verge on ornamental and slightly drift from the grounded opening. No major clarity breaks, but the final two paragraphs paraphrase the transformation ("confront his past...found a language") where image alone could carry the weight. Information density is moderate; some lines do single jobs when they could do two.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing the trial balloon ritual or the grotto's response. No major paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, figurative language clusters heavily in several passages without clear payoff: "liquid mercury," "mathematical glow," "lattice of observations," "vectors," "resonance that lingered in her bones" all appear within a few beats, creating register drift that dulls immediacy. The phrase "as if the rock itself were breathing" and "a mouth about to speak" are near-clichés. The gauge's needle action is repeated across three beats with similar phrasing. Minor clarity issue: "the grotto's air shimmered. Patterns emerged" tells the effect rather than showing the visual change in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but figurative density is heavy throughout ("question mark," "spine of a forgotten map," "mosaic of cracks and growth," "dreams were not separate," "hum in her bones") without pattern-teaching or sharp pressure payoff. Some scaffold remains: "She'd come here to discover" and "Now, with the world reshaped" are expository anchors. The final beat ("The corridor's echo had found its voice") reads as explanatory summary rather than image. Minor paraphrase loop: "Let it burn, she thought. Let it become part of the walls' memory" restates the same intent. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative density without escalation payoff, −0.3 for scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear with varied syntax and vivid images (jasmine/wet stone, locket chain "coiled like a question," bioluminescent forest). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. However, paraphrase loops appear: "she aimed to persuade mirrors" → "persuasion required patience"; "borrowed heartbeat thrummed" is repeated across paragraphs; "mirage painter" label recurs without fresh angle. Template cadence surfaces in the mirror sequence: "The first mirror... began to glow. / The second mirror... flickered next. / By the third mirror..." The "perceptively calm" phrase is stock and appears twice. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in the middle third, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and concision are generally strong, with good information density. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of her task" is restated multiple times, and "the price of redemption" recurs in near-identical phrasing across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in repeated "Elara [verb]" sentence stems. Stock phrases weaken peak beats: "her heart heavy yet hopeful," "weary resignation," "the fragile line between peace and ruin." Metaphor density ("fragile balance," "slow dance," "bridge between enmity and hope") approaches overwriting without clear pattern payoff. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, −0.4 for stock metaphor strings.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively between long atmospheric builds ("The salt flat stretched endlessly, a blank canvas save for the fissures that spiraled like ancient scripts") and short declarative beats ("He turned to leave, then paused"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. However, paraphrase loops appear: the bird's song is described as "haunting his childhood" early, then "the bird's call looping in his private study" mid-story, then "he heard the bird's song" near the end—three restatements of the same content without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence in the mansion paragraph: "He'd play... He'd drink... He'd already moved on" (−0.3). Stock phrasing: "blank canvas," "monument to extinction" (−0.2). Total artifacts −0.9 in Q7; no touch to closure beat, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language creates atmosphere, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffolding. "She moved with deliberate grace, each step a sonnet, each gesture a verse" restates the same idea across three phrases. "Threads began to glow, their colors intensifying as they loosened" and the following sentence repeat tension-easing without adding pressure. Template cadence in the opening ("Here, in this place…") and stock metaphors ("liquid sunshine," "ghostly fingers") dull specificity. The closure beat avoids major artifacts but the cumulative drag lowers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong images ("rusted crown above the scrubland," "runes...pulsing like a heartbeat"). Two paraphrase loops: the "half-lit epiphanies" vs. "full-blown revelations" and "seedy bars" recur without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle: "He knelt...began to speak...murmured...intoned" stacks similar constructions. The closing paragraph's "through...through...through" repetition reads purposeful but edges toward overwriting. Information density is solid; no major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("hymn," "ghost of its former life," "geometric shadow, a map of loss and hope") without pattern-teaching or escalation logic; metaphors pile in descriptive rather than propulsive service. Paraphrase loops appear: "She had honored… with humility" echoes "the chance to honor" from paragraph two; "bear witness, to remember, to honor" is synonym churn. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph: "She would return… She would continue… She had found…" Final section over-explains rather than trusts image. Information density is moderate; several beats restate the same conceptual ground. Clarity is intact but momentum drags under decorative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and syntax supports scene needs. Information density is high in the opening; the rope ritual slows slightly with scaffold ("The braids shifted, reweaving themselves") that restates what the prior sentence shows. "Technically gentle" appears twice identically, a paraphrase loop. Figurative language is dense in the opening ("serpent," "ghost of a melody," "breathing") but coherent. The final beat stacks metaphor ("chorus of wind and chimes," "song that refused to die") without muddle. No clarity loss at closure, but minor template cadence ("he'd come," "he'd found," "he'd studied," "he'd spent") in backstory paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "decay and renewal" / "decaying directive" / "bunker's decay mirrored the forest's growth" across adjacent paragraphs without pressure increase. Template cadence in the final section: "Somewhere, a directive decayed. And somewhere, a walker transcended..." is formulaic parallelism. Stock metaphors: "time was a river eroding," "cracks where light seeps through," "footsteps echoing in the rhythm of rebirth." Figurative density in most sentences of the hologram and closure beats (storm's fury, diamonds on lashes, path unfold, hymn to walkers) without pattern-teaching or payoff. Register drift into thesis-speak ("transcend," "integrate," "resonate") clashes with embodied detail. Patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, stock metaphor strings, register drift, touching closure beat (−1.7 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.7)
    Syntax varies; rhythm breathes. Information density is high in discovery beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "The tile wasn't magic—it was a lens" echoes prior "mirror" metaphor without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors cluster: "shield against the void's indifference," "wind through reeds," "star waiting for its orbit." Template cadence in action beats ("She knelt, brushing... placed it... clutched the tile") recurs but stays legible. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clear and propulsive in the opening, with strong rhythm ("echoes drowned in silence and even whispers died midair"). Template cadence appears in the visitor sequence: "She stared... then at Lirael. 'Why show me this?'" repeats structurally for Elara and Kael, creating a loop that dulls momentum (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("eyes glistening," "jaw set") and paraphrase near the close ("grace had shifted" echoes prior phrasing without added pressure) reduce density. Figurative language in the final beat ("scars gleaming like stars") is vivid but arrives after the closure choice has already been summarized, limiting its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful sensory detail and varied sentence structure. Two paraphrase loops appear: "Each mirror a portal…" echoed by "mirrors…their surfaces catching…" and "boundaries between…seen and unseen" restated as "boundaries…not to be erased." Figurative density ("shimmer of twilight frost," "viscous liquid…of midnight and memory") thickens without always advancing scene pressure. Stock metaphor ("testament to time's indifference") and template cadence in the collaborative-work paragraph ("Elias melted…The stranger, meanwhile, dismantled…") lower line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but the piece loops conceptually: "mend not just quartz eyes but the fractures between past and present" is echoed by "She'd mended more than quartz. She'd mended a promise, a legacy, a way forward." Template cadence appears in the final third ("She'd done it. She'd mended..." / "And she'd done it using..."). No figurative muddle, but the closing paragraphs stack summary statements that flatten momentum rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("roots anchored in soil that pulsed," "liquid light," "brightened disquiet"). Minor loop: "The orchard's trees bore fruit" → "the orchard's air hummed, and the trees seemed to lean" recycles "orchard" and "trees" within adjacent beats without new pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "She'd done it. She'd inherited the legacy" uses identical stems. Stock embodiment: "breath hitched," "trembling hands." One metaphor wobbles: "edges singed as if burned by a comet's tail" conflates visual char with kinetic tail. Information density is solid; momentum holds. Proofreading is clean. Cumulative artifact weight in peak and closure beats: −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure, but the opening paragraph overloads figurative density (labyrinthine bookstore, no entrance, shifting maze, human-skin tomes, arcane linguist—all in one sentence). Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "disoriented… muttering… collapsed… nursed back to health, trading knowledge" recaps the same rescue beat without added pressure. Template cadence appears: "She adjusted… She scowled… She flipped… She ran." Stock metaphor "struck chord" and "rustling parchment" voice lack specificity. Minor register drift ("acknowledge their ignorance") at a peak beat. Information density is adequate; no causality breaks, but momentum drags during the cipher-decoding exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is mostly clean, but several patterns recur: "She [verb], the [noun] [participle]" stems appear frequently, and the peak garden-discovery beat stacks filter verbs ("saw the woman stitching," "whispering") that dull immediacy. The opening and closing lines anchor voice effectively. However, paraphrase loops are present: "The garden isn't a place—it's a choice. To remember what we've lost" restates the prior beat's insight without added pressure. Figurative language ("vines curling," "colors shifting like emerald and gold") is vivid but occasionally generic. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, others ("memories altered here, but not lost") scaffold without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with no major loops or causality breaks. However, figurative language clusters densely without always advancing pressure: "squeaking like a ghost's whisper," "the very metal yearned to tell a story," "shadows elongated," "words rearranging themselves into a language she almost understood." Sentence stems show some repetition ("She approached," "She placed," "She unrolled," "She stepped," "She began"). Information density is moderate; several beats summarize Elara's thought rather than propelling scene momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is often vivid ("frozen lightning," "razor-edged thing"). However, density suffers from paraphrase loops: "the caves swallowed her voice" is immediately followed by "leaving only a hollow resonance"; "Hush, she murmured, and the caves agreed" restates what the prior paragraph dramatized. Template stems recur: "She pressed her palm," "She pressed the echo chamber stone," "She placed the bloom." These artifacts dull momentum in mid-beats and reduce information density, though the closure image itself remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is clear through most beats, with strong concrete images (jagged crystal, mosaic constellations, humming glass). However, the piece carries paraphrase loops ("the prism's light was never meant to guide ships. It was meant to remind the world…") and elevated metaphoric density in high-pressure beats ("fragile alchemy of hope and memory," "the hush shattered") that dull immediacy. The scaffold phrase "She understood now" signals a tell rather than showing the realization through action, and the epilogue introduces summary-mode redundancy ("Years later, travelers would speak…") that could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is specific ("gelatinous sheen," "jagged line, sharp and unyielding"), yet paraphrase loops appear: "The past is not a straight line. It bends" echoes the surrounding conjecture without new information. Template cadence emerges in the closure sequence: "She smiled, understanding now. [...] She packed her quill and journal, then paused [...] She took a deep breath [...] She descended the staircase." The repeated "She [verb]" pattern across four consecutive beats in the final third triggers a −0.5 deduction. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("tapestry of color," "gravity of hopelessness," "fire spins upward," "shadows bloom") without clear pattern-teaching, creating mild register drift. Sentence openings vary, and spatial choreography is mostly clear. Minor paraphrase loop: "The knot...had been soaked" and "He'd given it to her" restate the mentor's gift across adjacent beats. The closure beat ("she stood, the kerosene knot still burning") is clean, capping non-closure deductions. No severe line-level artifacts, but cumulative density and stock metaphors ("raw and unfamiliar" laugh) lower momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative sentences during reflection and shorter beats during the final exchange. Information density is high in the grotto description. However, paraphrase loops appear: "transition periods" is restated three times in adjacent paragraphs ("liminal spaces," "pause," "transition periods"), and "warmly observant" recurs as a label. Template cadence in the reflection block ("She'd found it... she'd kept it... she'd always done so") suggests scaffold. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short sentences at countdown, longer lyric lines in the trellis), and information density is high in the opening paragraph. However, several lines loop concepts: "intangibly tangible" and "gilded hush" each appear twice with identical phrasing, and "silence" recurs seven times across 750 words without enough functional variation. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph two ("he'd picked up," "silence could feel") slightly dulls immediacy. The phrase "stretching contracted" in the final paragraph reads as prompt-echo rather than earned image. No causality breaks, but scaffold and synonym proximity (flavors/wash over, floated/balloon) reduce propulsion in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops in adjacent lines damage momentum: "The quiet that followed the whistle's death throes" / "The prism terrace was a place of perpetual motion" both summarize rather than advance pressure. "She'd chosen this shift deliberately, hoping the solitude would help her catalyze a solution" is scaffold exposition. Figurative density in the opening (glass-still canal, liquid fractals, storm glass vial, vaulting hush, kaleidoscopic spires) clusters without pattern-teaching, triggering overwriting penalty. Elevated register ("catalyze," "undercurrent," "liminal," "resonance of stillness") clashes with gondola-operator lexicon in peak beats. Template stems ("Elara's role was… Elara believed… Elara smiled… Elara knew") recur across the text. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.2 in Q7; artifacts touch closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm supports scene shifts. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the stairway of ascension" recurs six times across adjacent paragraphs without reweighting, and "the throne was never unclaimed" / "It waited for the one who'd see herself" restates the same insight. The closing paragraph cycles through three reformulations of the lesson without adding pressure. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; no artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so cap at the stated range.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The emptiness had grown heavier" / "she could no longer ignore the urge"; "She had burned bridges carefully" recurs across paragraphs without added detail. The phrase "linking through scars" appears four times, twice as exposition. Mid-story, filter-verb stacks ("She had discovered," "She had erased," "She had burned") dull immediacy. These artifacts accumulate to approximately −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack, and their presence in non-closure beats applies the disallow-9+ rule globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.0)
    Opening line establishes voice and stakes; sensory detail (cobalt, violet glow) is concrete. However, paraphrase loops appear: "concepts become physical" is told in exposition then restated as mushrooms "absorb them like sponges." Stock metaphors ("sharp as regret," "world exhaling") pile without fresh vehicle logic. The phrase "shadowseam wonder" recurs as ornament without defined meaning. Template cadence in adjacent beats ("She did. The bolt clicked. A low hum filled...") flattens propulsion. No severe artifact obscures causality, but density and rhythm sag under decorative load, triggering −0.6 to −0.8 per the loop/scaffold screen.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally strong. However, multiple passages rely on template stems and abstract intensifiers: "as if the machine itself resisted," "a force that could bend time, if wielded correctly," "bridge of intuition," "veil of her ignorance." The final paragraph stacks scaffold phrases ("not a tragedy but a rebirth," "from the ashes of their secrets") and paraphrases the tomb/cradle image already shown. Figurative language clusters without always advancing the beat—"liquid gold" shadows and "seam" phrasing dilute propulsion at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The greenhouse shuddered. The vines outside writhed..." repeats the same event, and "murmured allegiance" is restated three times without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the orchard paragraph ("bark like twisted rope," "blossoms that glowed"). The marionette's "sneer" and "hollow sockets filled with shards of mirror" are vivid, but "shivering bliss—a paradoxical mix of dread and euphoria" immediately explains itself, flattening the effect. The final third condenses heavily (stage → staircase → chamber → field) without transitions, and the inscription mechanic (program pages changing text) is convenient rather than causal. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat (wheat field summary), lowering the score and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; sensory detail is woven through action. Minor scaffold appears: "He'd spent decades here" → "after the emancipation had freed him" is a nested aside that momentarily stalls the opener. The phrase "he felt a flicker of something tactfully hopeful" uses adverbial "tactfully" awkwardly (trait as modifier rather than action). Two instances of "he imagined" in the penultimate paragraph create light synonym churn. Information density is high in the button-examination beats. No loops touch closure, and figurative language (silent tombs, forgotten keepsakes) is moderate and apt, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive through the infiltration sequence. Sentence variety is adequate; rhythm supports scene tempo (shorter beats during the alarm, slightly longer for the lagoon description). Minor scaffold appears: "Mara's breath fogged," "Mara's heart pounded," "Mara's jaw tightened" recycle the possessive-body formula three times in high-pressure moments, flattening embodiment. The puddle-map trick is told rather than shown: "a map suggested by puddle reflections at dusk—a trick her father had taught her" summarizes rather than dramatizing the mechanics or Mara's present use. No paraphrase loops or register drift. Information density is moderate; the relay-station beat (insert key, files copy, alarm, explosion) compresses several moves efficiently. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image but don't recharge prior particulars with new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images (dewdrops, prism atrium) frame the narrative cleanly. Information density is generally high, weaving setting and action without stalling. However, several phrases loop or scaffold: "eerie nostalgia" appears twice, "vested hush" bookends without reweighting, "quietly vivid" recurs as both "glow" and "certainty," and the final two paragraphs include redundant reflections on the prophecy's status. The figure's dissolution sequence is clear, but "its voice was fraying, the code unraveling" edges toward abstract summary rather than concrete image. No major artifact obscures causality, so penalties remain modest, but the accumulation of minor loops and stock metaphors ("dewdrops like scattered diamonds") prevents entry into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clear and rhythmically varied, but several passages loop or paraphrase: "shifted and faded before they could be read" is restated in the monument paragraph as achieving "markings now clear and steady" without showing intermediate failure. "Emerged transformed always" appears three times, twice as folklore summary and once as closure claim, creating thematic echo rather than earned pattern. Filter-verb density is moderate ("she believed," "she knew") but does not stack in peak beats. Figurative language ("branches twisted like ancient veins," "light weaving through the monuments like a thread") adds texture without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is concrete. Minor scaffold: "He'd come here to escape...But today, he needed more" and "He'd expected answers, but the compass offered only questions" are near-paraphrases. The phrase "Uncertainly certain" recurs three times as a thematic anchor but risks becoming a token label. The workshop paragraph compresses transit efficiently, and the final image ("Let it chime. Let it falter. Let it be.") lands with rhythmic control, though some lines lean toward elevated register ("ghost of fertilizer and neglect") that wobbles against Elias's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (long reflective sentences, short crisis beats: "Wait!"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Clarity is strong except for one typo ("a expression"). Minor loop: "kintsugi intentions" appears twice with similar framing. Overwriting appears in figurative clusters ("molten gold that mirrored," "ink into water," "woven from starlight and regret") that slightly slow momentum in the middle beat. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the foundry-to-cathedral shift leans toward elevated diction that edges past Kael's practical alchemist register.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and figurative language ("stone ribs," "wind through reeds") is vivid. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematically—"luminous ache of hope," "faint, persistent light of joy," "healing was not a destination—it was a pursuit"—restating the resolution without advancing pressure. The phrase "modestly fearless" appears twice (opening and close), and the closing summary tells rather than trusts the preceding scene. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She understood now," "She realized") dull immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. However, template cadence appears in the interrogation-memory paragraph ("a flicker…a needle…a voice") and again in the penultimate beat ("the mask, the needles, the lies…the woman, the forest, the strap"), creating list-like parallelism that dulls propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "mathematics of mercy" and "unmeasurable" recur without added nuance across three beats. Filter-verb stack in "he saw patterns…he realized" at the fractals beat softens immediacy. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes well, but mid-story loops and decorative metaphor density ("liquid shadows," "halo of forgiveness") lower information density in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("tapestry of smoke," "anchors of intuition," "woven from translucent silk and iron lattices") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Mixed metaphors appear: "fragments anchor memories" conflates spatial and conceptual vehicles. Template stems recur: "The market's X," "She [verb]," "The fragment X." Paraphrase loops in the final paragraph ("translation wasn't just about words—it was about seeing the threads") restate theme without advancing pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines carry atmosphere but do not propel.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm supports the accumulative build. Information density is moderate: description layers setting, character action, and ghost presence without severe loops. However, two paraphrase instances appear: "The ghosts had been restless lately" followed immediately by "he'd learned to listen to them" (concepts already implied), and "The cracks in the façade weren't just physical—they were emotional, historical" restates the metaphor without added pressure. Stock metaphor "shadows stretch like old, thin hands" and "forms flickering like old film reels" are functional but generic. Clarity remains high; no grammar errors or timeline breaks. Modest line-level craft with minor scaffold drag but no closure-touching artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; no spatial or temporal confusion. The piece shows strong information density in the opening and middle (dew distillation, frost lattices, press rhythms interwoven with world-building). However, the final two paragraphs loop thematically: "rupture was not destruction but transformation," "cryptic purpose fulfilled," "awakening had begun," "promise," "waiting for the next moment" all paraphrase the same resolution without adding pressure or new detail. Minor filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("She believed," "She knew," "They did not know") dull immediacy. No major artifacts, but the closure beat is told rather than shown, reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.6)
    Sentence-level overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "a howling maelstrom of cobalt and violet," "his voice burnished with sorrow," "a fungus of revolution." Template cadence runs: "Once, Kael had fought...now, he fought..." and "The Luminari didn't build this. They buried it...This isn't a relic of their glory. It's a map to their crimes." Paraphrase loops: paragraph four explains the mirror-covering plan, then paragraph five re-describes the execution. The final paragraph recycles the shard/hope/promise triad without adding pressure. Stock metaphors (slow fuse, seed of doubt) dull specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("air thickening into a syrup of sound," "star smothered by ash"). However, overwriting appears in stacked metaphors during high-pressure beats: "the covenant's creed was not just a philosophy but a kind of magic—one that mended not what was torn, but what had never been whole to begin with" adds exposition at closure rather than trusting the image. Minor loops: "the stone's fragments could only thrive where truth was tethered to action" and later "tethering… we realign its purpose" recycle the concept. The final paragraph's explanatory summary ("midnight steals light by convincing us…") tells rather than shows. Information density is high, but some sentences perform thematic work twice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong specificity: "jagged ceiling like a mirror," "soft silt," "low, endless hum." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. One paraphrase loop: "The compass had been left behind, its needle frozen" closely echoes earlier compass descriptions without new pressure. Minor filter-verb cluster in the psychometry beat ("felt the expedition's fear, their excitement, their confusion") slightly dulls immediacy. No major scaffold or template cadence; information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally serviceable, but multiple prose artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loop: "timewoven alliances" whispered, then "old sailors speak of it," then restated as "covenants passed down" within three paragraphs. Template cadence in the portal sequence: "Lira saw herself… a fisherman's daughter, a shipwright's apprentice, a storm chaser" reads as list rather than pressure. Stock metaphor: "storm-tossed," "bruised sky," "turbine-hum." The final paragraph recycles "wasn't just" twice in adjacent sentences. Filter-verb stack in closure beat: "she understood," "now clear in her mind," "she'd scaffold" (−0.5). Artifacts touch the ending; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.7)
    Pervasive overwriting: "the amber pavilion...autumn leaves clung to the latticework like fiery confetti, their shadows stretching long"; "a hymn to the moon's pull, a confession from Elias Thorn about his own fear of being seen" stacks metaphors without clear propulsion. Template cadence in the middle: "She noticed...She'd started...She'd finally understood" across adjacent paragraphs. The summary compression ("Days passed. Mara returned...") and montage ("By summer, the pavilion's murals had transformed") replace dramatized beats with told progression, flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is largely clear with purposeful imagery ("dunes painted crimson," "chamber glowed with bioluminescent fungi"), but several beats loop or scaffold: "The lagoon shuddered. The water rippled" restates the same effect; "temple cadence" appears in consecutive description blocks without variation. Filter verbs cluster in the retrocognitive vision sequences ("she saw," "she also saw"), dulling immediacy. The closure beat—"diary pages now blank"—is clean, so non-closure artifacts are contained, but momentum sags in the tunnel descent where summary replaces scene.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with controlled rhythm and varied syntax. Minor loops appear: "one evening, as the sun dipped" is competent but stock; "the amber bottle, still without an opening" repeats earlier phrasing without adding pressure. Figurative language ("painting the sky in hues of amber and violet") is clean but unremarkable. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but information density is moderate—several sentences advance atmosphere without tightening conflict. Opening and closing lines are competent but not charged with fresh specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language ("defiant green thumbprint," "velvet disquiet") enriches atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. The paraphrase loop in paragraph six—"He saw...He felt...And he heard"—uses parallel stems for effect but borders on template cadence. The artifact "皱纹 (wrinkles...)" in paragraph seven is a clear scaffold error that breaks immersion (−0.4). The final paragraph's repetition of "The roots remembered" functions as thematic callback but adjacent to "he would stay, watching" and "he would transcribe" creates slight synonym churn. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere more than plot.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm supports visual pacing. Clarity is adequate, but several beats carry paraphrase loops: "the vortex inheritance was not a force to be controlled but negotiated with" echoes the prior paragraph's sacrifice logic without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster in the climax ("tunnel of swirling light," "sea of borrowed moments," "green flames"). The egg-crack sequence and seed-scattering beats advance with propulsion, but the vortex dive summarizes rather than dramatizes. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines ("It was like… the shock, the breathlessness, the sudden clarity" / "It was a paradox, a tension…"). No major loops touch the closure image, capping deduction at −0.8 under the artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, repeated syntactic stems appear across the piece: "She'd spent," "She'd never used," "She'd always tracked" create mild template cadence (−0.4). The phrase "credibly curious" in the opening is awkwardly elevated, and "fractal patterns" feels imported rather than organically observed. Minor redundancy: "The bell rang, its tone clearer, sharper" slightly paraphrases adjacently. Information density is solid but some lines ("its arched windows framing storms as they brewed below") ornament without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies adequately, and the opening/closing images bookend with intentional symmetry. However, multiple passages loop or restate without advancing pressure: "the quiet between the chaos, the flourishing stillness that bloomed" is paraphrased across three beats. "Primal elegance" appears twice without evolving function. Abstract high-level descriptors ("velvet expanse," "faded glow of ancient constellations") recur in place of concrete sensory anchors. Information density is moderate—many sentences do one job rather than two. The crater scene's key beat ("For a moment, the world held its breath. Then, the star winked out") compresses causality into inert summary.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean. However, paraphrase loops weaken pressure: "preserve the weight of unspoken words" and "unspoken words were not lost; they were waiting" restate the same concept. Template stems appear in adjacent lines ("He spoke of love, of loss, of regret. He spoke of the beekeepers..."). Stock metaphor ("shards glinting like a star") and the phrase "heart light for the first time in years" are generic. Cumulative minor slips prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Syntax varies purposefully, and figurative language (coil as dancer, mercury as mirror) charges the middle beats. Information density is high in the opening and hatch sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "timelessness wasn't an absence of time—it was a layering" restates the premise without added pressure, and "The texture of time passing wasn't in clocks or calendars—it was in the way objects held memories" summarizes rather than dramatizes. Template cadence runs ("He understood now," "He left the silo," "He'd found") in the final third flatten momentum. Stock metaphors ("pressed against his thigh," "prickle at the base of his skull") and therapy-speak ("texture of time passing") slightly dull immediacy. No grammar errors, but the closure beat loses propulsion to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is mostly clear and fluid with varied sentence rhythm. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "a willingness to see harmony where others saw only fracture" / "harmonized the discord" recurs without added pressure. The phrase "woven dawns" is repeated but not concretely defined, creating slight opacity. Figurative density is high in contemplative beats ("threads spun from memory and light," "voice a bridge between chaos and calm") but does not obscure action. Information density is moderate; some lines reiterate theme rather than advance story.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("liquid sun," "copper on oak"). Two paraphrase loops detected: "The orchard's pillars weren't just stone; they were alive" restates setup already given, and the final paragraph's triple "Somewhere" structure is template-patterned. The copper-wrapping beats are clear and propulsive, but the closing metaphor ("Her last breath was a sigh, soft as copper on oak") mixes vehicle (breath-sigh) with an unearned tactile comparison. Momentum dips slightly in the "Days later" summary before the final scene. Total artifact load: −0.6 for loops and template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with vivid images: "wolf with moth wings," "oxidized copper skin." Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Minor loop: "artificial pilgrimages" and "chemistry of homecoming" are paraphrased without added pressure. Template cadence in the sculpture list ("a figure...a child...a wolf") spans three items without taught pattern. The final line—"a door creaked open"—attempts resonance but lands as generic stock.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong images (hooves sinking into damp sand, petals "flickering like tiny flames"). However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "He'd chosen it… He'd learned… He mixed… He stood…" across consecutive beats. Paraphrase loops surface ("the battlefield was becoming a garden" restates the motivation without added pressure). Several filter verbs ("he believed," "he heard") dull immediacy in peak moments. Metaphoric density is high ("jetty's flowers defied the gloom," "sky bled from orange to indigo") but remains coherent. Minor scaffold and synonym churn lower the score within band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful images: "grooves humming with forgotten melodies," "veins still visible through translucent coating." Sentence variety supports rhythm. Minor slips: "wild hush" recurs without functional shift (paragraph 2, 10, 15), and "distance" appears four times with slight synonym churn ("barrier," "currency," "bridge"). Template cadence in paragraph 13 ("A cylinder spoke…Another riddle") flattens momentum. No major loops or artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and strong imagery (frosted glass, gilded filaments, nebula pulsing). Minor loops appear: "confusion" is named three times in close proximity, and "true north" recurs without evolving meaning mid-story. The metaphor "temporally stretched their perception" and "syrup" dilation are vivid, but "fragments—a laugh from yesterday, a sigh from tomorrow" strains clarity. Opening and closing lines anchor well. Information density is high; no significant scaffolding or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is steady through the climb and swap sequence. Overwriting appears in stacked modifiers and figurative density without pattern payoff: "chivalrous thief," "apprentice of wonder," "sacredly playful," "cautious abandon" all cluster as abstract labels. The final paragraph loops thematic declarations ("guardian of wonder, sacredly playful") and summarizes the arc with scaffold phrasing ("he knew this was only the beginning") that dulls closure. Minor template cadence in action beats ("He reached... He slipped... He approached").

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied. Opening anchors voice and stakes; the chessboard image recurs purposefully. However, several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("unbind the board's secrets" → "unbound the board"), template cadence in the middle section ("She'd survived… she wanted to survive…"), and elevated diction that sometimes clashes with concrete action ("luminous absence" as a closure phrase feels abstract). The final two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize the transformation, dulling propulsion. Line-level clarity remains intact, but density and momentum sag under repeated concepts and scaffold phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is moderate—many lines describe rather than advance dual functions. Minor loops: "the lost language stone" recurs as a label without fresh detail; "her mercury skin" is repeated identically. Figurative language clusters without always clarifying ("edges blurring into liquid," "stardust," "edges softening into feathers") but remains legible. No major scaffold or template cadence. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling, costing momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual texture. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or symbolic texture. However, several figurative constructions cluster without payoff: "second shadow," "woven hush that bound time and silence," "threads split into smaller strands" within the same beat. "Fierce repose" and "winnow" recur but their mechanics remain abstract. Minor paraphrase loop: "The labyrinth's platinum walls gleamed faintly" near "platinum labyrinth etched into the cobblestones" and later "platinum lines etched into the ground." Propulsion is strong but figurative density in the middle third slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing lines carry visual charge. However, template cadence runs appear in the final third: "The truth, refracted, was everywhere now: in the way... in the way... in the way..." (three parallel stems). The phrase "innocently mischievous" is repeated without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("crooked teeth," "slender finger," "storm") appear without transformation. The line "The price of forgiveness, he realized, wasn't submission—it was the courage to let go of the illusion of control" is therapy-speak epiphany that tells rather than dramatizes. Paraphrase loop: "refract a single truth into many" (paragraph 2) / "the truth isn't yours to own—it's ours to refract" (paragraph 6). These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and high-band cap at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template cadence appears in adjacent beats: "She'd been here for weeks… She'd always been bad at this… She closed her eyes… She'd seen this pattern… She'd spent years…" Paraphrase loop: "The charm wasn't for mending the statue. It was for mending her" immediately followed by extended explanation of the same realization. Figurative density clusters in peak beats without pattern-teaching (acid "eating the air like a thief," "million teeth grinding," "storm of gold and glass") creating mild register drift. Stock metaphor "ghosts" and "mirror" dilute specificity. Information density is uneven; some sentences layer (charm-in-ribcage origin, kintsugi explanation) while others loop theme.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is concrete. Two paraphrase loops appear: "The world was fraying, and so was he" is echoed by "cracks in the mirror—and the cracks in his heart"; "temporary eternity" recurs in a way that reads as motif but borders on synonym churn. The scaffold phrase "He'd kept it hidden…a talisman against the tide of time" adds ornamentation without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs in the cave sequence ("He quickened his pace… He stepped forward… He knelt…") but do not obscure causality. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong. However, the phrase "vibrations of intent" recurs five times without evolving meaning, creating a minor loop. "The scent of the garden, the salt of the sea, the ache in her chest" stacks parallel constructions in a peak beat, trending toward list-like cadence. "A silent scream of tenderness" mixes metaphors (scream vs. tenderness; silent vs. scream). "The air hung thick with the promise of rain" and "dawn bled gold" are vivid but slightly stock. Information density is high; no scaffolding or paraphrase loops elsewhere. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong imagery ("skeletal fingers," "pebbles dragged by tide"). However, template cadence appears in the instruction sequence: "*Align the foot with the star's tear.*" "*Weave the static into a rope.*"—each beat follows the same structural pattern (call arrives, instruction given, Mara obeys). Paraphrase loop: "The censer foot trembled in her palm, its weight shifting" / "The censer foot's weight had stabilized" / "the censer foot still spinning"—three variations restating the object's state without advancing pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in the opening paragraph ("adjusted," "believing," "held"). Deduct −0.6 for template cadence and loop, −0.3 for filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "Mara listened, her mind racing" followed immediately by "They reached the hut" elides the walk without compression signal. Stock phrases cluster in the Jorn encounter ("eyes were wild," "voice trembling," "heart sinking") but do not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Information density is moderate; the ledger reveal and final exchange could be tighter. Opening and closing lines are serviceable but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is dense ("bruise-purple sky," "nest of silver and seaweed," "brittle as moth wings"), but several lines loop or paraphrase: "borrowed memories—a phenomenon he'd studied for decades" is restated as "borrowed memories—a forbidden art" two paragraphs later; "Show me" / "She nodded, leading him" / "Inside, the air was thick" is clear but template-paced. The journal excerpt ("I can't live with the weight. I'll trade her pain for mine") lands as tell rather than discovery through action. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("his focus was sharper," "he felt," "he knew") without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. No major artifacts touch the closure image, but cumulative scaffold and synonym churn (gaps, residue, phenomenon) in the middle third trigger baseline deductions in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The chip wasn't just a tool; it was a key to memories" restates the printer's earlier "doorway of decisions" without added pressure. Template cadence in the discovery sequence ("She saw herself...She saw her mother...And she saw the doorway") flattens propulsion. Figurative density is controlled except in the vision beat, where metaphor strings ("shimmering archway," "heat," "mirror") cluster without clear payoff. No major grammatical errors or pronoun confusion; information density is solid outside the loops.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed: "cobalt grotto above clouds stretching like a bruise beneath her feet" places a bruise below when the grotto is above, creating spatial confusion. Paraphrase loops appear ("She waited…Then, a shared exhale…as the first fireflies…flickered to life. They drifted upward…guiding her…She smiled…and resumed her climb") where adjacent sentences restate momentum without adding pressure. Rhythm is generally controlled, but the closure beat ("She turned, her cloak billowing…and began the climb down") compresses the ending into summary rather than a charged final image with line-level payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high: "ember nexus pulsed like a living heart," "suspended like a moth in amber," "light bending into a spectrum…swirling like a nebula." Three similes cluster in the opening and climax without pattern-teaching; the mixed vehicle "palette of resolve" and "density of presence" operate as abstract labels rather than concrete images. Template cadence appears: "She believed…," "She'd already lost…," "She picked up…," "She placed…" across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "To revalue wasn't to discard, but to see anew. To return differently meant confronting the same problem with fresh eyes, unburdened by past failures"—two sentences restate the ledger's method without added pressure. Clarity remains high, but the artifact load in the climax and final beat triggers line-level penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmic with strong imagery ("bruised purples and oranges," "green-eyed monster fed by the ghosts"). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Minor loop: "I'd always been chronologically confused" restates the premise without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the scroll-reading beats: "The scroll read...," "The note beside it read...," "it read..." across adjacent paragraphs. Information density is good; no major clarity loss, but the loops and stem repetition prevent entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied with strong sensory anchors (algae, brass glow, fog diffusing light). Paraphrase loop: "The shop's trembling calm—a hush punctuated…" echoes "gentle tick… muted by fog" without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "tapestry of resilience" in the final beat. Register drift: "humanize the inanimate," "occluded views," "emotional terrain" elevate diction beyond grounded shop-work idiom. The final paragraph stacks summary telling ("She'd unveiled… quiet art… threads in a tapestry") where a single image would carry more weight. Information density is moderate; some sentences paraphrase prior content.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but several passages loop conceptually: the mentor's lesson appears three times in paraphrase ("runes crystallize when stressed," "breath between storms," "held breath is a bridge"), and the scars-as-map/scars-as-stories/scars-as-language cluster recycles the same metaphor across four paragraphs. Sentence openings show variety, and no grammatical errors appear. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "bones had turned to mist" and "platform shuddered" work in context. The paraphrase loops and metaphor churn trigger a −0.6 deduction; otherwise the prose is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening and climax. The prose remains clear through the magical beats, with no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting appears in the metaphor explanation ("Music is vibration. Vibration is energy. Energy can be channeled"), which reads as scaffolding for the reader rather than Clara's natural thought, and "two bruises in the dim light" strains for effect. No artifacts touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "resounding hush" appears four times; "cosmic illusions" and variants recur without pressure shift. Template cadence in exposition ("The Witness's motivation was clear," "The softcover dictionary was more than a book") stalls momentum. Figurative language in peak beats ("star-strewn expanse where thoughts drifted like clouds") blurs concrete action. Sentence openings vary, but density is low—many lines restate theme without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively through the countdown structure, and most sentences advance pressure or atmosphere. However, several lines loop conceptually: the opening three sentences all restate that clocks measure something beyond time without adding new detail. "He'd always thought clocks measured seconds, minutes, hours—but what if they measured something less tangible?" directly paraphrases the third sentence. Filter verb "trying to parse" slightly dulls immediacy. The figurative density is high but generally purposeful, with the razor-edge motif earning its recurrence. Minimal scaffolding otherwise; information density is strong in the countdown sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice cleanly. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third: "She knelt, heart racing. The lantern's heat warmed her palm as she traced…" / "She sat, running a finger over a phrase…" / "She stood, heart pounding, and walked…"—three near-identical subject-verb-gerund constructions within four paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: "The scrawls," Clara breathed. "They're maps." followed immediately by corridor description then "The scrawls had led her here" restates without added pressure. No figurative muddle in peak beats and information density is solid, but the template stems and one loop warrant −0.6 under the Patterned-artifact penalty pack, preventing entry to the 7.5+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "cultivated estrangement... the art of nurturing distance" repeats the concept without pressure. Template cadence in the call sequence (man asks → Mara responds → outcome) flattens rhythm. Stock metaphors ("frayed at the edges," "weaving through the tunnel's hum," "lullaby for the lost") and the phrase "melodically haunted souls" echo prompt language without fresh embodiment (−0.8 cumulative in Q7). Clarity remains high, but density and propulsion sag under ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings are diverse, and clarity is strong. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "small moments held the weight of empires" / "the weight of small moments" / "the covenant's weight...was in the now" recycles the same core metaphor without adding pressure. Template cadence in the second paragraph: "She believed...that a single gesture..." / "The woman in the photo had been..." / "The covenant's renewal had been..." uses similar stems across three sentences. Figurative density is high ("bruise of violets," "roots twisting through the planks like veins," "petals pulsing like tiny hearts") but remains coherent. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.7)
    Opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "choked with ivy" / "overgrown with ivy" / "wall of ivy"; "loneliness" recurs in adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in "She led… She said… She paused…" and "Elias stared… Elias realized…" runs. The conductor's climactic speech uses elevated, abstract diction ("language," "space between") that sits above the POV's texture. Filter-verb stack ("felt a surge," "realized his chest didn't ache") dulls immediacy at closure. Stock metaphor: "static" face, "dervishes" shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("trees hummed," "wrinkle in the land's skin," "time pooled like mercury"), but the final third stacks metaphors without clear payoff: "melody grew clearer," "river's tongue," "map trembled," "memory made flesh" blur into ornamental accumulation rather than propulsion. Several paraphrase loops appear: "his ring absorbed the tree's dialect" / "ring absorbed the river's tongue" recycles structure without added pressure. Sentence openings vary but information density dips in transit passages ("He walked for hours, days"). The closure image ("memory made flesh") is evocative but vague, dulling the final beat's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clear and purposeful, with strong opening imagery ("prismatic shards that prickled") and concise scene work. Rhythm varies, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. The final beat—"the pen felt lighter... its nib humming softly"—carries earned density. However, paraphrase loops appear: "History isn't a line... It's a web" restates the projection's show; "confidently uncertain" recurs as scaffold without new work. Template cadence in Lira's exposition ("You're here to unbend... I edit the why... You edit the what") and the therapy-speak "thresh meaning from experience" lower momentum in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify across the harbor description and action beats. Information density is moderate—many lines advance atmosphere but some recycle concepts (silence as language is restated multiple times without adding pressure). Minor template cadence in the climax: "Kael's signs grew faster… Lira's playing matched his pace." Stock metaphors cluster in the opening ("liquid silver," "whispering secrets") and resolution ("canvas, waiting to be painted"). No loops or scaffold obscure causality, but figurative density in descriptive passages slows momentum without pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple loops and scaffold phrases: "not destruction but translation," "not a tomb... a *garden*," "not a thief or an arsonist, but a gardener." Stock metaphor "holding its breath" and therapy-speak "volcanic tenderness" appear without payoff. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2: "not vandalism but rescue" rephrases the opening's "not destruction but translation." Template cadence in paragraph 5: "In the chamber... In the hall..." Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −0.8 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening: "the auric lagoon under starlight, a place that flickered in his mind like a half-remembered dream" restates the same idea across multiple clauses. Template cadence in the middle: "The hum of the flowers became... the rustle of leaves a..." Stock metaphors ("velvet silence," "patchwork of scars") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the sorrow lift," "felt the lagoon's memories") dull immediacy. The drumming sequence gains concreteness and propulsion, raising the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or template cadence appear. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final image (coin catching dawn light, tune hummed) recharges earlier motifs. Minor friction: "The labyrinth groaned. Containers shifted, their doors slamming like thunder" uses a stock metaphor (thunder) in a high-pressure beat, and "The coin caught the first light of dawn, its constellations shining like stars" slightly over-explains the visual. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; grammar and sequencing are clean. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.1)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but several passages loop conceptually: "silence was a wall, but also a bridge" followed immediately by "a way to let the light speak for her" restates the same idea. "The dock sighed, the water lapping at the pilings like a lullaby" stacks two personifications without adding pressure. Stock phrases appear ("rough as gravel," "old bones," "twin moons"). Figurative density is high in atmospheric beats without always serving momentum. Sentence openings vary, and no major grammatical errors disrupt flow, but paraphrase loops and decorative metaphor reduce propulsion in a piece that already lacks escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Opening line ("In the cobalt library's mist-swirled aisles, where the hush where past meets prophecy lingered like a breath held too long") stacks figurative language and a nested clause without anchoring who or when. Repeated stems appear: "The girl's breath hitched. Her unspoken words softened" and "Clara smiled. The grotto's magic let her hear..." create template cadence in high-pressure beats. Stock metaphors ("starlight," "like a breath held too long," "forests of second thoughts") accumulate without fresh vehicle logic. The phrase "the hush where past meets prophecy" recurs four times without evolving meaning. Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but density suffers from paraphrase loops (e.g., "Her unspoken words vibrated louder" followed immediately by the italicized thought) and scaffolding constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally coherent ("edges crumbling into the ocean like sandcastles"), but several lines loop or summarize without advancing pressure: "The violence that had once defined her world was gone, replaced by the combative tenderness of letting go" restates the prior beat's emotional claim. Stock metaphor strings ("horizon blurred," "weight of the past finally lifted") and therapy-speak framing ("embrace her true nature," "reluctance to embrace") cluster in the final third. The paraphrase loop "She was free" → "someone free" in the closing paragraph triggers −0.4. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but scaffolding phrases ("she understood now," "she knew") pad pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the whittling sequence; each line advances ritual and thematic charge. However, repetitive syntactic stems appear: "Now," "Next," "Finally" structure the process mechanically. Metaphoric density is heavy in early paragraphs (weathered planks "color of old bone," blades slicing sky into "fractured shards," petals scattering "like ash") without always serving immediate pressure. No paraphrase loops or clarity-breaking artifacts, but the turbines' description recurs with slight synonym churn (hum/whine/drone). The spoon-polishing beat—"Polishing is an act of defiance"—crosses into expository self-commentary that tells rather than shows the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and features striking images ("ice crystals hung… like suspended breath," "liquid glass"). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template phrasing: "tremor of certainty" appears three times with near-identical framing, and multiple sentences open with "The [noun] [verb]" patterns. Figurative language is dense and often stacked ("cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush," "living aura," "liquid glass") without clear progression or payoff, creating decorative texture that occasionally obscures momentum. Lines such as "she craved the dissolution of boundaries" and "boundaries began to dissolve" recycle the same concept without added pressure, violating the loop check.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied. Overwriting flares in the opening ("sunlight fractured through molten-glass orbs") and climax ("mural's colors bled into the air, painting the sky")—metaphor density without pattern-taught payoff. Minor paraphrase loop: "canvases were always abstract—swirls of gray and beige" then "hauntingly empty" restates the same idea. Template cadence in middle beats: "He'd long suspected... the reed tongue hummed... the plants shuddered... the ivy curled... the rose's petals unfurled"—five consecutive subject-verb frames. Stock metaphor: "shattered glass" laugh, "like starlight." Scaffold: "After the phoenix, the land's full of secrets" is tell-summary. Artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in high-pressure beats; deduct −0.6 in Q7 for spread, final-third proximity, and template cadence run.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm and no major loops. The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Minor scaffold appears: "The lab's golden shadows" repeats twice as a scene-setter without evolution, and "powerfully gentle" recurs identically three times. Figurative language density is moderate ("whisper," "symphony of contradictions") but mostly legible. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs harm momentum. Information density is adequate, though some lines ("its edges aligning with sensors that hadn't activated in decades") add atmospheric detail without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, line-level artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the curtains of intention" appears as summary in three adjacent paragraphs without added pressure), synonym churn ("mourning jewelry maker" / "mourning jewelry" / "pendant"), and scaffold phrasing ("He realized, with a subdued thrill" / "his heart full of a quiet, burning certainty"). The final paragraph stacks conceptual restatements: "not an end but a foundation—a place to build curtains, to fold cranes, to illuminate the dark" reads as list rather than propulsion. Template cadence ("He had failed... he sought... he'd learned") across multiple beats. Baseline −0.8 for loops, −0.4 for scaffold, routing to Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "silver serpent," "prism splitting the past," "skeleton of culture" cluster in rapid succession, blurring clarity. Paraphrase loops appear ("the crashes didn't erase culture—they exposed its skeleton" followed immediately by "Now we can map it," which restates the same claim). Template cadence is present in repeated "She [verb], [elaboration]" structures. The final third remains comprehensible but momentum drags under ornamental phrasing ("unaware of the loft's quiet revolution"). Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching: "atoms of nostalgia," "ghosts glow," "anguished joy" appear in quick succession, diluting impact. Paraphrase loops are present—"the pagoda's surface shimmered" and "the pagoda suddenly hummed" restate the object's aliveness without added pressure. Template cadence: "She had come… She had noticed… She had pursued…" across multiple paragraphs. The final beat ("She stood, her saffron veil fluttering…") uses stock imagery. Artifacts touch the closure, triggering the −1.7 baseline and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language clusters without building pressure: "coiled at the edge," "touch like starlight," "scattering into a million glowing motes" in rapid succession at closure. Paraphrase loop present: "The shadow is what's left" followed immediately by "So we need to… reshape it?" Minor template cadence in Thalos's exposition blocks ("It's a metamorphosis." / "Of hope." / "This stone was…"). No major loops or scaffolding, but peak beats lean on stock metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong visual anchors (chameleon's scales, velvet cloth, starlight). However, figurative density clusters in reflective beats without always advancing pressure: "ghost's breath," "hinges creaking like a hinge in time," "language of resilience." Two paraphrase loops appear: the "shedding layers" concept is restated across three paragraphs without added nuance, and the "fragility/strength" binary is cycled through multiple formulations. These loops dull momentum in the middle third. The final paragraph edges toward summary ("she'd rebuilt her understanding") rather than trusting the reconstructed tail image to close without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but several passages loop: "The scars weren't just maps of loss; they were bridges" restates earlier material, and the plant whispers repeat similar syntax across beats (*They know*, *Follow the rings*, *This is how it happened*). The phrase "the displaced miracle had finally found its place" in the final paragraph is both a thematic echo and a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed (frost "releasing a hum," sand "swirling like a storm" then "forming images"). No severe clarity breaks, but cumulative template cadence and synonym churn ("trembling… gasping… stumbled") dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high; the opening paragraph anchors efficiently. However, minor loops and scaffolding appear: "The goodbye letters—her grandmother's, the ones she'd found after her death—had mentioned" recaps known information, and "She stood… She closed her eyes… She gathered… She descended" stacks four identical sentence stems in the final third, creating template cadence. The psychometry sequence is vivid but leans on passive constructions ("images flashed," "the scene shifted") where active syntax would propel more forcefully. Figurative language ("lattice of memories," "theater of light") is clear but borders on stock in the genre. No major grammar errors or clarity breaks; proofreading is clean. The final paragraph's lilac scent and building's creak risk symbolic convenience but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "aurora-lit archway loomed like a portal," "eyes like fractured galaxies," "remembered stardust that clung to his memories," "painting of the archway as it might've looked centuries ago" all layer figurative language densely without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. The opening sentence front-loads three subordinate descriptors before the subject acts. Paraphrase loop: "The unspoken words had been here all along, hidden in the stardust, in the aurora's light, in the act of resting not by sleeping, but by listening" restates the theme claim across three parallel prepositional phrases. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "But his mind buzzed… each one a star… He stood… and smiled." Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work but do not advance causality.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is strong ("burnt honey and static," "soap bubble" tower). However, several lines loop conceptually: "to cultivate sparks in the dark, to grow dreams where none existed" restates the same idea without added pressure. "The woman—if she was a woman—smiled, and her presence flickered" and earlier "her form occasionally everywhere" cycle synonym texture. Figurative density is high but controlled; no major clarity breaks. The final beat's plainness ("the sparks, growing") provides effective closure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies; opening and transformation beats carry propulsion. However, multiple filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments ("she saw it," "she understood," "she felt"), dulling immediacy. Paraphrase loop: "The forest is alive because it remembers being wild" echoes the prior brain/neuron metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "She smiled... But she'd return..." reads as scaffold rather than voice-driven closure. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "gears were neurons, steam synapses" works, though "sound of wind through different trees" repeats across three beats without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or journey. Some template cadence appears: "After the leash breaks," "when the last thread...snapped," "a merchant with...a poet...a child" list structure. Figurative language is controlled ("veiled ridgeway shimmered like a mirage," "twilight deepening, wrapping them") but "shoreline lullaby" recurs as a stock metaphor without fresh vehicle. No paraphrase loops or major filter-verb stacks; clarity and grammar are clean. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor scaffold: "Hours passed, or perhaps days—time blurred" tells rather than showing temporal distortion through beat structure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose carries purposeful lyricism ("cobalt fortress under snow," "cloth so soft it seemed woven from moonlight") but multiple figurative constructions verge on overwriting without clear escalation payoff: "shadow's breath," "frozen mercury," "frostbitten hope that thawed the cobalt walls." Paragraphs 3–4 contain paraphrase loops: "The silence that followed was not the serene hush of the fortress but a void, a chasm where sound should be" restates the same idea across two beats without added pressure. The phrase "seraphically mundane" appears twice in identical form (opening and late), reading as label rather than embodied trait. Minor propulsion issue: the staircase discovery beat ("He traced it with his finger, following the logic") tells the realization rather than dramatizing the perceptual shift, slowing momentum at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs: "The library was a labyrinth…each page whispering"; "She moved through…her steps echoing like a heartbeat"; "The pretender's form wavered, his skin peeling away…a construct of magic." Stock metaphors ("burned like a star trapped in her chest," "lies had seeped…like a slow poison") accumulate in peak beats without fresh specificity. Figurative density in the final paragraph ("collapsed gracefully," "sky alive with stars") obscures concrete action. Scaffold phrasing and synonym churn trigger −0.8 in Q7, and the artifact spread disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.4)
    Patterned-artifact penalty: paraphrase loops ("The paths that disappeared were not lost—they were waiting" echoes "the way the paths reappeared"; "atlas page" touched repeatedly without new pressure), template cadence in final paragraphs ("The fossil fuel ban had been... The ocean was healing... And the corals..."), and stock metaphors ("bones in a graveyard," "lighthouse beam") cluster in closure beats. Deduction: −1.0 in Q7 for loops and template runs touching the ending. Simultaneous-action error: "her fingers drumming" while she cross-references lacks clear sequence. Line-level clarity is serviceable elsewhere, preventing a steeper drop.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clear with strong visual anchors—"liquid gold between rusted cranes," "symbols glowed beneath the grime"—and good sensory selection. Yet scaffold and loops accumulate: "Lira's fingers tightened" / "Lira's breath caught" / "Lira stood" / "Lira raised her arms" forms a template cadence, and paraphrase loops appear ("hated it. Silence was a lie" restates the prior sentiment without advancing). Stock metaphors like "fires reduced to embers" and "debris in a dead engine's wake" cluster early without fresh inflection. The closure beat—"a roar. Not of explosions, but of voices"—is vivid, but the final two sentences summarize rather than propel. Information density is moderate; several beats narrate micro-movements (sliding off hull, walking, kneeling) that could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is clean with varied sentence structure and vivid images ("steamed like a cauldron," "flapping like a wounded bird"). Minor loops: "The script's final symbol—a spiral—matched the lock" repeats information already implied by the vault opening. The final paragraph stacks summary: "unsealed a relic," "unsealed a new beginning," "tradition would evolve, not die"—paraphrase loops that tell rather than trust the image. Figurative density is controlled except in the opening paragraph, which front-loads three similes in rapid succession. No major scaffold, but the closure beat needed sharper propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong concrete detail (wind-twisted pines, salt-bleached roses, crumpled photograph edges). Rhythm modulates between Lila's stillness and the flashback's chaos. However, several scaffold/loop issues: "freeze" appears in three separate contexts (trauma response, somatic choice, emotional freeze at photo) without clear distinction; "pearl of stillness" recurs six times as label; "anchor" (verb/noun) loops across five beats. Minor template cadence in opening ("not just... but..."). These patterns dull momentum without obscuring causality. Information density is solid; no major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; figurative language is vivid but dense in stretches without pattern-teaching. "Walls felt too close" / "walls began to close in" / "walls threatened to crush" loops the same image three times without escalation. "Questions rhetorical questions that hung" and "swallowed by the dark" are near-clichés. Some filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") dull immediacy. Clarity is good; no major loops or scaffolding. The final third sustains metaphor density ("threads pulsed," "portrait breathed") without grounding in action, reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with varied sentence structure and sensory specificity (e.g., "liquid night," "fractal spirals"). Minor scaffolding appears: "She stood, the sand shifting beneath her boots" is a neutral action beat that could be cut, and the phrase "consciously wild intuition snapping into focus" mingles metaphors without clarity. The line "Time didn't slow in crisis; it *fragmented*" is a direct thematic statement that slows momentum in a peak beat. No major loops, but cumulative small frictions reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several prose artifacts weaken momentum: "bravely conflicted" as a verb is a strained coinage; "within the blink that follows surprise" is ornamental phrasing that doesn't anchor time concretely; "dizzying quiet" recurs without accumulating pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "The library's echoes seemed to hold their breath" and "the dizzying quiet of the library" restate atmosphere without advancing action. Template cadence is mild but present in mid-section exposition about the Council and rebels. Information density is moderate; some sentences (e.g., the rebels spreading word) summarize rather than dramatize. No major clarity breaks, but cumulative scaffold and figurative excess in non-peak beats lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence variety and rhythm are controlled; no major loops or template cadence. However, figurative density runs high in reflective beats ("mosaic of shattered rhythms," "glittered like fractured starlight," "symphony of containment and release") without clear payoff at closure. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("manifesto," "revolution," "heartbeat older than towers") that blur rather than sharpen the ending image. Stock phrases like "the task of tending" and "values—resilience, patience, the quiet courage" add minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor scaffold appears: "The garden itself was a labyrinth" follows setup without advancing pressure, and "The garden's patterns had stabilized, but the cost was clear" tells rather than shows. Paraphrase loop in the opening (spike embedded → spike's jagged edge driven deep) costs −0.2. Propulsion is steady but momentum sags slightly in the middle exposition of the emitter's mechanics. No major clarity breaks, but information density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence rhythm and strong momentum. Information density is high in the research sequence. Minor loop: "She'd never used it; the nib was a relic" and later "the nib now screwed into a fountain pen" nearly restates the relic-to-tool transformation. Template cadence appears in the headlines paragraph: "Her father's lawyers demanded… Her mother wept… Clara unplugged…" (three parallel constructions). Stock metaphor: "black hole, swallowing truths" is functional but worn. The observatory's "gears grinding like a celestial heartbeat" and "dome hummed" create vivid opening anchors. No major clarity issues, but the figurative density (orbits, compass, horizon, sunlight) in the final paragraphs risks slight overwriting without quite crossing into opacity. Propulsion remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "guilt… guilt of that silence" and "dissonance… dissonance of old guilt" recycle phrasing without added pressure. Template cadence: "The air tasted of ozone and regret… The air smelled of antiseptic and old paper" mirrors structure mechanically. Stock metaphors ("silver quill," "canvas of flesh," "digital ghosts") appear without fresh inflection. The climax—"guilt dissolving into understanding"—summarizes instead of enacting transformation through concrete image. Clarity is adequate but momentum drags through exposition-heavy beats.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentences advance setting or character. However, minor scaffold persists: "She realized, with a start" and "to her surprise" are filter-heavy; "lilac-hued glow," "lilac unease," and "emergent hush" recur without reweighting. Paraphrase loops appear: "The grotto's whispers grew louder, not in volume but in clarity" unpacks itself unnecessarily. Figurative density ("mist clung… like a second skin," "swirling like tiny dancers") is high but controlled. No major loops or template cadence that obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation ("The shadow was gone, and the air hummed…"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "He had not stopped the fire, nor could he undo the past. But he could rename the present…" restates resolve without added pressure; "warm coldness" recurs three times as a label without evolving embodiment. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes adequately. Figurative language ("stars burned like fractured glass," "waves rippling outward") is coherent, though "warm coldness" as a recurring phrase reads more as thematic assertion than felt paradox. Filter verbs ("He saw," "He thought") cluster in retrocognitive passages but remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (sound as color, time as tapestry) serves the synesthetic conceit without becoming incoherent. Two issues lower the score: first, the opening paragraph stacks three subordinate phrases in a template cadence ("A stage ghost… his form flickering… trailing the scent…"); second, key transformation moments are told rather than shown in action—"the timeline knit itself whole" and "the coin's surface now blank" summarize rather than dramatize the mending. Clarity and momentum remain intact, but information density drops at closure when assertion replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high and grammar clean, but paragraph-level loops reduce density: "The geode became a compass" followed by a paragraph detailing meditation; "somatic markers" repeated across multiple sentences without added nuance. Template cadence appears in the week-long summary ("He'd close his eyes, focus…and let…Sometimes he'd sketch…only to realize…"). The phrase "fractally precise" recurs four times, twice in exposition and twice in dialogue, creating synonym churn around the core concept. The final beat ("fractally, somatically, undeniably real") stacks adverbs where a concrete image would sharpen. No figurative muddle, but information density sags in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple prose artifacts lower momentum: paraphrase loops ("The fossil wasn't just ancient; it pulsed with a factually mystical aura" followed by extended restatement of its qualities), template cadence ("She'd found it here... Her mission... depended on"), and stock metaphors (chest tight, pulse quickened, throat tightened). Register drift into corporate/academic diction ("palimpsest," "liminal," "factually mystical") clashes with the intimate scene pressure. Filter-verb stacks in the vision sequence ("She saw... Then, a shadow... The leaf fell") dull immediacy. The final third accumulates summary statements ("She understood now," "She was no longer just") that tell rather than show the transformation. Information density is uneven; the opening third front-loads exposition while the closure rushes through consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.9)
    Syntax varies and figurative language is controlled without muddle. Minor scaffold appears: "She'd always been quietly inspired" restates the attribute rather than dramatizing it, and "The hourglass turner had always believed" summarizes rather than showing the belief tested. Paraphrase loop: "quietly inspired" recurs as "quiet inspiration blooming" without added pressure. Template cadence is avoided. Clarity is high, but information density dips in expository blocks. Propulsion stalls mid-story as Mara sorts buttons without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without taught pattern: "silver hush," "mist…like a second skin," "ink-soaked quill," "temporary tattoo," "void that mirrored her own uncertainties." Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same content (e.g., courage-as-metaphor restated three ways in paragraphs 3 and 7). Template stems recur: "She'd come," "She'd been," "She'd woken." Deductions: density without payoff −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5. The overwriting obscures momentum and dulls the closure image, triggering cumulative penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple text-artifact patterns: paraphrase loops ("The promise of passage was etched into the very stones" / "the palimpsest promise"; "distill complexity into essence" appears three times with synonym churn), template cadence ("He'd always been closely attentive... he'd thought... now he knew"), and stock metaphors ("knife through linen," "dance of silence"). Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("he knew," "he believed," "he thought"). Register drift into academic diction ("percolate through ambient awareness," "spindrift serenity") clashes with scene urgency. Cumulative deductions in Q7: −1.4 for loops, template stems, and elevated diction in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images ("skeleton of a rusted pump," "jagged shadows that danced like ghosts"). However, multiple passages loop or paraphrase: "The oasis wasn't resisting change; it was holding onto a memory" repeats the resistance/choice idea established earlier. "Phototropic to kindness" is asserted twice without dramatized proof. Template cadence appears in summary beats: "She'd come here... to help... That version of her had planted..." Figurative density is high ("horizon bled orange," "time bent like clay," "yellow petals a beacon") but remains legible. The ending paragraph summarizes rather than enacting: "her heart quiet" and "its glow a silent promise" tell closure instead of showing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good. However, several phrases loop or lean on stock metaphor: "quivering hush" appears twice, "with the rhythm of oars in water" is repeated, and "the moon casting a silver path" / "moonlight sharpened the edges" recycle the same visual. The phrase "protected vulnerability hanging in the air like mist" in the penultimate paragraph is abstract and tonally elevated, blurring the concrete image. No major scaffolding or template cadence, but the symbolic language clusters in the closure third, dulling immediacy slightly. Modest −0.6 for pattern repetition and elevated abstraction near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm modulation. However, several adjacent lines restate the same content: "leaving her alone but unbound" followed by "to prove that survival did not require the ghostly chorus of her kin" is a paraphrase loop. Template cadence appears in the opening ("where the shelves swayed…and the ink…shimmered") and elevated metaphor density ("liquid starlight," "smoke," "primordial") in the first two paragraphs without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Deduct −0.6 for paraphrase loop and figurative density in setup beats.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence variety and rhythm support the contemplative tone; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Two paraphrase-loop clusters lower the score: "She'd spent years helping others hide their truths, but her own heart felt hollow" → "Yet none of them rejoined anything. They were just words on paper, left undelivered or read and forgotten" recycles the same conceptual terrain without added pressure. "The spiral, the orbs, the temple—they were all tools to rejoin what had been fragmented" in the penultimate paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the realization. Stock metaphors ("liquid light," "wind chimes," "petal-strewn crown") appear frequently but do not obscure causality. Apply −0.4 for paraphrase loops and −0.2 for metaphor density without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally strong. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The community's dividing" / "chaos was spreading"; "power plays were their language" adjacent to "The cosmos was a chessboard" restates the game metaphor. Template cadence runs in the opening: "adjusted her headphones" / "spent nights decoding" / "showed anomalies" / "She'd seen this before." Stock phrasing at closure—"Let the tricksters come. She'd be ready"—reads as boilerplate defiance. Minor synonym churn ("tricksters thrived on chaos, and chaos was spreading") and scaffolding ("But the next morning") slightly dull propulsion. No single artifact obscures causality, but the aggregate lowers crispness.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is mostly maintained. Several template stems appear: "He'd come... He'd prepared... He'd earned..." clusters in the middle third, creating minor cadence monotony (−0.4). "Prudently adventurous" repeats as a label without embodied action. The organ's "mournful note" and "dirge" paraphrase emotion rather than specify sound or effect. No severe loops touch closure, but density sags in expository beats ("The fallow period had left...") that summarize rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. However, several lines loop conceptually: "Not just feel it. *Understand* it" paraphrases the prior exchange, and "death and life, forgetting and remembering" lists opposites already shown in image. The phrase "furrowed hush" appears twice without reweighting. Figurative density is high but controlled; mixed metaphors are absent. Minor scaffold ("Her motivation had always been...") intrudes once but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is mostly clear with varied sentence rhythm, but several instances of scaffold phrasing appear: "The station's director burst in, his face flushed" uses a stock construction, and "Her fingers traced the edges" opens with a participle that could be tightened. The phrase "spongey gray" is vivid but "sickly green" in the climax is a weather cliché. No major loops or causality breaks, but information density could be higher—several beats (digging, separating pages) narrate process without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The pixelated pattern pulsed, almost alive, like a heartbeat trapped in glass" restates itself, and "scaffold wrap flutters" is repeated without added clarity. Template cadence runs (multiple "He'd [verb]" openers). Filter-verb stack in paragraph 2 ("he'd found," "he'd come," "he'd seen") dulls immediacy. Stock metaphors ("ancient sentinels," "threads of light," "kaleidoscope of colors") cluster in the climax without coherent vehicle logic, violating the overwriting density check and triggering artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level clarity is generally high, with vivid images (ivy-swallowed carriages, fistful of bills into fire). However, paraphrase loops appear: "He'd come here not for nostalgia, but to discover why some paths circle back" in paragraph one is restated in paragraph three ("he wondered if his father had been right") and again in the penultimate paragraph ("He'd discovered why..."). Template cadence runs through reflective beats: "He reached... He began... He'd learned..." across adjacent paragraphs. The final two paragraphs summarize rather than propel, with redundant thematic claims ("He'd found his answer," "some paths... need never circle back"). No egregious artifacts touch the closure image itself, but density sags in the ending. Sentence rhythm is competent but uniform; peak beats (placing the bills, realization of peace) lack syntactic variation to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm supports the contemplative tone. Vivid details (daylily-pressed telegram, silver hair threaded with starlight) create texture. However, loops and near-paraphrases appear: "The stars are mirrors. Share the burden, or lose the map" followed by "to witness, she'd have to surrender her chronicler's detachment" restates the same concept. Stock metaphors ("tide finding its shore," "like melted silver") appear in peak beats. The phrase "a thousand overlapping voices, each whisper a burden offered freely" uses elevated abstraction where concrete sensory specifics would sharpen pressure. No major artifacts obscure causality, keeping the score in mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (cloak snapping = wind chaos; seed's "sickly green light" = corruption + hunger). Clarity is strong; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had come here after the magic trick failed—a ritual meant to calm the lake's fury had only made it roar louder" repeats the same fact, and "guarded…her heart locked behind walls of thorns and silence" / "she felt the urge to unbend" restates the setup. Template cadence surfaces in the vision paragraph: "She saw…She had killed…The memory had been buried…" Figurative language clusters without escalation: "trees twisted like dancers," "vortex…invisible hands," "hunger…living thing," "spores…glowed with…silver light" stack in adjacent beats without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure. Stock phrase "strip her bare" and "finding lost things" recur as scaffolding. Minor filter-verb stack: "she could feel," "she saw," "she had learned."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is lyric and controlled ("time pooled like spilled ink," "sky had been sutured shut"), but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, which flattens rather than charges key beats. Minor template cadence in the middle (repeated "The" + noun openings) and a paraphrase loop ("Chasing isn't heeding" / "she'd learned to heed") reduce propulsion. The climax compresses causality into summary ("the world split open... the labyrinth was gone"), obscuring the mechanism at the moment of highest stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well and sentence openings are diverse. Two minor loops: "walked back through the half-lit corridors" echoes the opening's "half-light" without reweighting it; "fiercely gentle" appears as keeper's dialogue then again in the final paragraph, the second use reading as thematic summary rather than earned image. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high; no major scaffolding or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies; opening anchors cleanly. Information density is high in the cloth-discovery beat. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He'd never connected his past to *Echo Valley*" restates prior exposition, and "The cloth was a puzzle" / "facts didn't explain the ache" cycle similar conceptual ground. Template cadence runs appear in backstory: "After failing publicly—a botched appraisal… he'd retreated here" uses list-like compression. "Toss it? The idea felt like betrayal" is clear but the subsequent paragraph recycles the insulation metaphor without advancing pressure. Deduct −0.6 for loops and cadence artifacts not touching closure, plus −0.2 for one filter-verb stack in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple lines exhibit near-paraphrase loops: "not mere academic curiosity" followed by restating her belief, and the closing paragraph recycles "touching distance" and "analogical thinking" without advancing pressure. The phrase "her kindliness softening the methodical rigor" in paragraph six is scaffold that tells trait rather than showing cost. Template cadence appears in "The arbor, the seed, and the spirit's ghost had all conspired," a list-structure that deflates momentum at a thematic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "The librarian nodded… gestured… replied… said" runs across multiple beats without variation. Stock metaphors ("fear is a tide," "voice like a conch shell") appear in peak beats without fresh inflection. Mixed metaphor: a bamboo creel cannot smelt, yet "the bamboo flared, and the water boiled" conflates fire and water logic. Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("seemed to hold its breath"). Information density is low—many lines restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: "light that wasn't light—a hum beneath the rocks, a resonance"; "a lattice, a network of latent energy"; "not as pain, but as connection." Paraphrase loops in adjacent lines: "The pearl in Elias's pocket grew warmer, its radiance seeping into his veins" → "The pearl's radiance wasn't just light—it was a bridge." Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The pearl/confessions/cave/spiral" followed by verb-of-being. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (pearl placement, spiral activation) obscures causal sequence rather than sharpening it. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7; also disallows 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is vivid and largely clean: "ivy clawed," "green archive," "sluggish, murky with silt." Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with Mara's internal state. Two paraphrase loops appear: "The graffiti wasn't just vandalism—it was a collective guide" closely echoes the prior sentence's "emotional map" insight, and the final paragraph recaps the river metaphor already delivered. Template cadence in the graffiti-transcription sequence ("She moved to the stall door…In the next stall…") flattens momentum. Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong; sentences vary in structure and information density is adequate. However, several paraphrase loops and scaffold phrases appear: "sharp and restless" → "mind that refused to sleep" restates the same idea; "moved faster now, her steps echoing" → "She traced the pattern with her finger, following the loops" recycles forward-motion beats without adding pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "wondered") cluster in expository passages, dulling immediacy. The final beat—"words began to appear"—summarizes the discovery rather than dramatizing it with concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor (velvet hum, moonlight strings, stardust)—creating a lyric texture that fits the accumulative mode but slows propulsion in the middle third. Paraphrase loops appear: "The observatory's velvet curtains stirred, though no breeze dared enter" echoes "The observatory's velvet walls seemed to exhale" without added pressure. Template cadence in the "propagate" beats (whispered, repeated, said one last time) and stock embodiment ("hands trembled," "heart split") dull immediacy at closure. Clarity remains high; the metaphors cohere, but the density flattens momentum per the overwriting check (−0.5 in Q7 for pattern without payoff at closure).

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and most lines advance story or atmosphere. However, stock phrasings recur: "sharp and clear as a bell," "chill of wonder," "slumped forward, exhausted but triumphant." Figurative density is high in the opening ("skyborne grotto suspended beneath the aurora's green-gold glow") without pattern-teaching, and adjacent sentences occasionally loop ("The chip flared… She guided… She worked…"). Clarity holds, but overwriting and template cadence prevent higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Several template cadences appear: "She set… She pulled… She pressed," and figurative density in early paragraphs ("vineyard hush," "liquid silver," "arms outstretched") stacks without all images earning their keep. The phrase "scalloping their edges" is strained as a verb. No major loops or scaffolding, but the final paragraph summarizes theme ("a choice to climb, to forgive") rather than trusting the image. Sentence openings vary; clarity is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the cloak scene (embodied sensation + conceptual weight). Minor scaffold: "It was terrifying. And exhilarating" is a tell-summary that could be cut. The wind-chime description borders on catalog ("cedar, oak, maple" + their tones) but serves the unhooking action. No loops or template cadence. One filter-verb stack in paragraph two ("claimed," "suspected") is brief and voice-motivated. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.1)
    Overwriting pervades: most sentences carry figurative load—"spun silver," "breath of the wind," "mosaic of light and shadow"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalty. Paraphrase loop: "vanishing was not about leaving but about arriving unnoticed" then "see not what is, but what could be" restates without added pressure. Template cadence in opening: "She was… Her hair… her eyes…" Filter-verb stack in trance passage dulls immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("glimmer of it, the first thread"), disallowing 9+ globally and adding −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The pulse wasn't something to be chased or captured; it was a guide" restates "to navigate without moving wasn't about stillness but about alignment" within two paragraphs. Template cadence runs through "He had been trained," "He had learned," "He had always believed" across the opening third. Stock metaphors—"skeletal fingers," "river" for pulse—recur without fresh vehicles. Rhythm is steady but lacks propulsion during the vigil and morning walk.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong verbs, but several artifact patterns reduce momentum. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "He'd come here... when spells were cast... when magic felt hollow" and "The spire trembled... Kael stumbled... the keystone's archway split." Filter verbs ("watching as," "marveling at," "He realized then that") stack in the garden sequence, dulling immediacy. Paraphrase loop: "The spire wasn't just a place of power—it was a mirror" restates rather than advancing. The final paragraph over-explains the theme ("the sacred wasn't hidden in impossibilities...") where image alone would suffice. Information density is moderate; some beats (floating through archway, landing on moss) could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "groaned like old bones," "meteor hush," "grotesque smiles," "oil-shimmer leather," "cerulean for joy, crimson for grief." In the climactic library beat, metaphor stacks without clear propulsion—"swirl of light," "luminous vow made flesh," "language of the heart, written in hues"—creating mild overwriting that slows momentum. Two paraphrase loops: "the color of sound" recurs without added nuance across paragraphs, and "he'd always hidden behind truth" / "afraid to admit what he'd lost" restate the same internal block. Sentence openings vary, and grammar is clean. Information density is moderate; the closure paragraph compresses insight efficiently, but earlier beats carry descriptive weight that does not always advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., coins as both literal objects and symbolic circuit components). However, some phrases loop conceptually: "the backwards prophecy" is explained multiple times without advancing pressure, and "the static bursts" are reframed in adjacent paragraphs ("required patience," "made sense now"). Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "He [verb]" constructions. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "stellar doubt" as a tone element is asserted rather than embodied. Minor scaffold ("For the first time, he understood") slightly dulls immediacy at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences range from terse (*"The observatory fell silent"*) to layered (*"He'd discovered these echoes after finding the old recordings—wax cylinders…"*). Information density is high in the opening and ritual beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: the monsters' eyes "once dull, now glowed faintly, as if awakening" and two sentences later "their forms solidified… scales iridescent… jaws open"—both describe the same visual escalation without adding causal pressure. The phrase "distant intimacy" recurs in the final paragraph without new charge. Minor scaffold phrases like "he'd realized" and "he wondered" dull immediacy. Deduct −0.6 for paraphrase and template stems, capping the score below 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Strong verb choices ("churned," "gasping," "stitch") and concrete detail (driftwood scaffold, bell edges digging into flesh). Minor scaffold appears: "He'd been told it once summoned storms" could integrate more tightly, and "earnestly naive grin unwavering" repeats the trait label. The drip metronome ("Drip. Drip. Drip.") serves rhythm effectively. Information density is high with minimal bloat, though the meta word-count note at story's end is an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong sensory anchors ("boots crunching gravel," "sapphire-hued liqueur label, half-buried in moss"). Rhythm varies and paragraphs breathe appropriately. However, some lines carry mild overwriting: "mirrored hush" and "skin" for the dam's concrete surface lean decorative, and "the land itself held its breath" is a stock metaphor. The phrase "spin stories into shared meaning" appears twice verbatim, creating a small loop. "Sapphire liqueur had been his final act: a drink meant to toast the past, but also a poison" toggles explanation where image might suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful in most beats, but the piece carries recurring scaffold patterns: "She [verb], her [noun]" stems cluster in the ritual sequence, and paraphrase loops appear ("not a force to be seized—it was a permission" immediately glosses "surrender to the beauty of paradox"). The final paragraph stacks filter verbs and reflective summary ("she allowed herself to feel," "she carried that sentiment") that dull immediacy. Information density is generally high, but the closure beat diffuses into exposition rather than propulsive image. No major artifacts touch causality, so deductions remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (bioluminescent veins, liquid silver clouds) enriches without overwhelming. Minor template cadence in the middle: "He moved silently... He repeated the process... one by one" shows parallel stems. Paraphrase loop: "The watcher's burden wasn't just to observe, but to adapt, to revise, to invent" and later "keep watching, keep revising, keep inventing" recycles the triad. The buckle's repeated handling and the node-repair sequence carry information density, but the final paragraph's summary ("But he'd keep watching...") restates rather than advances. No major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive scaffold and loops: "howling through the cracks," "liquid as history rewrote," "like sugar in tea" stack metaphors without coherence. Paraphrase loops abound: "The clone had rebelled, refusing to be erased" repeats the rebellion claim in adjacent clauses. Template cadence: "He'd survived... Now, he clung..." / "The clone mimicked... 'You think...'" runs across multiple beats. The explosion/dust-settling sequence is stock action-movie phrasing. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the numbness retreating") dull immediacy in the climax. Artifacts touch closure (the final "murmured" tag and poetic descent), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and vivid details ("pull cord handle slipping in his sweaty grip," "blisters on his palm") anchor physicality. Yet several beats rely on paraphrase loops: "The conductor's face was mournfully eager… alive with a flicker of hope" followed by "his mournfully eager expression never wavering" restates the trait without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("echoes… bounced like rubber balls," "arms felt like lead") and summary constructions ("the process was exhausting") replace scene-level enactment. The climax—"A burst of light filled the tunnel"—uses abstraction where a concrete image would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is concrete ("rime like ancient ghosts," "blue and smokeless" flame, "ice-crusted soil"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "The mist thickened, swallowing sound" followed shortly by "let the mist seep into her lungs until her breath matched its rhythm" restates atmospheric immersion without new pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraphs: "When she opened her eyes, she stood... The air smelled... And there, at the far end, stood her mentor" cycles identical stems. "Dimensionally homesick heart" recurs twice verbatim, reading like a prompt anchor rather than organic variation. Filter verbs ("seemed to hold its breath," "thought of her mentor") are voice-motivated and sparse. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly, but mid-story scaffold ("She'd promised herself") drifts toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear: "The penny dropped" used identically twice; "almost whole. Almost" creates a decorative echo without added pressure; "bridges collapsed too" immediately after "bridge between chaos and order" is synonym churn. The metaphor "wounded heart at twilight" for the ember nexus, then "embarrassed by its own decay" later, mixes emotional vehicles inconsistently. These artifacts cluster in the first half and touch the midpoint realization, triggering the lower accumulation deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "skeletal hand," "spectral fingers," "shedding like scales" cluster without clear payoff. Mixed metaphors appear: shadows "stretched toward the moon like spectral fingers" then "merging into a labyrinth of steel and silence" conflates vehicle and tenor. Template cadence in the climax: "He laughed... He reached... He stepped back..." runs three identical stems. Paraphrase loop: "The hush wasn't absence—it was potential" in paragraph four echoes "The hush was a language" in paragraph three without added pressure. Deductions: density without payoff −0.5, template stems −0.5, mixed metaphor −0.4, paraphrase −0.2 = baseline ~5.4 before other craft checks.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "spectral grotto beneath a sky thick with liquid starlight," "bioluminescent veins... mirroring the fractured chronology," "their fur glowing with the light of a thousand suns." Mixed metaphors appear ("sliding along a sheet of glass" while wood warps "into shapes that defied geometry"). Template cadence in the climax: "The widow found... the child's pet reappeared... the lover embraced..." Paraphrase loop: "the ferry becomes a bridge" → "The ferry had been a bridge." Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "unsettling, yet peaceful" / "Unsettling, yes. But calm, too"; "thread by thread" / "one thread at a time." Template cadence: "She'd come here to lose herself… she'd found something far more valuable" is a stock epiphany frame. The eruption beat—"thread burst… mirrors shattered… swirled around Clara like a storm"—stacks passive and intransitive verbs, diffusing momentum. Figurative density ("liquid fractals," "fever dream," "eyes like fractured prisms") front-loads the opening without pattern payoff. Clarity remains adequate; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective (cold glimmer, rough edges, faint glow). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph four's "wanted to learn…wanted to feel" and paragraph six's dual uses of "edge geometry" within three lines. Template stems recur ("She was," "She turned," "She began") without taught pattern. Filter-verb reliance ("felt," "looked," "listened") in peak beats reduces propulsion. Information density is adequate but scaffolding ("a sense of," "the beauty of") pads key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, but several runs of repetitive phrasing appear: "The woman looked up... For a heartbeat... Then she nodded" follows a template cadence. The phrase "persistently curious mind" and "incidental heroism" recur as label-only concepts without fresh embodiment. Stock metaphors cluster: "mist curling around her ankles like spectral cats," "voices faint as static," "heartbeat trapped in amber." The opening and closing paragraphs carry propulsion, but mid-story transit through galleries feels padded. Paraphrase loop in the final section: "She'd done what she came to do: protected a voice... honored a love..." restates the prior lines without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive with strong sensory specificity ("moss-slicked concrete," "holographic map flickered"). Minor loop: "crashing hush" appears in paragraph 2 and the final line without clear reweighting between instances. Some filter-verb stacking in the middle ("she'd studied," "she believed," "she realized") slightly dulls immediacy during high-pressure beats. Syntax varies well and information density is high—most lines advance situation or atmosphere. The phrase "star trapped in amber" and "presence" italicized feel slightly over-elevated for the moment's urgency, but don't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.6)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but several patterns weaken momentum: paraphrase loops ("The error wasn't a contradiction—it was a bridge" / "The digital ghost wasn't a curse. It was a compass") restate concepts without advancing pressure; template cadence runs ("He'd tried... He'd carried... He'd seen...") flatten propulsion across multiple beats. Figurative density is high ("ghost of starlight," "digital ghost," "shadow in the code," "whisper in the static") without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking metaphor muddle. Stock phrases like "tattoo," "lullaby," and "compass" appear in climactic moments. Information density is moderate; several beats could be condensed. Applying −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template runs; −0.4 for figurative density in peak beats; total −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The curse was not malevolence; it was a language" / "It was not a prison—it was a mirror" recycles structure without added pressure. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "throat of endless echoes," "skeletal fingers," "crack in the sky," "fault line in the earth's memory" cluster in early paragraphs. "The storyteller's hum climbed higher, piercing the veil" uses stock metaphor at a key beat. Template cadence in the third paragraph ("The diamond grew warmer…She had spent years…It resembled…") stacks similar stems. Deductions: paraphrase −0.2, figurative density −0.4, template cadence −0.4; total within-category −1.0.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is dense ("crushed lavender," "frequency that made glass shiver"), but several beats loop: the arrowhead pulses/warms/glows across three separate moments without escalating function. "Gravitationally playful" and "metamorphose" appear as quoted labels from the mentor without dramatized meaning. Template cadence in the transformation paragraph ("Her hands clawed, her back arched") and the phrase "the garden's gravitational embrace" mix metaphor (gravitational/embrace). The final sentence stacks three abstract nouns (smile, hope, resolve) without concrete image, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. Overwriting shows in the final third: "bleeding gold through the trees," "sound like wind chimes," "swirled into the air, settling on the statues like a curse," "bent double, their branches weeping sap that smelled of honey and memory"—stacked metaphors in rapid succession without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "The orchard shuddered. The trees bent double…" restates transformation across adjacent lines. Template cadence in the climax: "She played…, until her fingers bled, until the locust shell's wings shivered… And then, something shifted." Sequential "until" stems and vague payoff ("something shifted"). No major grammar errors; pronoun references clear. Information density is moderate—many lines do atmospheric work but few advance multiple story jobs simultaneously. The prose is competent and legible but decorative phrasing dulls momentum in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong with varied sentence openings and purposeful rhythm. Figurative density is high ("twilight's bruise," "promises had curdled," "knife through static") but mostly coherent. Two scaffold patterns emerge: "He'd learned long ago..." and "He didn't know what tomorrow would bring, but he knew one thing" are stock constructions. The phrase "brittle hush" recurs purposefully. Minor paraphrase loop: "borders weren't just lines" is revisited in "gaps where promises went to die" without new pressure. The closure paragraph leans on summary ("less like a threat and more like a promise") rather than image alone. No major loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose exhibits template cadence with repeated "misting hush" and ornamental phrasing ("whispering gleam," "silence as possibility") that recurs without evolving meaning. Figurative language is dense but mixed: "crouched like a broken toy," "air hung thick with...forgotten dreams," "edges biting into his skin like a promise" stack without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops appear: "not to mourn the past, but to interpret silence" is restated as "not emptiness but potential." Information density is moderate; many sentences describe without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but the piece suffers from mild scaffold artifacts: "Eleanor smiled" / "Eleanor nodded" / "Eleanor whispered" template stems, and paraphrase loops around "stories as living things" and "the impossible." The midnight sequence accelerates well with short declaratives ("The candles flickered. Books began to shift"), but the floating-manuscript beat relies on stock phrasing ("the air hummed with energy") and the poem's italicized lines feel inserted rather than woven into Eleanor's perception. Proximity to closure (the final "Continue" whisper) keeps the impact moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "a wisp of smoke, a shimmer of heat, a shape that hovered between girl and gull" stacks metaphor without grounding. Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "Her hands… dipped brushes" immediately restated as "she painted not with pigment but with light." Stock phrase "slow-burning ember" and therapy-speak "cipher of longing woven into her own heart" dull specificity. The final paragraph summarizes the entire resolution rather than dramatizing a single image. Figurative density (most sentences carry metaphor) flattens momentum in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is serviceable, but several scaffold phrases flatten momentum: "The first star of twilight flickered into view, a hint given by the universe itself" over-explains; "Elias realized that the idea he had freed was not just hers, but his own" summarizes the ending beat instead of dramatizing it. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("the lock of hair was more than a keepsake; it was a key" / "the ribbon… had faded to a ghostly hue, and the hair inside seemed to shimmer"). Template cadence in the opening ("His name was Elias Vey, though few knew it, and fewer still understood…") and stock metaphor ("threads being pulled from a tapestry") reduce specificity. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so the penalty remains in Q7 at −0.8 for cumulative issues.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("air tasted different—sharper, laced with...brine"), but the piece carries noticeable loops and scaffold: "When habits break, he often thought, that's when the past whispers loudest" is a thesis statement; "The tide was rising, but Elias didn't leave. Instead, he sat..." uses contrastive structure as filler. The phrase "broken stars" and "stolen memories" recur without evolving pressure. Figurative language is dense in atmospheric passages but doesn't always advance the beat. Sentence openings vary, yet information density is uneven—long reflective blocks (Clara's journal, great-aunt backstory) compress action into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and opening imagery is vivid, but several paraphrase loops appear: "the forgotten library stood… Inside, the air smelled… the only sound was" recounts setting without advancing pressure, and "She'd been sent away… not as punishment but as preservation" doubles back on its own phrasing. The phrase "combative tenderness—sharp enough to cut through lies, soft enough to cradle hope" is a tell-then-clarify construction that flattens the effect. The final paragraph ("Then, slowly, she nodded… I'll do it… I'll face whatever comes") cycles through incremental commitment beats that rephrase the same resolution. No major line-level artifacts obscure causality, but density and propulsion sag in expository stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied; no major loops or template cadence. Figurative density is high throughout ("sunlight dripped," "essence of what's lost," "pool churned with frothy white") without clear escalation or pattern-taught payoff. The waterfall's "dissonance" and "radiant hush" function as mood labels more than concrete images. Opening and closing lines frame the arc, but mid-scene compression is light—many beats describe rather than advance with economy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and openings; the prism/starlight imagery is specific. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Each knot held a fragment of a voice, a laugh, a sob" is restated as "a chorus of ghosts pleading to be heard" without added pressure. Template cadence: "She'd been told… She'd found… She'd come… She'd felt…" across four paragraphs. The phrase "accumulated silence" / "accumulates" / "accumulated" recurs five times, risking synonym churn. Figurative density is controlled except for the late cluster of abstractions ("lucid," "awake," "alive").

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Information density is high in the film-comparison and henge-approach beats. Line-level clarity is strong. Minor artifacts: "as if" recurs six times across the story (stones "as if begging," henge "as if absorbing," chapel "as if waiting"), a stock connective that trends into template cadence under high-pressure moments. "The silence enveloped him—not cold, but warm" is a tidy emotional toggle. No paraphrase loops; no major scaffold. Figurative density is high but coherent (tear as threshold, serpents' eyes guarding, suns' fractures as broken halos). Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual interest. Information density is high—most lines advance investigation, character, or atmosphere. Minor loop artifacts: "The library's corridors seemed to pulse" echoes the earlier "time seemed to pool" construction without adding pressure; "not to watch the storm, but to feel the resonance" is effective parallelism but sits close to summary. Figurative density is controlled except in the final third, where metaphors stack ("orbit like electrons," "phase transition," "half-life of memory") without full dramatization. Clarity remains high; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. Technical terminology (440 Hz, ionosphere, quantum decay) reads accurate and voice-appropriate. Propulsion is steady, though the penultimate paragraph shifts into reflective summary that slightly slows momentum before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean, but several moments show decorative phrasing that stalls momentum: "his fingers moving faster now, the charcoal leaving trails like smoke" restates action without advancing pressure. The opening of multiple paragraphs with "The" or "Elias" creates template cadence. Figurative language ("mist curled," "sky flickered like a half-remembered dream") appears frequently in non-peak beats, sometimes blurring specificity. No major loops or causality breaks, but density could tighten by 15–20% without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and imagery is concrete (dust sparkling like starlight, lenses catching light like twin suns). Template-cadence issue: "Mara's fingers brushed…Mara hesitated…Mara picked them up…Mara's chest tightened…Mara tucked…Mara met her gaze…Mara pulled…Mara said…Mara stepped out" stacks protagonist-name sentence openers across ~15 lines, creating a mechanical drum. Figurative language is dense in the opening (gears grinding like a tired heart, clouds thin into wisps, grief like a second skin, symbols swirling like storm clouds) without a taught lyric pattern, edging toward overwriting. Minor filter-verb stack in middle section ("Mara's mind raced…She traced…She adjusted…peering through").

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases lean toward over-written lyricism: "a sea of stars," "mourning veil," "dusty starlight of belief." The phrase "quietly explosive alchemy" appears as a label without embodied consequence. Paraphrase appears in adjacent beats—"empty spaces remember" / "loss isn't an end but a spool"—where the second restates the first without added pressure. No major loops or scaffold errors obscure causality, but figurative density in the final third (the "mosaic of emotions," "ghostly echoes") risks decoration over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    Moderate loop and scaffold issues: "heightened stillness" appears twice (opening air, final "lingered"); "fractally precise" repeated without evolution; "the safe, still hidden, would survive. So would the journal's message" is near-paraphrase. Template cadence in middle: "She'd been commissioned… She saw… She dug… She pressed… She lifted." Register drifts elevated in the final third ("silent hymn to limits overcome"). Information density is good in discovery beats, but the ending paragraph stacks summary: "walked on," "faded behind her," "yet undiscovered." No major clarity breaks, but momentum drags slightly under decorative phrasing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies (short urgent beats during the leap, longer atmospheric passages at the opening), and sensory language is often vivid ("copper hull creaking like a sigh," "liquid darkness"). However, patterned scaffold appears: "Her curiosity had always been her compass" and "Lira's diligently curious nature" paraphrase the same trait within three paragraphs. Filter-verb reliance ("she noticed," "she'd seen," "she said") dulls immediacy in mid-pressure beats. The closure summary—"She'd charted the next great discovery—not just a place, but a truth"—abstracts the earned images (orb, visions) into a thesis statement rather than letting action close the arc. Minor template cadence in Jax's beats: "he said, leaning... he'd seen... he said."

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is maintained throughout. Opening and closing images are vivid and frame the piece cleanly. However, scaffold phrasing recurs: "He'd come to this place," "He'd spent weeks," "He'd traced the final prophecy" stack identical past-perfect constructions in exposition. The final paragraph loops thematically—"rhythm of repair" repeats, and "time, like memory, could always be mended" paraphrases the prior beat's reassurance. Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. Minor template cadence and thematic echo in the closure paragraph lower momentum and trigger −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level clarity is mostly intact, but scaffold and redundancy slow momentum: "never lied, never manipulated, and never asked" is a list; "Her actions were transparent, her motives pure" paraphrases the prior sentence; "their conversations shifting from fear to action" tells what should be shown. The climax compresses causally dense action ("worked for hours… reinforced… secured… chanted") into summary without propulsion. Stock metaphors ("candle flame," "morning frost") and template cadence ("She was not the kind of specter who…") reduce texture.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declarations at the climax: "The lighthouse groaned. The pane of hush began to crack"). However, figurative language clusters densely in the opening and middle passages ("skeletal tower," "spectral glow," "insects in amber," "thread to be gently pulled," "ripples in a pond," "frayed rope," "snow") without all serving distinct functions, triggering overwriting concerns (−0.4). Paraphrase loop: "The end is not an event...but a lullaby sung across a thousand lifetimes" in backstory is echoed nearly verbatim in the closing line, reducing closure sharpness (−0.3). No other scaffolding or template cadence issues; clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence variety and rhythm support momentum; vivid concrete detail (brass eyes, sap like blood, gears spat sparks) carries high information density. Minor scaffold appears: "The birds were already circling" followed immediately by "The birds screeched, diving lower" repeats the subject without advancing new information. "Offhandedly exact" in paragraph two reads as exposition rather than dramatized trait. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No major loops or muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is competent with varied syntax and vivid sensory anchors in the ravine section (froth, eddies, fractal patterns). However, metaphor density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff—"symphonically minded," "unraveled her," "loosened grief"—blurring immediacy. Paraphrase loops: "divergence wasn't an end, but a phase" restates "separation isn't an end." The coda compresses weeks into summary with template cadence ("She designed," "Mara composed"). Therapy-speak ("loosened grief") appears multiple times. Filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("she realized," "she thought") without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good. However, synonym churn and conceptual paraphrase loops appear: "void," "absence," "emptiness," "silence" cycle without added pressure; "glimmering parole" recurs as thematic tag rather than evolving image. The phrase "glimmering parole—a prisoner of its own potential" relies on metaphor that self-explains rather than trusts the image. Stock body language ("her mind racing," "her heart light") in key beats dulls specificity. The final paragraph's "she was ready to begin again" is scaffolding that recaps rather than advances. Figurative density in the opening (prismatic shards, swirling sea, translucent panes) is high but remains legible. Template cadence is minimal; no major clarity breaks. Apply cumulative artifact penalty (paraphrase loops, stock phrases, scaffold line) totaling approximately −0.6 to −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. No loops, template cadence, or metaphor muddle in peak beats. Sentence stems vary; paragraph structure supports momentum. Minor density slip: "the pavilion's emotionally contagious nature worked both ways" tells mechanics rather than showing them through gesture or micro-action, and the final cooking paragraph layers three figurative beats without acceleration. Clean craft, no artifacts touching closure, but not quite the zero-scaffold propulsion of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "symbol of stagnation" echoes "purpose lost," "burdens" recurs in "Both of you carry burdens," and "shared language, shared pain, shared hope" stacks near-synonyms. Template cadence appears in the opening ("Its iron gears spun, casting shadows… while the choral librarian… adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses and hummed a tune") and in list-like transitions ("In French… in Mandarin… in Yoruba"). Figurative language is dense without pressure: "restless spirits," "breath held in suspense," "wounded animal," "pendulum of reconciliation" cluster without charging the closure. The prose reads as atmospheric but sluggish, with information density low in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose carries several artifacts: paraphrase loops ("The fractures weren't flaws...they were pathways" followed by "By overwhelming the mirror's surface...creating new neural pathways"), template cadence in action beats ("He lifted...He strapped...He pressed on"), and stock metaphor strings ("liquid mercury," "shattered constellations," "liquid light"). Filter-verb stacks cluster in the feedback sequence: "A memory surfaced...The mirror wasn't just reflecting...He saw his failed project." Syntactic variety is limited; many sentences open with subject-verb in similar rhythm. The final paragraph summary ("He'd done it...by rewiring reality itself") tells rather than shows the climactic achievement, dulling closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences are mostly clear and varied, with purposeful rhythm in the opening ("clung to the hillside like a secret"). Some phrases loop conceptually: "secrets" recur without reweighting, and "threshold" / "seeds of vigilance" / "latent blaze" are restated rather than deepened. Figurative language is dense in the first third ("prism-minded," "kaleidoscope," "whispered secret," "pulsing like a heartbeat") without immediate payoff, approaching overwriting. No grammar errors; information density is moderate but not high. The closure image ("key warm against her thigh") is concrete but does not propel a final causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly specific ("tears carving paths through the dust," "wings frozen in mid-beat"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She strummed again, slower this time" immediately follows the prior strumming description; "the porcelain's tone linger" and "the sound was faint, a ghost of a hum" restate similar content. Template cadence emerges in the epilogue with repeated "They'd speak" constructions. Stock phrases like "held its breath" and "symphony of creaks and groans" lack fresh specificity. The final third's summary mode ("Days passed," "Years later") compresses key beats that warrant scene presence, dulling closure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    句rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages exhibit minor scaffold. "Alaric closed his eyes, letting the silence seep into him" is followed by "Here, the silence was denser"—a paraphrase loop. The phrase "beauty in the difficult" appears twice in quick succession (once in dialogue, once in narration), and "The covenant wasn't a document but a living thing" tells what the prior images have shown. The final paragraph's "hopeful melancholy warming his chest" mixes metaphors (warmth and melancholy). No severe artifacts touch closure, but cumulative −0.6 for loops and mixed vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. However, paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy appear: "silence was not emptiness but a language" is later restated as "silence...could be a bridge or a barrier," and the final paragraph recycles the core metaphor without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the grandmother's diary entry ("loved deeply but feared to speak...buried her pain in silence until it became a language") stacks parallel structures without adding information. These patterns cumulatively drag momentum in non-closure beats (−0.6 total).

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with strong sensory detail and varied sentence structure. However, several patterns recur: "journalized" appears five times, often in similar constructions; phrases like "the tide's thought" and "undercurrent of wisdom" are repeated without escalating meaning. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("doodled on the wrapping paper of her heart") and summarizes the arc instead of trusting the image. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she'd been rushing") occasionally dull immediacy. A paraphrase loop appears when the seed cracks: "journalized the moment" followed by "her doodles blooming into spirals" restates excitement without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; opening lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Mid-story suffers minor scaffold: "The planet's name, *Vespera*, meant 'gathering of echoes' in the old tongue. Legends said…" is an expository patch. Paraphrase loop in final third: "The planet's resilience came from its willingness to bend" is restated as "to store, to echo" and then "a symphony." Template cadence in several beats: "She [verb]. The [noun] [verb]." Filter-verb stack in cavern scene not severe but present. No figurative muddle, and information density is generally high, but the explain-everything ending lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with strong specific nouns (monoliths, vortices, sodium lights) and embodied action (boots crunching, fingers finding purchase). The opening "silence had settled like a second skin" and the framing of containers as a "puzzle box designed to outthink her" supply vivid texture. Minor scaffold appears in "The patch in her pocket buzzed louder now, its vibrations syncing with her heartbeat"—the heartbeat sync feels decorative rather than causally load-bearing. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; information density is high. A single metaphor—"dropped breadcrumbs"—reads as stock but does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished and imagistic—"frost spiraled like ghostly breath," "silence pooled like indigo ink"—yet density sags under decorative metaphor clusters in nearly every paragraph. The opening and middle beats stack modifiers ("prism-song bell ringer," "sculpted hush made flesh," "synesthetically blessed") that announce rather than advance. Paraphrase loops appear: "The cavern's silence had grown oppressive, a weight…" is restated as "The sculpted hush trembled…" two paragraphs later. Template cadence in action beats ("She pressed… and began to sing. Her voice… seeped into the ice. The sculpted hush trembled…") flattens rhythm. No major causality breaks, but overwriting and synonym churn reduce momentum, triggering −0.6 to −0.8 in Q7 and disqualifying 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    "Avalanchingly quiet" appears twice with identical phrasing; minor loop penalty. Some figurative density clusters without full payoff: "needle through silk," "tapestry of grief," "blade" for riddle, "swarm of moths"—each vivid but not all constrain action. "The canyon held its breath" is stock. Sentence openings vary and information density is adequate. No major scaffold or template cadence runs. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks. The line "To harvest insights from failure was to stop fighting the current" reads as summary-thesis rather than scene pressure, docking momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.3)
    Imagery is vivid and specific ("burnt sapphire and iron filings," "Möbius strip syntax"), and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Rhythm varies across beats. However, several artifact issues accumulate: "the mathematics of emotion weren't equations to be solved but rhythms to be felt" is a textbook epiphany assertion; "good. Confusion was a solvent for certainty" reads as scaffolding that tells the plan rather than showing it; and the phrase "raw heart" at the climax is a stock metaphor. The final paragraph summarizes the turn ("he understood") rather than letting the image carry it, dulling closure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax; opening and closing images bookend effectively (aurora painting stone / aurora fading in twilight). Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor loop: "The pendant vibrated/hummed/thrummed" cycles through near-synonyms across multiple beats without adding pressure beyond intensification. "Fleeting moments into seeds" and "germinate the past" are repeated conceptually. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Figurative language (spectral hand, smoke, tendrils) remains coherent and serves atmosphere without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is adequate; no obvious loops or scaffold. However, several figurative phrases cluster without payoff: "crystalline branches piercing...like frozen lightning," "mist swirled, responding," "repository, a living archive." Mixed metaphor: "sponge" for emotions, then "seeping into stone" creates vehicle confusion. Stock mystic diction ("commune," "channeled," "talisman") recurs without fresh grounding. The line "The quartz didn't absorb emotions—it mirrored them" is clean exposition but lacks image charge. Propulsion is steady but not tight; beats could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and key images (amber glow, puzzle dissolving to dust, loom creak) are concrete. However, pervasive figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff appears in nearly every paragraph: "sunlight dripped...like liquid gold," "silence swallowed their songs," "symbols rearranging like liquid," "silence frayed, thinning like old fabric." Mixed metaphor: silence both "ravels" (tangles) and "unravels" (comes apart) across the text without clarifying which motion dominates. Template cadence in the middle: "She sorted...She worked...She pressed...She understood" creates a drumbeat. Stock phrasing: "hitting her like a physical blow," "the weight of unspoken words." Apply −0.8 in Q7 for density and coherence issues; the final paragraph's shift to past-tense legend-telling ("travelers would speak") adds −0.3 for tense inconsistency. Total artifacts spread: −1.1.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clarity and grammar are clean. Sentences vary in length and propulsion is adequate. However, the piece carries mild scaffold: "His forge sat beneath one such arch, its shadow stretching…" is decorative setup; "His hands were calloused, his voice rarely raised, but his resolve was a quiet fire" is label-stacked interiority. The climax beat ("The first shard struck… He didn't flinch… 'Resilience isn't born…'") narrates ordeal in summary rather than concrete action, reducing information density. No loops or severe artifacts, but figurative language ("like ancient ribcages," "essence of awakened magic") leans stock in early paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the portal sequence. Information density is high in the opening paragraph, anchoring visor, bay, shard, and backstory efficiently. Minor loops: "The shard's pull" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs; "Show me" / "what happens now" dialogue feels template-adjacent. Stock metaphor: "truth was a knife that cut both ways." The phrase "weaving between worlds" and "cyclically spontaneous" in the closing paragraph read as prompt-echo insertions rather than organic thought. Proofreading is clean; no grammar breaks. Peak beats (portal fall, woman reveal) are vivid and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean with strong verbs ("sputtered," "tumbling," "slanted") and vivid particulars (pale blue sea glass, spiral stairs, iron railing rust). Rhythm varies and paragraphs breathe appropriately. Two frictions lower the score: "a faint chime, like wind chimes in a storm, though none hung in the tower" is a near-tautology (chime/chimes), and "the ache of the dark remained, but now it was luminescent" mixes metaphors (ache as quality that glows). Additionally, "their fates etched into the very stones" is stock phrasing. Template cadence does not appear, and information density is high. The final image—"its song a quiet hymn to the night"—charges effectively despite minor figurative strain.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "She'd accidentally discovered its prophetic nature years ago: adjust the wick just so, and the shadows it cast would reveal fragments of the future. Not clear images, but feelings, colors, the shape of events yet to unfold" restates the same content across three clauses without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She laughed again... She needed to see more. Grasping the lantern firmly, she stepped..."). Stock metaphors ("like a captured comet," "restless gods," "liquid night") stack without fresh specificity. Figurative density in the opening and middle third ("wind tugging at her cloak," "shadows burst free, spilling across the balcony") dilutes momentum. The closure beat is relatively clean, capping deductions at −0.8 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, but pervasive scaffold holds the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("stolen secret," "tiny, angry star"). Two minor slips: "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" recur as abstracted labels in the final paragraph without fresh embodiment (−0.3). A slight paraphrase loop appears mid-story when Lin's realization is restated across adjacent lines ("felt different. It felt purposeful.") (−0.2). Information density is high, and clarity remains intact. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No major grammar or continuity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (damp stone, rusted gears, glowing bark) and minimal filter verbs. However, several lines display figurative overwriting in non-peak beats: "lightning flashing through the windows like a celestial heartbeat," "their memories etched into the labyrinth's soul." The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops ("the sorrow would always pool" / "even in loss, there was light") and summary-style phrasing that flattens momentum. Template cadence in the opening third ("He'd been tasked," "He reached," "He knelt") triggers a −0.4 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied, with vivid imagery throughout. However, pervasive overwriting dulls momentum: nearly every paragraph stacks metaphors without breathing room ("time pooled like mercury," "parchment and iridescent as a moth's wings," "light bled into everything" all within the opening third). Paraphrase loops appear: "the songs were silent, the stories scattered" immediately followed by "to gather those ashes, to swaddle the realm." The final paragraph summarizes closure rather than dramatizing it: "The woven dawns spread, a bound release of hope, knitting the realm together." Template cadence: "She began to hum… She moved from tree to tree… She looked at her hands…" across the final section. These artifacts appear in the closure beat, triggering the upper deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is largely clean, with varied sentence structures and evocative images (warping reflection, glassy surface). However, several paraphrase loops and scaffolding phrases appear: "She'd come not to join, but to hide—to stay while leaving, to observe without being seen" restates the same idea three ways; "felt both out of place and oddly at home" is cliché. Template cadence in the opening ("She'd never opened it—not out of fear, but reverence") and stock phrases ("tears prickled her eyes," "cold in her palm") reduce density. The mirror-chamber beat—crucial for the arc—relies on summary ("Tears prickled her eyes") rather than immediate sensory detail. No artifact obscures causality, but momentum sags in reflective stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but paraphrase loops appear: "creeping normality" is defined in the opening and then re-explained via Elias's quest. Several beats restate rather than advance: the bread paragraph ends with "thread he'd spent years trying to unravel," then the next beat opens with courtyard changes—ellipsis, but the bread's import is never leveraged. "Heuristically gentle" appears twice in identical phrasing without variation. Stock metaphors cluster: "green flames," "bleed into," "seeps through." The final paragraph's "ever the creeping normality noticer" recycles the opening label. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double work (hands trembling + planting), but others loop ("The sacred wasn't hidden; it was waiting"). No major syntax runs, but rhythm feels uniform across emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clarity is high and sentences advance story without major loops. However, "gently meticulous" appears twice in identical phrasing, and "the edge of oblivion" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence in the sampling sequence: "She adjusted... She hummed... She scribbled... She sampled... She reached..." across five consecutive beats without variation. Mixed metaphor: "tomb" versus "sanctuary" works, but "quartz hush" as a sound descriptor is strained. Information density is moderate; some lines ("Tonight, it felt less like a sanctuary and more like a tomb") tell rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the market and tower sequences. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "Her mission was to thwart the sale of a recording device" immediately followed by restating what the device does; "Each misstep sharpened her resolve" after listing two missteps feels like scaffold. The phrase "comforting unease" in the final paragraph is abstract and under-dramatized. "Lira's plan was a tangle of false starts" tells rather than trusts the prior showing. Minor filter-verb reliance ("She was the moonshine runner's daughter") is voice-acceptable but clusters in exposition. Proofreading is clean; no major grammar or continuity errors. Line-level clarity is strong in action beats but suffers from expository padding in setup.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in sensory beats. However, template cadence appears in the taste-shift sequence ("first taste was lavender...then it shifted...followed by"). The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" recurs three times without evolving meaning, bordering on synonym churn. "Luminous skeptic" and "flared brighter when Old Marlow passed by" read as stock metaphor strings. No loops obscure causality, but figurative density in the opening paragraph (moths, celestial flame, restless energy) slightly overloads the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence variety and rhythm are strong; no template cadence. Information density is high in the painting ritual. However, multiple paraphrase loops and near-synonym runs appear: "suppressed creativity that had festered" / "soul starved of color," "the ghost of his younger self—the boy who had once believed," "rectified the silence, the suppression, the fear." The final paragraph's "the cave around him fading into insignificance" deflates prior spatial anchoring rather than recharging it. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in the opening and middle without voice motivation. Figurative density ("jagged teeth seemed to pulse," "crystals seemed to lean in," "auroral sorrow") occasionally blurs specificity. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and filter stacks touching escalation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports scene turns. However, several patterns reduce density: the phrase "the quill in her pocket" recurs across multiple beats without reweighting, and "the Archive" + descriptor constructions repeat (Archive's keeper, Archive is a lie, Archive not empty). Mixed metaphor in "truth...was a balm" followed immediately by "quill uncurled" stacks botanical imagery without clear vehicle logic. The keeper's exposition block ("The city's AI recycles them...") reads as tell-heavy summary rather than discovery through action. No severe loops, but template cadence in emotional beats ("Elara's breath hitched," "Elara's hands trembled," "Elara cradled") flattens voice under pressure. Information density is adequate but not exceptional; several lines do single jobs when two would tighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is polished but over-written in key beats. "The air shimmered with secrets only the wind could interpret" and "notes that rippled through the mist like liquid light" stack metaphors without causal pressure. Paraphrase loop: paragraph four's "symphony was not just sound—it was truth" is restated as "unspoken wonders, the color of moments too fragile for words." Template cadence in final paragraph: "not something to be captured, but something to be released—over and over, like…like…like" creates mechanical rhythm. Figurative density in closure beat weakens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clean, but several patterns accumulate: "she'd been ignoring," "she'd learned," "she'd built" cluster in early exposition; "felt like" appears three times (organic, threat, song), creating a mild template cadence. The phrase "strangely organic" and "fragmented wholeness" drift toward elevated diction that doesn't quite fit an android caretaker's interior lexicon. The plasma torch beat is vivid, but "with a sound like shattering glass" is a stock simile. Information density is high in the burn sequence; the reflective closing paragraph loops slightly, restating the static-as-song metaphor. No major loops or scaffolding, but minor redundancies across adjacent lines prevent entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean with varied syntax and no major loops. Information density is acceptable in scene but thins during the summary week. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she noticed," "she decided") in non-crisis moments. The phrase "her mind already racing" and "her pulse quickened" are stock embodiments. The combination-lock solution is told in exposition rather than shown through Clara's action, losing propulsion at a key beat. No artifacts touch the closure, but the summary middle and several generic descriptors ("dog-eared novel," "flour-dusted") reduce specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, metaphor saturation appears in most sentences of the opening and closing beats without pattern-teaching ("spider spins its web," "threads are spun from the same silk as a lover's whisper," "walk its threads without fear")—mixed vehicle coherence (spider/lover/fortress) triggers −0.5. Template cadence in the middle section: "He'd spent years...he'd come to...he recalled" (three parallel stems) adds −0.4. The closure beat ("The laboratory sank deeper...dancers long gone but never silent. Kael smiled.") loops thematic summary rather than propelling a final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is concrete (brittle white fragments, cool smooth surface). However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "pockets of gravity" is re-explained across paragraphs without added pressure, and "gleaming silence" bookends without evolving. The phrase "seemed to" recurs frequently, stacking filter verbs in high-pressure beats (gravity flaring, air thickening, chamber humming). The final paragraph summarizes the thematic pivot rather than propelling it through image, and the doubled "gleaming silence" in the last line reads as echo rather than payoff. Template cadence is avoided, but density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.9)
    Overwriting pervades: "terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "nocturnal haven" stack figurative and abstract phrasing in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle ("the hush was not passive; it was a force, a current" restates without adding pressure). Mixed metaphor: "tranquil blaze" contradicts itself; "hush must flow like starlight" mixes incompatible vehicles. Template cadence runs appear in the reflective blocks ("She had learned…She had spent…She had done"). Cumulative deductions: density −0.6, coherence −0.5, loop −0.4, total cap per artifact rule at 3.9 with final-third presence disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and clarity holds throughout. Minor scaffold appears in the opening ("his specialty the dialects of stone and timber—the forgotten tongues of buildings") where apposition restates rather than advances. The climactic beat ("let the words rise, not from his throat, but from his bones") is vivid but edges toward elevated register for a moment of peak stress. No loops or major artifacts touch closure; line-level control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but sometimes muddy: "resonance structures" appears repeatedly without concrete grounding, and "tragically radiant" is asserted rather than shown through embodied detail. Paraphrase loops are minimal, yet several beats recycle metaphor vehicles (light/shadow, breath/fog). The closure paragraph stacks abstract claims ("lighter," "shed a skin," "tragically radiant... meant she could shine") that dilute concrete propulsion. Clarity holds throughout; no major grammatical errors or timeline breaks. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere without advancing plot or character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure: "Her forgeries were never meant to deceive the living. They were keys with no apparent lock, designed to open doors in the aftermath of war" states the concept twice. "The key with no apparent lock was her method" repeats the metaphor without deepening it. Stock metaphors—"liquid time," "velvet" silence, "iron and regret"—cluster in the opening third, and the phrase "calibrated treason" is invoked without concrete embodiment. Minimal scaffold, but figurative density in early beats slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.1)
    Density is uneven: the opening paragraph front-loads metaphor ("stone coils like a sleeping serpent," "threads in the webs of intrigue") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "He began his ascent… He paused… He continued upward." The final paragraph loops the seashell motif cleanly. Clarity remains high and no causality is obscured, but overwriting in the first third and repetitive stems in the middle drag momentum. Propulsion recovers at the summit scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template cadence across dream vignettes ("The first dream… The second dream… The third dream…") triggers −0.5. Paraphrase loop: "windows… were fragile things" restated as "windows of connection were open" without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor "borrowed starlight" recurs without evolving meaning. Several filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("believed," "suspected," "knew," "felt"). Clarity is adequate; grammar clean. Information density uneven—dream summaries compress three lives into ornamental sketches. Baseline artifacts pull score below 6.5; no figurative muddle touching closure, so penalties remain in mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and vivid sensory detail ("their bioluminescent trails weaving through the reeds like liquid silver"). Information density is high in descriptive passages but dips during reflective interludes that paraphrase the theme. Minor loops appear: "the bamboo tea whisk" is named repeatedly with slight variation but no escalating function across mentions, and "hidden patterns" / "hidden labor" / "the hidden" cycle without fresh pressure. The final paragraph offers closure through image rather than exposition, but "demure audacity" in the penultimate paragraph risks thematic summary. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; clarity remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence structure. Opening image ("apples glowed like miniature suns") and "fingers grasping for an unseen force" are vivid. Minor loops: "The orchard's trees defied logic—thriving..." echoes prompt language; "truth excavator" and "comfortable lies" recur as labels without fresh embodiment. The phrase "The wasteland stretched ahead, but for the first time in years, Mara felt hope" tells emotional shift rather than showing it through image or action. Information density is solid; no major scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("clawed," "drowned skies," "circuit board gone feral," "wounded beast," "symphony of thunder") with several metaphors stacked in single sentences, creating overwriting in peak beats without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("variant allegiance," "lyrically prophetic") that clashes with grounded action (−0.3). Paraphrase loops appear: "ancient shadows" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure; "frequencies" and "radio" cycle through synonym variants (crackled, transmission, static) in adjacent beats (−0.4). "Across the rise of a prophet" appears twice, verbatim, as a structural marker without clear function, reading as scaffold (−0.2). Accumulation cap applied: −1.4 total in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "In glass and rust, I find my trade— / to sweeten silence" restates "to become the translator… to sweeten the world's sharp edges." The three verse attempts with parenthetical commentary create a template cadence and scaffold the reader through revision rather than dramatizing it. "Lonesome splendor," "positively wistful," and "gleaned redemption" feel like prompt labels rather than earned images. Stock metaphors ("bridge between worlds," "thief of echoes") accumulate without fresh specificity. These patterns cluster in the middle third, warranting −0.8 to −1.0 total deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear with good sensory anchoring and varied sentence rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The key's power wasn't just about locking doors—it was about harmonizing frequencies, uniting the physical and the spectral" restates the bridge concept already shown. Template cadence runs in the opening ("his boots crunching," "his hands… adjusted," "his breath fogged"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh texture: "horizon bled tangerine," "edges flickering like a broken film reel," "voice crackled, a sound like grinding ice." These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic stems or loops. Information density is high in the alignment beats (filings coiling, moon beam through fissure, nodes etched in stone). Minor scaffold appears: "The revolution wasn't in grand gestures, but in the quiet persistence" and "The revolution wasn't over; it had just begun" recycle the same prompt-adjacent phrasing without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled (filings "debating their purpose," ice as "glassy sheet"), though "dance: the moon's cold grace against the viaduct's restless hum" leans purple without sensory grounding. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. The coda's summary mode ("In the weeks that followed…") compresses transit efficiently but dilutes closure momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear with moderate momentum, but several artifact patterns accumulate. Template cadence runs: "She'd been told... but Mara knew better," "She'd always been... but now she felt," "She'd use... not to entangle... but to sever." Paraphrase loop: "The lantern's memories weren't a gift—they were a chain" immediately follows "she'd been a pawn in someone else's game." Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity: "smooth as oil," "writhe like living things," "fierce, unyielding thing." Filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("she felt," "she saw," "she knew") dull immediacy. Figurative density in the final third (tunnel shrinks, walls press, flame blazes) reads effortful without clear payoff. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7 for template cadence, paraphrase loop, and stock metaphor concentration across the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean and clear. Rhythm varies and sensory detail is specific. However, several scaffold sentences and minor loops appear: "He thought of the inmates he'd met—men who had made mistakes, some terrible, but who now sought redemption" restates the program's premise without new pressure. "The warden's program wasn't just about repairing music boxes; it was about repairing lives" is a mechanical summary of the already-shown theme. Template cadence in the opening (weathered case, narrow aisle, pressed sky) and synonym churn around "deliberate" (twice) slightly dull momentum. No artifacts touch closure directly, so cap is −0.8 total.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the kaleidoscope sequence; sensory detail (acid mist, clacking gears, prismatic sky) propels rather than stalls. Template-cadence issue: multiple beats open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]" stems in rapid succession, creating mechanical rhythm in the middle third. Figurative language ("metronome to her restlessness," "collision of gears and light") reads vivid but occasionally stacks without deepening the image. No major loops or scaffolding detected; clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and no major grammatical errors. However, the text exhibits paraphrase loops: "numbers kept leading her back" / "the numbers led and the truth waited"; "her eyes brightly attentive" / "brightly attentive gaze." Stock metaphors appear in pressure beats ("sea of data streams," "footprints in snow," "beacon for those brave enough"). The final sequence relies on telling over showing: "her mind racing toward the edge of the system" asserts rather than dramatizes her escape. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance plot but few do multiple jobs simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful sensory detail (frost-heavy branches, fogged mirrors, groaning ice). Minor overwriting appears in figurative clusters: "shadow-laced," "midnight ice flickered with quiet fire," "silence felt like a language," "gave it a heart" within a compressed span. Template cadence emerges in the mirror-walk sequence ("In the first mirror… In the second… In the third…") without dramatic pressure escalation across those beats. The final paragraph's "She hadn't stopped the storm, but she'd given it a heart" leans on metaphor where a concrete image would sharpen the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. The keening-sound sequence and rescue choreography are clear and propulsive. However, repetitive stems appear: "She'd arrived," "She'd come," "She didn't know why she'd brought it," "She'd done nothing," "She closed her eyes"—a template cadence of past-perfect subject-verb openers that flattens momentum across paragraphs. The phrase "fold in patience" is repeated verbatim twice without deepening on the page, reading as thematic placeholder. "Grips reality loosely" in the opening is vivid but never operationalized in action. No loops or mixed metaphors touch the closure beat, limiting penalty scope.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clear, rhythmic, and imagistic with strong opening and closing lines. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Sentence variety supports the contemplative tone without becoming sluggish. Minor points: "his steps lighter than before" tells rather than showing the shift, and "the space where meaning lives" edges toward abstract elevation in a peak beat. Overall, line-level craft is polished with no artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "murmuring pavilion" / "pavilion's whispers" / "pavilion trembled" / "pavilion fell silent" / "pavilion began to hum" across seven beats without new information. Template cadence: "The prophet [verb]. Mara [verb]. The parapet [verb]." Figurative language is heavy but vague ("voices coiling like smoke," "branches on a tree") without coherent vehicle. Stock high-fantasy diction ("beading on his brow," "wind chimes," "beacon in the endless sea") replaces specificity. Apply −1.2 for loops and template stems; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports emotional beats. Figurative language density is high throughout—"green fingers feeling for the sky," "secrets waiting to be deciphered," "streaks of gold and violet"—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to escalation. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt like") and stock metaphors (doves as messengers) cluster in reflective passages. Paraphrase loops appear: "the factory's decay as a kind of collaboration" is restated as "nature and time working together." Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the crystal-reflection beats. However, several scaffold phrases recur without added pressure: "suspended hush" appears three times, "fractured sequences" four times, creating mild synonym churn. The opening and closing paragraphs feature template cadence with "He had," "He would," "He saw" stems. Purple-adjacent phrasing—"the chaos of conversation," "tapestry of fractured sequences"—clusters in mid-passage without sharp payoff. Proofreading is clean and choreography clear, but the loops and stock metaphors prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally strong, but several artifacts lower the score. "The fog clung... like a second skin" and "dissolved like sugar in tea" are stock metaphors. Paraphrase loop: "He'd heard it once, a low, resonant hum like a shell pressed to the ear, but it had slipped away before he could pin it down" is restated in the climax ("There it was—the sound of growing older... a low, steady vibration") without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "When the sound faded, Elias opened his eyes and smiled. He took the chalk and drew... Then he turned and walked..." runs three consecutive "He [verb]" stems. The phrase "amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched" recurs as a bookend but reads as imposed atmosphere rather than organic rhythm. Apply −0.8 for stock metaphors, paraphrase loop, and template cadence; these artifacts touch the closure paragraph, preventing 9+ entry and capping high-band at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Figurative language is dense but mostly clear ("clouds churned like boiling milk"). However, several lines loop or restate without added pressure: "The hand's spin had accelerated to a blur, its whine a deafening roar" immediately follows escalating descriptions of the same phenomenon. The phrase "changelessly constant" appears twice without reweighting. Stock phrasing ("heart raced," "breath came in shallow gasps") clusters in the climax, dulling immediacy. No artifacts touch the final leap, so damage is contained.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and moves forward, but suffers from paraphrase loops ("Her motivation burned fierce: to execute a flawless goodbye, to bridge the chasm" restates the stake unnecessarily) and stock metaphor strings ("the scent of hope," "alchemy of melody," "vessels of meaning"). Template cadence appears in reflective beats: "She'd seen this dance...," "She thought of her mother...," "She touched her own pocket..." forming repetitive stems. Mixed metaphors and register drift touch peak beats ("pulsing stillness that made time seem to both quicken and slow"). Figurative density in high-pressure moments ("bleeding orange into the clouds," "thread that stitched their fractured goodbyes") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase/template patterns and stock metaphor strings; artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the pulsing stillness of it all"), disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high; most lines advance setting, character goal, or atmosphere. The opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly. However, paragraph three contains a paraphrase loop: "The observatory's location was no accident" immediately followed by restating why the location matters. Minor scaffold appears in "Her motivation was simple yet profound" (telling what should emerge through action). The final beat is clear and propulsive. No mixed metaphors or register drift mar the prose. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high in the first two paragraphs; the garden's history, Mara's tools, and the drowned-wanderer detail compress efficiently. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs are evident. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She'd yearned," "she believed," "she'd read") cluster in exposition but do not obscure immediacy in peak beats. The phrase "the quiet certainty of a puzzle solved" after "not with a bang" is near-cliché but contextually apt. Overall, line-level craft is clean and propulsive, with no artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies and information density is generally high, but several beats loop conceptually: "Memories resurfaced" appears twice with similar phrasing, and the grotto's glow/vibrance is restated without added pressure. Template cadence in places ("She placed… She began… She held…") and near-synonym churn ("task… art… method") dull momentum. Metaphors are mostly coherent, though "earthbound star watcher" and "pearl of stillness" trend abstract. Line-level clarity is good, but scaffold sentences and paraphrase loops prevent entry into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high (server racks as anchors, drip pattern mapped to sun angle, obsidian shard inside pendant). Clarity is strong across spatial choreography and action sequence. Two friction points lower the score: "honeyed hush" appears three times with slight synonym churn ("deepened," "settled," "container") without clear escalation, and the closing paragraph includes minor template cadence ("All those wounds, now threaded…"). The figurative language (drips as heartbeat, grafting as conversation) remains coherent but borders on density in peak beats without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and most lines advance atmosphere or plot. However, several phrases loop: "the mist curled," "the woman," "the seashell fragment," "the nexus" recur as stems without functional variation, triggering a −0.4 paraphrase penalty. "Swirling hush" appears twice in identical phrasing. The metaphor "time and truth tangled like kelp in a storm" is vivid, but "hope was a current—wild, untamable, always moving" stacks near-synonyms without added precision. No major clarity breaks, but density could tighten in the middle third where Clara's passive observation stretches across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with vivid figurative language ("sunlight slanted through leaves like liquid gold," "a sound like wind through wheat"), but several phrases loop conceptually: "when everything aligns" appears three times as thematic anchor rather than propulsion. The final third stacks summary statements ("The arbor's magic wasn't in objects or songs alone," "the true remedy lay in the hands of those who dared to remember") that paraphrase rather than advance pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-story transitions ("As the final note faded," "When the moon climbed higher"), and the closure paragraph recycles "stories spinning" without fresh charge. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and summary drag in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line-level clarity is strong, and sentence rhythm varies appropriately. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He had done it. He had sealed the safekept starlight, and in doing so, he had found a way…" restates the same triumph without adding pressure. Stock metaphors recur without fresh embodiment ("breath hung in the air," "lanterns," "warm current"). Filter verbs cluster in the climax beat ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to echo"), dulling immediacy where the moment should sharpen, triggering a −0.5 artifact deduction in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high; the opening paragraph establishes cavern, character, and object efficiently. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "He'd done it. Not by force, but by listening…" restates the peripherally-focused method already shown. Template cadence appears in sequences like "He worked methodically… The mirror was key… These etchings, he realized…" Stock phrasing—"a puzzle for a man," "a testament to the idea"—and the final clause "And in doing so, he'd learned…" flatten momentum slightly in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and many lines carry dual purpose (e.g., "The burner's brass had patinaed to a sickly green, but its wick still held a flicker" grounds setting and stakes simultaneously). However, figurative density spikes without pattern-teaching: "jagged shadows," "tongue" of flame, "whalebone reverie," "scale-covered hide," and "restless spirits" cluster in adjacent beats, creating mild overwriting. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "He lit the burner… He held the lamp close… He closed his eyes… He reoriented the lamp…" across consecutive paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: "Kael's people believed burdens…solidified into stone" is immediately restated as "These were the unclaimed burdens…dissolved into the grotto's shingled hush." Deductions: −0.6 for density/template issues, not touching closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and sensory density are strong; no grammar errors. However, pervasive figurative language creates density without always advancing pressure: "silver threads," "watercolor haze," "ghostly echo," "monument to here and gone" cluster in many sentences. Paraphrase loop: "The loft existed outside time, a bubble where the past and present coexisted" restates the prior "time as mosaic" concept. Template cadence: "She lit... She sharpened... She rose... She sipped... She worked..." runs across multiple beats. Minor scaffold: "the kind that comes only after the storm has passed" tells what has been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is concrete (bruised violet, grinding gears, coiled regret), but several beats suffer from synonym churn and template cadence: "She'd memorized... the way the water sloshed... the way it hissed" repeats structure without adding pressure. Metaphor density is high ("ghost that materialized," "echo of her younger self," "stuck coin," "mirrored surface") and occasionally mixed (ghost as hologram, then echo, then mirror). The closure beat is clean, but paraphrase loops in the ghost dialogue ("You've brought me trinkets" / "You cling to fragments") and expository interiority ("Regret coiled... hot and familiar") lower the band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and no paraphrase loops appear, but the prose carries moderate scaffold: "Her goal wasn't just to find it; she wanted to puzzle out new equations for hope" restates the same intent without added pressure. The climactic beat—"She knelt, placing the sextant piece at the center of the atrium's crater. Using her engineering tools, she began recalibrating the terminal's hidden conduits, rerouting electrical and water systems into a makeshift generator"—summarizes the pivotal action in two generic verbs ("placing," "recalibrating") without tactile specificity. Stock phrasing appears in emotional beats ("her breath caught," "stoic wonder filling her chest"). Information density is adequate but not high; many sentences perform one job only.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice. Information density is good in the bear sequence. Two frictions lower the score: "She had come to make peace with her abandoned dream, but perhaps the dream had never been abandoned—only paused" is a paraphrase loop that restates interior content across two clauses without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the final workshop paragraph ("She picked up… began to repair… The work was… But now, when she paused…") shows repetitive stem structure across three moves (−0.4). These artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short urgent beats at the warehouse, longer reflective passages on the barge) and information density is moderate. However, adjacent sentences loop conceptually: "It wasn't just a map to a place; it was a key to understanding" / "The sundial wasn't just a tool for telling time; it was a compass for truth" recycles the "wasn't just X; it was Y" template without added pressure. "Architecture of lies" appears three times, twice in close proximity, without evolving charge. Figurative language is vivid ("liquid silver," "eyes like drowned coins") but occasionally stacked ("slow fuse," "labyrinth of lies," "fog of misdirection") in descriptive passages. Clarity holds; no causality breaks. One paraphrase loop and template cadence trigger −0.4 to −0.6 deduction within Q7's non-closure band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory anchors are vivid (snow-brushed glass, salt-stiffened rope). However, paraphrase loops appear: "You've waited centuries for this" echoes the earlier "decades of salt and sun" sentiment, and "the act of preservation itself—the refusal to let ancient wisdom die" restates the same idea within two lines. Template cadence emerges in the second paragraph's repetitive "had claimed… had left… had rasped… had studied" sequence. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative scaffold reduces density.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is adequate and grammar clean. However, multiple artifacts lower momentum: paraphrase loops in the final section ("one obituary, one thread, one explained absence" / "her purpose, her peace, her place"), repetitive sentence stems ("She wrote," "She stood," "She paused," "She turned"), and template cadence in the penultimate paragraph where four consecutive sentences begin with declarative constructions. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity ("heart a map," "words a bridge," "beacon in the dark"). The figurative density in the vision sequence (lines 4–5) risks overwriting but remains legible. Scaffold phrasing and synonym churn reduce information density in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and syntax is generally clear, but the piece carries several template patterns: repeated "his [noun] [verb]" constructions ("his boots clicking," "his hands trembled," "his voice echoing") and stock metaphors ("like a dying star," "like a frozen tear"). Figurative density is high in the opening without payoff: "suspended palace," "crystal spires," "stolen starlight," "fractured grandeur" accumulate within two sentences. Paraphrase loops appear: "beauty was not engineered but *grown*" / "life could not be forged but must be *nurtured*." The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes ("It was flawed...it was *alive*"), reducing propulsion at closure. Information density is moderate; scaffolding phrases ("he'd written," "he said") could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Some overwriting: "edges frayed by years of smothering guilt" stacks metaphors, "jingle like a warning" is generic, "a sound like wind chimes" is stock. Paraphrase loop: "She'd inherited her father's restlessness but channeled it into firefighting" then "to outrun the flames he'd once fed" restates the same causal link. Final paragraph tells theme rather than advancing image. Clarity is high; momentum sags in the reflective close. No loops severe enough to obscure closure but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but sometimes strained ("pause of migrating geese—when the world held its breath mid-flight" is abstract; "defiant hush" recurs as a label). Template cadence appears in the breadcrumb-collection beats: "The first breadcrumb was... The next clue... The third breadcrumb led..." creating a checklist structure (−0.5). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn, but information density is low in the middle—each breadcrumb beat repeats the find-place-hum pattern without complication. Opening and closing lines are vivid, but several sentences prioritize ornament over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is often striking ("petals drifted like forgotten constellations"). However, several template-cadence runs appear ("Lumin understood. The Enclave's ban hadn't been about... it had been about..."), and synonym loops recur around "light" and "fire" without adding pressure. The phrase "approximates infinity" appears twice in similar constructions, feeling like prompt-checklist fulfillment. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks dense enough to trigger heavy penalties, but cumulative minor issues lower clarity and propulsion in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors (brittle leaves crunching, lantern flicker, ribbon colors shifting). The opening establishes voice and stakes efficiently, and figurative language (butterflies as "living embers," glass-domed ceiling) enhances without overwhelming. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "he'd come here... to retrace... to discover" stacks infinitive phrases, and "his great-grandfather, who'd... his aunt, who'd... his mother, who'd..." creates mechanical parallelism in the ancestral catalogue. Paraphrase loops occur in the spectral mentorship explanation ("echo of those who came before" / "linger here, woven into the vines"), and the ending relies on a stock opener ("On the final night") followed by future-tense summary that dulls immediacy. These artifacts cluster in non-closure beats but still impose −0.8 for template cadence and loops.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery ("blackened spine," "scales"). However, several artifacts lower the score: "ethically diligent mind" is abstract register drift; "her throat tightened" is a stock gesture; "the bob itself were remembering" uses passive construction where active would sharpen. The final paragraph's "her heart light" and "tiny, persistent acts" edge into summary where a concrete image would serve better. Density is solid but not exceptional; some lines do only one job.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.7)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "the silo's velveteen gloom deepened, the cobalt walls seeming to pulse with the rhythm of her discoveries" stacks metaphor without advancing causality. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 2 repeats "discovered/found" across adjacent sentences. Template cadence: "She traced… She understood… She rolled… She smiled… She would rebury…" in the final third. Stock metaphor: "skeletal finger," "voices trapped in the weave." Figurative density in most sentences of key beats without pattern payoff triggers −0.5; template stems and loops add −0.4; touching closure with summary adds −0.3, total deduction ~−1.2 from a functional baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentence variety and rhythm are generally controlled, with some vivid images (kingfisher diving, spiderwebbing ice). However, multiple beats recycle abstract phrasing: "groundedly imaginative," "seed innovation within constraint," "celestial ledger." The "weeks passed" summary compresses the climactic labor without propulsion, and the final paragraph's declarative tone ("Its job was done," "She smiled") flattens the closure beat. Minor template cadence appears in the list-like exposition of Lira's methods. Information density is moderate but paragraphs sometimes restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("mist curled like smoke from forgotten hearths," "the glow of the radio dial and the moss seemed to merge"), but a handful of artifacts dull momentum. "The cloak slipped from her shoulders, but she didn't notice" followed two paragraphs later by "She draped it over her shoulders" creates a minor continuity hiccup. Paraphrase loops appear: "This was why she did it" restates the motivation already dramatized. Template cadence in action beats ("She leaned closer," "She scribbled," "She adjusted," "She smiled," "She stood," "She stepped") stacks without variation. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Information density is solid, though some lines (the full description of the alcove's luminous moss) could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("shadows pool and fade," "ash glittering like stardust") serves atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the mirage-of-safety concept is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure, and template cadence recurs in the opening and closing ("The gallery exhales" appears twice with near-identical phrasing). Minor synonym churn ("deliberate, almost ritualistic" / "slow, deliberate") and abstraction ("the ache of longing, the sting of betrayal") reduce density. The final-third loops touching the closure beat trigger a −0.6 deduction in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong concrete nouns ("rusted canteen," "frayed rope," "crowbar"). However, several metaphors strain credibility ("putrid perfume," "knife for a tongue," "a razor wrapped in silk") and the piece carries minor loops: "ancient methods" recurs three times, and "competing narratives" is stated twice in similar phrasing without added pressure. The final paragraph's "he finally felt… understood" is a summary that deflates momentum rather than landing the closure through image. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paragraph two opens with template phrasing ("She had come here not to read, but to *denote*") and stacks abstract constructions ("boundaries between what was lost and what might yet be saved"). The phrase "traveled stillness" appears twice, once as italicized and once plain, creating a synonym loop without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph five ("thought," "knew," "asked"). Rhythm varies but density is uneven; several lines restate theme rather than advance scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "She'd spent those years scavenging the ruins, salvaging tools and soil" recycles "scavenging/salvaging" without added detail. Template cadence runs: "A new wave of memories: a poet's reverie...a lover's whisper...a painter's brushstrokes." The closing paragraph stacks summary: "a little pruning, a little patience, and a willingness to rebel" is scaffold moralizing. "Synaptic plasticity" and "neural pathways" intrude as jargon. Filter verbs ("she could feel," "she saw") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language ("sculpture of light and life") overwrites without concrete grounding. Apply cumulative artifact penalties: −0.6 baseline for loops and template cadence, escalated to −0.9 because they touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and purposeful detail. Opening and closing images bracket the piece effectively. However, several artifacts appear: "wondered why" then "her candor felt like" are weak stems; "the idea that something as chaotic as lightning could be tamed, harnessed, *understood*" is a list that stalls momentum; "Let them see the magic in the mundane" is a stock phrase. The riddle explanation loop (Voss explains, then Clara restates to the child) adds conceptual redundancy. Information density is moderate but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries several patterned artifacts: "She'd [verb]" template openings cluster in the second paragraph, "not haunted, not merely old, but *vibrant*" uses italic emphasis as a crutch, and the phrase "inadvertently profound" is introduced as if coined by the character yet feels like prompt-speak. The final third contains paraphrase loops ("The bay held its breath" / "a hush fell"). Stock metaphors ("walls themselves breathed," "streetlights daydreamed") appear without fresh transformation. Sentence rhythm is often sluggish, with multiple filter verbs ("she'd recognized," "she wondered," "she felt") dulling immediacy. Information density is low; many lines restate setup without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies across beats; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Two minor loops: "its telepathic voice echoed" and later "Lumen's thoughts shifted, urgent now" restate similar content (−0.2). Template cadence appears in the three-revelation sequence ("The first revelation... The second... The third") but reads purposeful rather than artifact (no penalty). Stock phrase "hit Mara like a wave" in an underwater story is a cliché but functional. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but figurative density is high without consistent payoff: "stone that shimmered like aged parchment," "a wound that heals by bleeding forever," "like a deck of cards." The rupture beat is vivid and propulsive. Template cadence appears in the backstory ("he'd come…he'd calculated…he'd memorized…he'd tested"), and "the texture of" recurs as a conceptual placeholder. Proofread clean; no major loops, but overwriting slightly dulls the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the greenhouse description and brush handling. Minor scaffold appears: "She'd become methodically hopeful" tells rather than shows the trait in action. "The smog seemed less dense" at the end is a soft atmospheric claim without causal trigger. Paraphrase near "kindness was a language too" and "Kindness outlives the tongue that speaks it" restates the same idea within close proximity (−0.2). No major loops or template cadence. Figurative language (moon slicing, ferns dripping) is vivid but dense; "saffron quiet" verges on mixed metaphor yet remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.4)
    Moderate line-level craft with several artifacts touching high-pressure beats. "Rosewater dread" appears three times without evolving meaning; template cadence runs in "She'd host a festival, revive the opera, bake bread" and "teach us… first, we bake… shape it… then we'll sing." Paraphrase loop: "The arts weren't dead; they'd just been frozen. And thawing them would take more than heat" restates the thaw metaphor without added pressure. Filter-verb stack in "she felt a fragile optimism" and "thought of Celeste" dulls immediacy. Stock metaphor "footprints in snow" and "life raft" reduce specificity. Apply −0.8 for patterned artifacts and loops touching closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats. The yoyo disassembly and mercury-coil construction are propulsive and clear. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "the hunger stone pulsed faintly, a latent radiance trapped beneath its surface" repeats "hunger stone's radiance" three times in close succession. The phrase "neatly inventive" appears twice as authorial shorthand. "Bleak exhilaration" is asserted rather than embodied. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("Elias smiled, neatly inventive to the end") breaks momentum and clarity. Minor filter-verb stacks ("seemed to shudder," "felt colder") slightly dull immediacy but don't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "bruise-colored sky," "eyes like fractured glass," "diseased star," "sickly green," "grinding gears and shattered glass." In the climax beat multiple metaphors stack without clear vehicles, reducing clarity ("mosaic of teeth and eyes…shifting like smoke" then "thousand moths" then "glowing thread"). Template cadence appears in exposition: "Mara had been photographically cursed…The curse had left her…After her resuscitation…Now, driven by…" recycles structure across four sentences. Paraphrase loop: "The shadow recoiled, its luminance dimming. …The shadow wailed, its form dissolving." Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (clasp bite = pain + commitment) but scaffolding intrudes ("she said, the words tasting of copper" after dialogue already conveys strain). No major loops touch closure, capping penalty at −0.8 under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is vivid and imagistic ("sun bled into the sea," "air thrummed like a hive"), with strong nouns and verbs. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. However, the piece exhibits minor scaffold patterns: repeated sentence stems ("She struck the mallet," "The clouds above"), and some figurative density without clear payoff (e.g., "fractal generating" and "sketched resonance" are invoked repeatedly but their mechanics remain abstract). The "dubbing" metaphor is striking but not fully integrated into causal action. No paraphrase loops or clarity breaks, but the lyric texture occasionally slows momentum in peak beats rather than propelling forward.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. Clarity is strong throughout the tunnel sequence and climax. However, two patterned artifacts lower the score: (1) "she'd" contractions appear in four consecutive lines in paragraph four, creating a template cadence; (2) the phrase "quietly driven" in paragraph three is a stock descriptor that could be cut without loss. The loop "The shells remember" → "shells are alive" → "shells did" across paragraphs 3, 8, and 9 treads close to synonym churn, though each instance adds new pressure. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear and maintains momentum through the investigation sequence. Sensory detail (damp earth, old wood, gold leaf) is selective and purposeful. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "noble lie" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "manifesto" and "truth" cycle through similar phrasings. Template cadence is mild but present: "She'd traced… She pulled… She stepped…" The final paragraph stacks epiphany summary ("Elara would write… not as a tale… but as a cautionary parallel") where image could carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and the prose advances without scaffolding. The opening anchors cleanly, and spatial choreography tracks across the pavilion's levels. However, two friction points lower the score: "stoically sensitive" is a strained oxymoron that announces rather than embodies the trait, and "hushed blaze of the setting sun" mixes incompatible metaphors (hushed implies sound; blaze implies roar). The figurative density in the first two paragraphs—"iron teeth clenching," "vines choking a ruin," "liquid amber"—borders on overwriting without pattern-teaching. No loops or template cadence, but the metaphorical muddle at key descriptive beats dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (vault sequence, journal entries). Clarity is strong; spatial choreography tracks. However, ornamental phrases recur: "dappled resolve" (visual then thematic), "tranquilly perceptive" (twice), and elevated metaphor ("resolve" as light pattern) that blurs rather than sharpens the image. The stamp's function is clear, but "a silent plea to trace honest origins" over-explains interiority. Minimal loops; no major scaffold. One paraphrase slip (blackout crept/swallowed in opening lines) does not obscure causality. Overall propulsion is solid but figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "facets catching twilight like a thousand captured stars," "conversations soft as moth wings," "sound brittle as winter ice." While imagery is vivid, the relentless metaphoric texture in nearly every sentence—even during the shadow confrontation—creates a static lyricism that flattens urgency. Paraphrase appears: "to fold grief into something that could fly" repeats the transform-through-carrying idea stated two paragraphs prior. Rhythm is controlled but uniform; sentence openings vary, yet the syntactic register never modulates with pressure. No scaffold loops or generation artifacts, but information density suffers under ornamental layering.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mixed, but several artifact patterns appear. "Intangibly tangible" and "perturbation theory" recur as unexplained tokens, treated as mystical rather than concrete. The line "It was the tremor in her hands, the way her breath hitched…" uses an "It was" scaffold, and "The hunt had changed her. She was no longer a survivor. She was a seer. A disrupter" runs three template-stem sentences in sequence. Mixed metaphor: "grief made solid" clashes with "sensation like static electricity." These issues cluster in high-pressure beats (vortex, ending), triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is otherwise high, and no paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Syntax varies; no template runs. Figurative language is controlled except for "fractal patterns," "fractal shadows" (repeated vehicle), and "brilliant dimness," which reads as placeholder lyricism. Paraphrase loops: "The pilgrim's surprise mirrored her own—a flicker of recognition in their widened eyes" restates concept without added detail. Filter verbs cluster in the opening ("She'd tracked," "She'd been hired," "She'd never seen") but do not stack densely in peak beats. Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion. Information density is moderate—some lines do double duty (lever mechanics + emotional hesitation), but the final paragraph summarizes rather than advances. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with strong images (cobalt terrace fading to gray, split heart labeled Father and Son). However, several lines loop or inflate: "the weight of unspoken words pressed harder than usual" and later "her unspoken words a noose around his neck" restate the same core image. "The sieved hush wasn't just absence. It was the space left behind when a truth was swallowed by the tide" is a paraphrase loop within two sentences. Metaphor density in the opening and closing paragraphs risks overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, figurative language is controlled, and information density is high. Two tightening issues: "Between apology and forgiveness" is repeated verbatim in two different contexts (once as framing, once as interiority), creating a paraphrase loop. The phrase "storm-worn windblown parapet" front-loads three modifiers where two would sharpen the image. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, and the final line ("the furrowed hush of the night wrapping around her like a cloak") charges the closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is often vivid ("waves slapping the hull like a metronome," "clouds in tangerine and violet"). However, multiple linesLoop or restate without advancing pressure: "Maybe he was right" echoes the ex's accusation without new insight; "The compass, she realized, wasn't for finding direction. It was for measuring regret" is followed immediately by a paraphrase expansion of the same idea. Template cadence appears in the lighthouse sequence: "She opened the compass… She sat cross-legged… She placed the compass…" stack three similar stems. Stock metaphors cluster: "salt air," "liquid mercury," "mosaic of blue" lean generic. The phrase "merrily melancholic" recurs identically, and "flickering faith" is used as a motif without varied texture. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs that dull mid-scene momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images ("water reaching her knees, its glow seeping into her skin") and efficient sequencing. A few loops appear: "She didn't know what lay ahead, but for once, she didn't need to. The journey was enough" restates the same thought twice without adding pressure. The phrase "delicately robust woman" is ornamental—its meaning unclear and its effect decorative rather than functional. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She realized") and stock metaphor ("ink in water") are present but do not obscure causality. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory specifics (moonthorn scent, cardamom paste, phoenix ashes pulsing like dormant hearts) create texture. However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "to conjure a bridge between the living and the dead, to reforge a bond beyond death" restates the same idea, and "both human and beast, both alive and dead, both here and everywhere" stacks abstract binaries without advancing sense. The phrase "cosmic intimacy" appears twice, once as tone descriptor and once as experience, diluting specificity. The fortune's echo in the final paragraph ("metamorphosis is not an ending, but a rebirth") reads as thematic summary rather than image-driven closure. Stock metaphors ("suspended breath," "like a noose") and filter-verb reliance ("she had not chosen," "she knew," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy. Clarity remains high; no major grammar or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but controlled: "robes pooling like ink," "roots coiled like hourglasses," "shift billowing like a parachute." However, multiple beats lean toward overwriting—nearly every sentence in the middle third carries metaphor or simile without pattern-teaching or payoff, approaching the density penalty threshold. Template cadence appears in "She knelt… and laid out," "She traced… She'd found… She'd read," a run of identical "She [verb]" stems that flatten propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "The glade shuddered" (twice) and "unfasten" (three times) without additive detail. Clarity remains high and no artifact obscures the closure image, so penalties are moderate. Information density is uneven—some lines do double work (saucer as relic and ritual object), others are ornamental ("lilacs—her mother's favorite flower" adds color but not pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in exposition (ship, locket, shadow work). Scaffold check: "It was said to hold the power" and "She had always believed" are mild telling but efficient. "Quantum-engineered DNA" and "collapsed star" risk genre-placeholder vagueness but remain legible. Paraphrase loop: "stitch the fraying edges of reality" / "stitch the裂缝 (fissures)" repeats the concept without added pressure. Template cadence: "She closed her eyes...She saw...She was gravitationally lighter...She did not flinch" runs a pronoun-verb stack across the climax, flattening propulsion (−0.4). The final paragraph mixes "steadfast pacifist...had become the key" summary with "corridors echoed...ghostly resolve"—echo loops the opening phrase. Minor: "via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs" appears once as parenthetical aside, not woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is coherent (volcano's breath, bugs as captured supernova). Several paraphrase loops appear: "The hush swelled" echoes "hush intensify" and "hush deepened" across adjacent beats without adding pressure. Template cadence: "She'd orchestrated… She'd assumed… She'd grasped" structures repeat. The "texture of transformation" recurs as abstract label rather than concretized image. Information density is moderate; some beats advance atmosphere more than plot. No major clarity breaks, but cumulative scaffold lowers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clear and grammatically sound, but repetitive stems and stock phrasing accumulate: "Kieran's breath caught," "Elara's eyes gleamed/bright," "heart racing," "jaw tightened." The phrase "cradle of sparks" appears five times, often in expository summary rather than scene pressure. Opening and closing sentences are competent but lack propulsive charge. Information density is moderate; several beats paraphrase prior material (blackout as test, sundial as cipher) without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several beats carry elevated diction that clashes with the POV's urgency ("a dance of probability and intention," "bruise-purple," "living sigil"), trending toward lyric ornament in peak moments. One paraphrase loop appears: "The promise wasn't to control… but to witness" restates the prior "not to control… but to witness" without added pressure. A mild template cadence runs through the vision-flare beats ("The star dust flared. A vision struck… The vision fractured… The star dust surged"). These artifacts dull immediacy but do not obscure causality at closure; applying −0.6 in Q7 for the combined loop and template patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (e.g., darkroom timer marks breath and time). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The Ministry's enforcers wore smooth porcelain masks, their faces hidden behind curated smiles" then "Kael's own mask was a patchwork...It didn't hide his scars" restates contrast across adjacent beats. Template cadence in the storm-peak paragraph ("When masks slip...When scars speak...To rarefy is to hold") creates a three-stem run. Stock metaphor "liquid mercury" and "divine signature" are present. Apply −0.8 cumulative (paraphrase loop −0.3, template run −0.4, stock metaphor −0.1). No closure-beat contamination but spread is noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is crisp with strong imagery (prismatic shadows, constellation of dots, gears whirring) and varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high; each paragraph advances duel or discovery. Two minor artifact patterns emerge: near-paraphrase loops ("not decoded / recontextualized," "not destinations / directions") and one template-stem run in the opening (multiple "his/her" openers). No severe scaffold or opacity, but the final paragraph edges toward summary ("something had shifted") where a concrete image would sharpen. Line-level clarity and propulsion are solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "The tin was his talisman, a relic" restates function without added detail; "Each month, when his personality molted, he'd return to the tin" is echoed two paragraphs later in "He'd spent his life running from his molting selves." Template cadence appears in sequential "He'd found... He'd hidden... He'd scrawled" stems. Mixed metaphor in "his mind fracturing and reforming" then "felt the shift like a earthquake" (tectonic vs. mental architecture) blurs the vehicle. "Luminous fracture" in the climactic writing beat reads as stock poetic diction rather than Cedar-specific invention, and the closing "For now, it was enough" doubles the sentiment within two lines, flattening propulsion at closure. Baseline −0.8 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and some images land sharply ("glass ribs shimmering," "keys that stuck like half-forgotten memories"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "the trance felt less like solace and more like a cage" immediately follows "to let the arbor's constant, rhythmic sway... lull her into a trance," restating the emotional shift without added pressure. The phrase "fate's way of laughing at her, of reminding her" is synonym churn. Stock metaphors ("sugar in rain," "old lace") and elevated diction in peak beats ("dervishes," "pulsing beneath the piano's keys like a heartbeat") drift from the established POV lexicon. Template cadence in the opening block ("She'd come... She'd meant... She'd set them down") adds mild scaffold. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty, but the film-reel sequence could be tightened. No loops touch the closure beat, capping total artifact deduction at −0.8 under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("air hummed with forgotten hymns," "colors deepened," "glass rained down...melted into liquid light") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "The collective memory was not a single thread but a web" restates the fraying-tapestry image from two paragraphs prior. Template cadence runs in the cavern ("A child's laughter echoed...A fisherman's net...frayed") flatten propulsion. The final beat's "smile, her doubt transformed into resolve" summarizes rather than dramatizes the shift, and the seed's vanishing act is told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies (the opening's measured cadence, theRowingOut dawn transition, the charged final paragraph) and imagery is often specific ("tarnished brass," "bruise of cerulean," "encrusted with barnacles"). Paragraph structure modulates purposefully. Deductions: paraphrase loop at "The islet's breeze picked up, carrying the scent of wet kelp" immediately after "the breeze carried the damp tang of post-rain earth"; the phrase "tides of remembrance" recurs three times without reweighting; and the final beat's "the quiet" and "hearts finally at peace" summarize rather than show the new equilibrium. Template cadence in the lace-stitching sequence ("The first thread… Next… And") reads instructional but voice-motivated, so no large penalty.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, with evocative metaphors that remain coherent and grounded in Elara’s dual domains (waveform of a dying pulsar, fungal hyphae as accretion disks). Sentences carry multiple functions—world-building, character, and theme—without obvious padding or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but controlled enough that it doesn’t blur sense or stall movement. A few abstractions and summary phrases near the end slightly reduce the immediacy of the closure but do not materially dull the central image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have varied cadence, dense yet generally efficient imagery, and few if any true scaffold or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are mostly coherent and aligned with the story’s material palette (fire, glass, frost, stars), and syntax remains readable even when lush. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition around “pauses,” “purpose,” and “hidden maps,” especially near the end, but it doesn’t obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. Tightening a few abstract restatements would elevate an already polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences are generally well-shaped and purposeful, with vivid yet controlled imagery (“walls glazed with ice that refracted the dim glow of the sunless sky”) that does multiple jobs at once. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence despite a consistently lyrical style. A few constructions verge on explanatory or slightly overpacked (e.g., restating her motivation in abstract terms in the final third), which lightly softens momentum and sharpness. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publishable, if not yet at the razor-edged precision of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and largely free of scaffolding; images like “books floated like jellyfish” and “cracks mended with gold leaf, like scars turned to art” are effective and concrete. There’s some mild tendency toward slogan-esque lines and abstract moralizing in the final paragraphs, but not enough to seriously cloud the closure image. Information density is solid for the length, with minimal redundancy and no major figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, vivid, and purposeful, with strong images like “hope frayed like old rope” and the bell “humm[ing] faintly in her grip.” Information density is high without becoming opaque; most sentences do multiple jobs of setting, character, and theme. There is some mild explanatory repetition in the later paragraphs, but not enough to drag momentum significantly. Figurative language is used selectively enough that it doesn’t tip into purple or muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with some strong images (e.g., “last light of day clung to the stone arches like a secret”). There is a tendency toward ornate description and repeated structures (“The taste was bitter, then sweet, then gone…”) that occasionally feels like mild purple prose but doesn’t obscure meaning. Redundancies are limited, and syntax remains varied enough to keep momentum. Tightening some figurative language and trimming explanatory lines, especially around the epiphany, would elevate it for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory density and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and world-building (“petals unfolded in slow-motion symphonies,” “breeze that tasted of salt and regret”). A few phrases lean toward purple or abstracted (“quaking reverie,” “texture of time”) but do not seriously muddy causality or image clarity. Sentence rhythms are varied and momentum generally holds, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The closing paragraphs, though a touch declarative, remain clean and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is clean: sentences are grammatical, sequencing is logical, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is present but not overwhelmingly purple, and most images are coherent and purposeful. Some phrases trend generic or slightly over-familiar (“her mind racing,” “burned in her chest”), and the rhythm doesn’t vary as dynamically as top-tier work; the prose rarely surprises at the sentence level. Still, it moves efficiently and supports the story without serious artifacts or opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, varied, and information-dense, and the metaphorical language tends to be coherent and purposeful. Images like “liquid mercury” aurora and “crucible” of absences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme). That said, the prose edges toward purple in places, with a high density of figurative phrasing that slightly risks saturation, especially given relatively low external stakes. Trimming a few metaphors or tightening some descriptive clauses would sharpen momentum without sacrificing the lush texture.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images are vivid, sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, and theme), and there is little redundant scaffolding or obvious synonym-churn. The light and illumination metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, supporting the conceit rather than drifting into purple excess. Rhythm is varied enough to maintain momentum, and there are no significant grammatical or logical slips. A touch of tightening—especially where similar ideas about light and destiny are reiterated—would push this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences carry both image and character, as in the bookmark’s crack becoming a “map” or the machinery “choked with ice.” Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and not overstacked; rhythm varies naturally, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. A couple of lines flirt with familiar inspirational phrasing, but they don’t seriously obscure clarity or momentum. Overall, line-level craft is at or near publishable quality for a literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, with varied syntax and strong, specific images like “their pages yellowed like old wounds” and “voice smooth as poison.” Exposition is mostly efficient, and there’s little redundancy or clutter. The main weakness is occasional thematic overstatement that replaces image with abstraction, particularly in the final beats. Still, there are no serious artifacts or clarity issues, and momentum is largely well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: images like “stone teeth gnawing at the wind” and “ambered hush” feel precise, and most sentences do multiple jobs (mood, setting, character) without padding. There is a high density of figurative language, but it’s mostly controlled and thematically unified around silence, sea, and decay rather than showy for its own sake. Repetition of phrases (“mildly obsessed,” “hush”) reads as motif rather than loop. Clarity and momentum are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical, with strong images like “fountains frozen mid-splash” and “droplets freezing mid-air and reforming into new shapes.” Some phrasing tilts toward mild abstraction or repetition (“remarkably composed,” “amalgamate,” “second chance program”) without adding new pressure. Figurative language is controlled and mostly coherent with the conceit; there’s little genuine purple excess or scaffolding. Overall, line-level craft is solid and publishable, if not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic, with few if any syntactic or grammatical missteps, and most sentences do more than one job. Occasional phrases veer toward the generic or explanatory (e.g., some of the thematic restatements, “gleamed like a promise”), but they don’t seriously drag momentum. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and action remains clear. Trimming a few summarizing or moralizing lines would further sharpen an already solid line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally smooth, with good sentence rhythm and efficient description that often carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, character). Minor issues—“withered vine dresser” being confusingly reused as both role and object, a small grammar slip (“Elara polish”), and some platitudinous lines—nick the polish but don’t derail clarity. Figurative language is controlled rather than overwrought, and momentum is maintained without noticeable scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally well shaped and efficient, with most lines doing double duty for mood and information, and there are no serious clarity or grammar issues. A few metaphors and repetitions (“icy warmth,” “hush of beating wings,” the taffy-time simile) flirt with purple prose but do not obscure causality or pacing. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn; the scene moves forward without obvious loops. The line-level work is solid and publication-ready, if not yet distinctive or ruthlessly pared.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“sheet music floating like lost confessions,” “cello bow…its strings glistening like spider silk”) and generally efficient sentences that do multiple jobs at once. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum; description is integrated rather than pausing the scene. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or incoherent, and there are few to no paraphrase loops or scaffolding artifacts. A touch more variation in imagery and slightly tighter trimming of reiterated concepts (e.g., “in-between spaces”) would refine it further.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and musical, with varied syntax and strong information density; images typically do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphor density is high but controlled, and recurrent vehicles (roots, margins, storm) stay coherent rather than muddled. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn; most sentences move something—emotion, image, or plot—forward. At the very highest tiers one might want one or two more sharp, surprising phrasings instead of familiar constructions, but line-level craft is already above most submissions.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, vivid, and purposeful, with few wasted beats; description, action, and interiority are well-balanced. Metaphors like “the hush that followed a sudden confession” and “dawn bled through the ivy” largely work and support tone without becoming purple. There is minor abstraction in places (“the weight of a swallowed truth,” “religiously skeptical”), but it does not obscure clarity or momentum. Tightening a few slightly familiar phrasings and trimming one or two high-level statements could polish the piece to a truly elite shine.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite the lush imagery, and metaphors are coherent and sensorially grounded (“roots dangled like question marks,” “pocket of stillness”). There is some mild redundancy and metaphor stacking (“crumbling peace” repeated; several entropy images in close proximity), but it doesn’t significantly clog momentum or obscure sense. Information density is good—most lines carry both atmosphere and character. A touch more restraint in figurative clustering around key beats would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and a good ratio of concrete action to image. Metaphors are mostly apt and not overstacked; the few repeated phrases read as framing devices, not artifacts. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym churn, and each paragraph generally advances either atmosphere or emotional movement. Occasional slightly purple touches and on-the-nose lines prevent it from feeling fully distilled for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and generally economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“their pages curled like dying leaves,” “dragons coiled in mid-flight”). Rhythm varies well across longer, descriptive lines and short, charged beats at the climax (“A low hum filled the silo, vibrating through the floorboards and into his bones”). There’s a mild risk of purple at moments (“displaced axis of truth,” “bronze quiet”), but metaphors are internally coherent and not stacked to the point of muddling clarity. Information flows cleanly without obvious scaffolding or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lean yet vivid, with most sentences doing double duty (world-building plus character, or atmosphere plus theme) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language like “The lighthouse beam carved through fog like a silver blade” and “directing the flow of fate like a maestro” is apt and not overstacked. There are no glaring rhythm artifacts or clarity issues; the narrative flows smoothly. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing around “flow,” “fate,” and “open secrets” keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmic, with many lines accomplishing multiple tasks (worldbuilding, theme, and action) at once. There is some purple-leaning density and repetition of structurally similar aphorisms that restate the same ideas about stillness, silence, and hidden assumptions without always adding pressure. Nevertheless, clarity is never lost, and the closure image is sharp and legible. Minor paraphrase loops and high figurative concentration in peak beats keep it just below top-tier line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, interiority, theme) with good rhythm, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few images and concepts recur with near-identical phrasing (“mirrored horizon,” “unheard symphonies,” “love letter”) that slightly approach self-paraphrase and sentimentality. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and grounded in the established motifs; it rarely muddies sense. The closing cadence lands cleanly and feels earned by prior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with strong sensory anchors in the opening and closing and few outright redundancies; sentences usually carry more than one piece of work (setting, emotion, and concept intertwined). There is some tendency toward abstraction and repeated locutions (“labyrinth of self,” “fractured timelines,” “procedural generation”) that could be pared or grounded in fresher, more concrete language. Figurative density is moderate and mostly coherent, so momentum holds and closure isn’t dulled. Line-level craft is strong but not at the razor-honed level of elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences do double duty for mood and information, and there is little visible scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language (“filament of hush,” “palimpsest of emotion”) is mostly precise and thematically apt, with no major mixed metaphors or purple excess. Sentence variety and paragraphing keep the rhythm from becoming monotonous despite the contemplative pace. A few lines state theme or emotion directly where image might suffice, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and readable, with good rhythm and a reasonable balance of description and action. There are occasional familiar phrases (“charged with something he couldn’t name,” “heart pounding”) and some thematic telling, but no major loops, clutter, or figurative muddle. Information density is solid; most lines do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or plot). The prose is polished enough for competitive markets, though it doesn’t quite achieve a distinctive stylistic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level writing is generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmic, with strong sensory specificity and minimal redundancy. Figurative language is present but not overwhelmingly purple, and most sentences do more than one job (world, character, mood). There are a few slightly stock formulations and thematic restatements in the final third that feel like scaffolding rather than pressure (“She’d always thought… but now she saw it as a gift”), softening the closure’s impact. Nonetheless, momentum and clarity are preserved throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense without collapsing into incoherence; many sentences do double duty for image and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and thematically aligned (ropes as maps, time as tapestry, walls as ancient skin). There’s mild purple-prose risk and a few near-platitudinous phrases, yet momentum is preserved and the closure image is clear and strong. I see no major loops or scaffolding that drag pace or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and high-density: most sentences do double duty for setting, mood, and theme without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful; images like “a glass cathedral among the rusted shipwrecks” or “a chronic hush that softened the edges of ruin” sharpen rather than blur meaning. Momentum is maintained even through lyric description, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. A mild tendency toward lushness keeps it just short of top-tier minimalism, but clarity and cadence hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong specific nouns (amber crystals, blotter petal, liquid moonlight) carrying much of the load. A few lines verge on purple or redundant (“static charge of dusk’s first sigh,” “professionally thorough nature demanded”) but they do not seriously obscure meaning or stall momentum. Information density is good; most sentences advance either world, character, or mood without obvious scaffolding loops. The final paragraph lands crisply, though the “quiet satisfaction of a job well done” edges toward summary rather than a more image-driven close.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere + characterization + theme), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are mostly coherent and apt (sea, tides, invisible crew), though a few lines drift toward overtly “writerly” or aphoristic turns that feel slightly on-the-nose. Rhythm is varied and readable; paragraphs cut logically with good momentum for a reflective piece. There’s mild sentimentality in the closing cadences, but not enough to significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with good rhythm and information density; most sentences do more than one job and maintain forward motion. Some figurative language verges on purple or accumulative (“luminescent ache,” “murmur of lost languages,” “liquid light”) without always adding new pressure, but it rarely undermines clarity. There are no notable redundancies, scaffold sentences, or syntactic glitches, and the final lines land cleanly. A bit more variation between lush description and plainer, pressure-focused language could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is clean, grammatical, and mostly lean; sentences often carry multiple functions (world-building and emotion, for instance) without obvious scaffolding. Metaphors like “a silver serpent” or “a compressed slice of eternity” are concrete enough to land, and figurative density stays within bounds for clarity. There are mild tendencies toward abstraction and familiar formulations (“This was it—the moment to act,” “its work done”), but they don’t seriously impede momentum or closure. With some pruning of slightly generic phrasing, this could move into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“fruit that shimmered like liquid starlight,” “a current in the air, a vibration in the sap’s glow”) and generally efficient sentences that do dual work for mood and meaning. There is some repetition of conceptual frames (mosaic, fractal, preservation vs. flow) and a few lines tilt toward over-articulated abstraction, but they don’t significantly impede momentum or clarity. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are no notable mechanical errors or figurative muddles. Tightening a few explanatory sentences could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Some figurative language edges toward purple or repetition (“sapphire hush” appears twice; “sense memory” is told rather than fully embodied), but it doesn’t materially obscure action or stakes. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym churn; most sentences advance either world, mood, or plot. With a bit more restraint on overt restatement in the closing paragraphs, this would approach elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is clean, with good information density and minimal redundancy; sentences usually do more than one job. Sensory and figurative language is mostly controlled and apt, and there are no major clarity issues or loops. A few phrases feel self-conscious or repeated (“circuitously sincere,” reiterated thematic statements), which slightly dulls impact. Still, the prose supports momentum and mood without obvious artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, vivid but mostly disciplined metaphors, and minimal redundancy keep momentum while maintaining atmosphere. Phrases like “silhouette frayed at the edges like a watercolor left too long in the sun” and “brushes dipped in starlight” are inventive yet legible. There is some density of figurative language, but it doesn’t tip into muddle or obvious padding, and information density is high for the length. No major loops, scaffolding, or mechanical errors interfere with clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and tightly controlled, with varied syntax and strong verbs; most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent with the established imagery of sound, light, and crystal, without slipping into muddled metaphor. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm accelerates appropriately around the pearl’s activation and aftermath. A few phrasings (“beauty from chaos,” “unseen forces are fickle”) brush cliché, but they don’t significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with strong opening and closing images and minimal grammatical noise. Many sentences multitask—advancing setting, concept, and character at once—without clear scaffold or synonym loops. Some lines lean toward abstraction and mild repetition (“staggered intervals,” “reactively visionary,” “fragments into meaning”), and the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than trusting prior images. Nonetheless, line-level control is above average and never obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with generally strong rhythm, varied syntax, and purposeful figurative language (e.g., the mist as a “sleeping giant’s” breath). Line-level density is high but rarely overwrought, and most sentences pull multiple duties (setting, character, theme) without padding. Minor redundancies and familiar constructions (“trembling certainty”) keep it from feeling fully distinctive at the most granular level. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and there are no major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and purposeful, with minimal redundancy and clear sequencing of action and perception. Imagery like the tile’s shifting grid and the whales’ hymnal calls is concrete enough to avoid purple-prose territory, and most sentences do more than one job (advancing scene and mood). A few abstractions (“resilience,” “unheard symphonies,” “sculpt space for reflection”) create slight distance and flirt with sentimentality, particularly in the closing paragraphs. Still, momentum is maintained and no major loops or artifacts blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and usually carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character in one move). Figurative language like “spatial mutiny” and “prison of light and shadow where time folded in on itself” is vivid without tipping into muddle. There are a few slightly abstract or familiar phrases (“symphony of possibilities”), but they don’t derail momentum or clarity. There’s little observable scaffolding or redundancy; the prose mostly feels publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are clean, grammatical, and mostly free of redundancy, with some efficient dual-purpose lines that carry both mood and information. Figurative language is restrained and generally apt; there’s no major purple-prose or metaphor muddle, and momentum is rarely bogged down. The main weakness is a certain plainness and occasional slogan-level phrasing that blunts the impact of big thematic beats. Line-level craft is solid and unobtrusive but doesn’t yet deliver the precision or surprise characteristic of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and rich in concrete detail (e.g., paste from violets and pine sap, banknote fragments), with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple or obscure meaning, and there are few if any scaffold or paraphrase loops. Occasionally the modifiers pile up (“blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests on a mountaintop,” “incandescent restraint”) in ways that feel ornamental rather than pressured by scene needs. Overall, though, it’s strong line-level work that would need only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with vivid images doing multiple jobs (e.g., “Errors didn’t erase histories; they buried them” simultaneously characterizes and thematizes). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright purple excess. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. A slight tendency toward repeating certain abstractions (“fragments,” “labyrinth”) shows but doesn’t seriously drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is precise and image-rich without tipping into incoherent purple; metaphors are generally apt and anchored (“like a fossilized question,” “like a memory trying to reform”). Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without redundancy or visible scaffolding loops. Momentum is maintained even through reflective passages; exposition about the astronomer’s past obsession is compact and purposeful. A few high-density lines flirt with ornament, but they don’t blur causality or the climactic image.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, concise, and image-rich without obvious loops or scaffolding; most sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, and character). The opening and closing images are strong and well-matched, giving the piece a pleasing symmetry via the chip and the alleys. A few phrases brush cliché (“a flicker of hope”) or present mild telliness, but they don’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity. Line-level control is solid and publishable, if not yet dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and purposeful: sentences are varied, concrete detail is well-chosen, and most lines carry at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). There are a few mildly redundant or slightly clichéd constructions (e.g., “outlasted the indifference of the cosmos,” “dawnlit melancholy”) but they don’t significantly stall momentum or muddle imagery. Rhythm overall supports the contemplative pace, and key moments (the dissolving grain, the archivist’s discovery) are rendered with clear, economical language. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, just short of strikingly original.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and economical, with vivid but not over-stacked imagery (“mist clung to the rail depot like a second skin,” “iridescence flashing like liquid sunlight”) and minimal redundancy. Information density is good: most lines do double duty for worldbuilding and character without obvious scaffolding or loops. Rhythm varies naturally and clarity is never in doubt, including during the technical repair sequence. The prose is strong and publication-ready, if more workmanlike than dazzling in its most crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, precise diction, and images that usually do double duty (worldbuilding plus mood or theme). Metaphors like “the earth’s bones” and “veins of liquid fire” are vivid without devolving into purple excess, and there is little scaffolding or repetition. Transitions are smooth and information-dense, maintaining momentum despite reflective passages. A few formulations verge on familiar (“iron sky,” “ghostly plume”), but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical without becoming opaque, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and motion at once). Figurative language (“wild hush,” “tapestry of shared balance”) is generally apt and not over-stacked. There’s minimal redundancy and no serious syntactic artifacts or clarity issues, especially at the close. The style is slightly lush but remains readable and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and movement) without bloated scaffolding, and imagery (“secrets coiled like eels in the dark”) is vivid and concrete. Rhythm varies appropriately, and there are no major clarity issues or loops. Some metaphors and formulations land closer to familiar shorthand (“weight of a crown,” “time was a river,” “where they belonged”), slightly diluting the otherwise fresh diction. Trimming a few near-clichés and on-the-nose abstractions at the end would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level work is generally strong: varied sentence structures, high information density, and vivid but legible metaphors. There is consistent figurative richness (“skeleton of stone and regret,” “a bell tolling in reverse”), bordering on purple in places, yet it rarely confuses meaning or stalls momentum. Repetition feels thematic rather than looped scaffolding, and there are no glaring syntactic or clarity issues. I’d trim a few metaphor stacks for maximal sharpness, but the prose is already at a quality suitable for competitive venues.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong: rich imagery, varied syntax, and good momentum for a lyric piece, with most sentences carrying both atmosphere and information. There is some tendency toward purple stacking of modifiers and metaphors, but they remain coherent and rarely obscure sense. Repetitions like “ephemeral cameo appearances” and a few abstract labels could be pared back for even tighter density. Crucially, no major loops or figurative muddles undercut the climax, and the final images land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, and information) with little redundancy, and rhythm varies nicely. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and legible; it rarely tips into muddle or self-indulgence. There are no obvious scaffold phrases or looping paraphrases that sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is clean, with strong verbs and specific nouns doing most of the work (“roots twisting like serpents through ribcages and skulls”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and paragraphs are well-shaped, maintaining momentum despite the reflective, accumulative mode. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic artifacts that obscure meaning. A few motifs (roots, bones) recur frequently, but they function thematically rather than as redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and rhythmic: images like “honeyed streaks across cobblestone floors” and “dawn’s light refracted through the water, casting prismatic patterns” are evocative without overwhelming clarity. Sentences tend to do multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, mood, and plot—so momentum rarely stalls. There are a few slightly expository or on-the-nose lines, especially in the final third, but they don’t create confusion or significant drag. No noticeable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle interfere with the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally tight, and pull double duty for mood and information (“needles darted like comets, weaving threads of luminescent gold…” is representative). There’s some flirtation with purple prose, but metaphors are coherent and domain-consistent rather than mixed for effect. The prose rarely loops or restates; each paragraph adds a new facet of world, character, or concept. A slightly greater contrast in rhythm at high-pressure beats could sharpen momentum, but readability and control are already high.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are vivid, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, and the prose avoids major mixed metaphors or syntactic clutter. There is mild redundancy around the core ideas of healing and unsent words, and a few abstractions could be thinned without loss. Overall momentum and clarity remain intact, with no significant artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally precise and evocative, with strong images (“reef bombed into silence,” “the dark is just the world holding its breath”) and a good balance of sentence rhythms. Most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing emotion, theme, and setting together—without obvious scaffold or repetition. There is a mild tendency toward elevated abstractions and coined terms that edge near purple, but they stay just this side of controlled. Momentum holds throughout, and the final image is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a good balance between concrete image and abstraction. Most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few phrases veer toward familiar poetic shorthand (e.g., “tasted like sunshine”) but are offset by fresher specifics like encrypted notes and light-words chased by children. The final cadence is strong and clear, avoiding figurative muddle or over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and character. Figurative language generally lands cleanly and suits the atmosphere; images like fissures beginning to “shimmer, as if the stone were breathing” are both clear and evocative. There is some mild abstraction and aphoristic phrasing toward the end, but it doesn’t significantly muddy the closure image or drag momentum. The prose could be tightened slightly by trimming a few explicit thematic statements, but there are no serious artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with only occasional drift toward purple (“greenhouse’s chaos converged”) that doesn’t seriously impede clarity. Description tends to do multiple jobs (world, mood, and plot) and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. A few phrases repeat ideas already implied, and intensifiers like “chaos converged into a symphony” feel slightly overdetermined, softening impact. Overall momentum is good, but a leaner, more pressured diction at the climactic beats would better fit the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences simultaneously build world, mood, and character. Metaphors are abundant but generally coherent and specific, keeping images vivid rather than muddy. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to sustain momentum despite the contemplative mode. The only limiting factor is the near-constant figurative richness, which occasionally risks feeling ornamental rather than pressured but never quite tips into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is dense but controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“light fractured through stained-glass shelves into prismatic whispers”). Rhythm varies well, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy; almost every line advances mood or stakes. Some metaphors verge on ornate (“opalescent static,” “foxglove regret”), but they stay within a coherent imagistic field and do not obscure sense or causality. Overall momentum holds, and the final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich without tipping fully into purple; phrases like “its script so faded it resembled lace” and “my heart is a river that flows only toward you” work well in context. Information density is solid—most sentences do double duty for character, atmosphere, and theme, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Some abstractions (“symphony of truth,” repeated invocations of “promises” and “trust”) recur enough to feel a touch over-signaled, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Line-level control is strong and easily at or near publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images like “the building breathed—a low, rhythmic groan” and “dappled resolve shimmering like volcanic glass,” and it generally maintains clarity. There is some density of metaphor and motif repetition (the amphitheater’s breath, the chain clicking) that borders on over-insistent and could be tightened without loss. Nonetheless, sentences usually do double duty for mood and information, and there are few genuine loops or scaffolding lines. Rhythm is varied enough that the piece reads smoothly aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, images are controlled and usually do more than one job, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language (dust as galaxies, songs shifting like sand, horizon as a “line of balance”) is thematically aligned and not so dense as to blur sense. A few phrases are familiar (“his fingers trembling,” “his chest tightened”), but they don’t materially dull the prose or the closure image. Overall, the writing would require minimal editing for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with imagery that usually does more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and character lens at once). Metaphors (“fractured hush,” grain “spiraled inward,” face a “mosaic of relief and regret”) are mostly fresh and coherent, with no major mixed or muddled figures. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; progression feels smooth rather than looped. The occasional coined phrase (“featherly determined”) is slightly mannered but functions as a motif rather than purple flourish, so it doesn’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally smooth, clear, and rhythmically varied, with some strong images (“pressure of the sea pressed like a gentle hand against glass,” “fireflies of summer” underwater). There is occasional redundancy and abstraction, especially in the final paragraphs where similar insights are restated in slightly different language. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure meaning. Tightening repetition and trimming a few platitudinal lines would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty by advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. Metaphors like “prismatic whispers” and “cheerful gloom” are vivid and for the most part coherent with the story’s logic. There is a mild tendency toward stacked figurative language and repeated explanatory phrasing around the same insight (e.g., reiterating reasons paths vanish) that could be trimmed for even greater impact. Still, no major loops or muddled images harm momentum or clarity, especially at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, precise, and economical given the lyric ambitions, and most metaphors (“neon signs flickering like nervous fish”) are vivid without clutter. Information density is high, with description usually doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There are a few slightly redundant explanatory phrases (e.g., reiterating the bishop is “not as symbol but weight/intent”), but they don’t significantly stall momentum. Overall, the prose easily meets a strong-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and generally efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and there are few if any true clunkers or clarity issues. Metaphor density runs high, yet most images are consistent and legible, though phrases like “obsidian grace” and “garden of stars” edge toward repetition. There’s mild purple-leaning lushness that occasionally softens momentum, particularly in the mid-story where description slightly outpaces pressure. Trimming a few adjectives and tightening one or two explanatory sentences (e.g., restating what fledge means) would sharpen propulsion without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, with smooth rhythm and clear syntax; sensory detail and internal reflection are well integrated. There is some conceptual and thematic repetition that could be tightened, particularly around “seeing the world anew” and “value in the mundane.” Figurative language is tasteful but safe, and a few lines verge on cliché or summary rather than fresh image. Strong line-level control is evident, but the density and surprise required for elite publication are not fully present.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with good rhythm, clear syntax, and multi-purpose sentences that advance atmosphere and psychology together. There is some purple edging and metaphor saturation (“spilled milk,” “language the stars might understand,” “hard softness a paradox”) that risks feeling overworked but does not obscure sense. Redundancy is low and momentum holds despite the reflective mode, helped by concrete images like frost-laced gravel and the frozen hourglass. Line-level craft is strong but not yet at the taut, surprising precision of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid yet mostly coherent (“saltwater pooled like liquid mercury,” “needle…like a second heartbeat”) and sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without overt redundancy. There is some density of metaphor and elevated language, but it stops short of purple and does not obscure cause-and-effect. Rhythm and paragraphing support the gentle escalation from preparation to launch to realization. Minor trims could heighten sharpness, but there are no serious artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, mostly economical, and often do double duty with image and theme. The figurative density is high but rarely tips into muddle, with metaphors (throat/food, spine of a map, walls dreaming) forming a coherent image system. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax variation keeps the piece from feeling mechanical. The main ceiling is that a few lines veer toward familiar lyrical phrasing rather than the startlingly precise, which keeps it just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, sensory images are clear, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once). The prose occasionally edges toward lushness but stops short of purple; metaphors are coherent and consistent with the world’s logic. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final images land cleanly. A slightly sharper pruning of a few descriptive phrases in the midsection could heighten momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with smooth rhythm, clean grammar, and evocative imagery; sentences usually do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“price of redemption,” “flawed beauty,” “anchor ideals in practice”) and slightly purple leanings, but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum at this length. Descriptive density is high yet generally purposeful, and there are few, if any, true scaffold or synonym loops. Tightening a handful of thematic restatements would sharpen propulsion without altering the core effect.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery around cracks, salt, and echoes is coherent and avoids mixed metaphors; repetition of key terms reads as deliberate motif, not loop. There are a few slightly expository or thesis-like sentences that could be pared for maximum impact, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing dual work for mood and action. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically unified (threads, echoes, light, lullaby), though it occasionally edges toward purple and redundancy. There are a few paraphrastic moments (“her bodily poetic movements could unravel the very air” then restated by similar images) that could be tightened. Nonetheless, momentum holds, and no metaphor stack meaningfully obscures the action or closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically considered, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and legible, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffold left on the page. Phrases like “meteor hush of the projections” and “serifed verses smooth as lies” are memorable without tangling meaning. The mild weakness is a slight over-reliance on standalone aphoristic lines, which can flatten momentum, but this doesn’t significantly obscure cause/effect or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, sensory, and often do double duty for atmosphere and character, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language (“mist curled like spun sugar,” migration “like a hymn”) is mostly effective and not excessively stacked. Some conceptual repetition and explicit abstraction in the final third (“overlooked histories,” “temporary structures as signals,” “transiently rooted beauty of existence”) slightly blunts the lyric charge and could be tightened. Still, momentum and clarity remain intact, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language (“as if remembering sunlight,” “memory, he’d learned, was a braid of light and shadow”) is vivid and mostly precise, without muddled or mixed metaphors. There’s slight risk of ornamental lushness, but momentum generally holds and each paragraph advances pressure or reweights meaning. No significant scaffolding, loops, or clarity issues interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, theme) and rhythm modulates well between description and realization. There are occasional purple or abstract turns (“her footsteps echoing in the rhythm of rebirth,” “a directive in motion, a hymn to the walkers”) and some paraphrastic reiteration of the same conceptual insight. These moments slightly dull momentum and introduce a faint sense of overstatement. Still, clarity remains high and most images are precise rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery is consistently concrete and evocative (dust-caked walls, bioluminescent light, numbers flaring into constellations), and syntax remains clear even when figurative. There is some risk of purple or conceptual heaviness, especially in compressed phrases like “dusky harmony” and “encrypted devotion,” but it rarely obscures sense or momentum. Line-level craft feels submission-ready for many venues, though an ultra-demanding market might pare a few abstract formulations.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and free of major syntactic or clarity issues; sentences tend to do at least two jobs (world, theme, or character) without obvious scaffolding. There are some strong images (“time bending like taffy,” “a heart soft as moss”), though the figurative register edges toward uniform softness and abstraction. Therapy- and concept-language (“cellular memory,” “teach resentment to release”) occasionally flatten texture, but not enough to derail momentum. No serious looping or artifact patterns appear, and the final cadence lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a strong sensory palette; most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding, tone, and motion at once). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There are no evident scaffold phrases, synonym loops, or structural artifacts bogging down momentum. A bit more sparing use of modifiers in a few spots could heighten impact further, but line-level craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and free of serious grammatical or syntactic artifacts; it reads smoothly aloud. There is some repetition of thematic phrasing and mild purple-leaning description (“language only the wind understood,” “liquid starlight”) that skews toward familiar lyricism rather than sharp, surprising image. Nonetheless, most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, character) and maintain momentum. The final paragraphs could be tightened to avoid summarizing what’s already implied, but they do not significantly blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; images like “waterfall of liquid light” and soil that “pulsed with a faint, blue glow” are evocative without becoming convoluted. Most sentences do more than one job—advancing plot while building atmosphere or character. Occasional borderline-purple or thesis-like lines (“Forbidden knowledge,” “Some truths were meant to be lived, not exhibited”) slightly blunt the subtlety but do not materially harm momentum or clarity. There’s little to no scaffold, repetition, or figurative muddle, especially near the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with strong images that do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding (the live spiders in a hollow spine; the guardian’s blank-page face). Sentence rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and there’s little to no scaffold, redundancy, or filter-verb clutter. A few phrases edge toward purple or explanatory in the last lines, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or dull the closure. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, though not so strikingly controlled as to warrant 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images vivid, and most lines carry dual duty for mood and meaning. Phrases such as “its peeling paint and broken lanterns whispering of better days” and the twin-petaled flower are striking and precise. There is some mild purple/abstract phrasing (“unkindled solace,” “blissfully aberrant dream,” “symbiosis of chaos and order”) that gestures rather than dramatizes. Still, clarity and propulsion are not harmed, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong images (“air hummed with the weight of centuries,” “torches flared, their light merging into a single, brilliant beam”) and mostly efficient sentences that advance both mood and action. There is some tendency toward familiar elevated phrases and light purple touches, but figurative language is not so dense as to muddy clarity. Information density is good: each paragraph generally carries multiple functions (setting, interiority, plot). With a slight trim of abstract or personified lines, this would be fully publication-ready at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and action) with few redundancies, and figurative language tends to be clear and coherent (“living static,” “drowning in velvet”). The repetition of sound-related imagery feels pattern-driven rather than like a loop, and there are no major syntactic or grammatical slips. A few moments skirt purple-prose density, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or slow momentum at this length. With slightly more pruning of modifers and micro-repetitions, this would approach top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do at least two jobs (world, mood, and character) without bloating. Recurring metaphors (shards, song, hush) are consistent and non-muddled, and purple tendencies are mostly kept in check. There’s minor redundancy in reiterating the prism’s original function and Elara’s hope, but not to the level of loops or scaffolding. Grammar and clarity are clean, and the closure image lands crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in rhythm, and usually do more than one job (advancing scene, character, and atmosphere together). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, and momentum is preserved despite the reflective mode. Minor redundancy and a few conventional images keep it just short of top-tier, but there are no significant artifacts or loops dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, image-rich, and mostly high-density; sentences often carry worldbuilding, mood, and character at once. There is some flirtation with purple prose and familiar metaphor (“tapestry of color,” “velvet void”), and figurative language is quite dense, but it rarely muddies sense. Momentum is maintained despite the lushness, and there are no evident scaffolding loops or mechanical cadences. A touch more restraint in peak beats could actually enhance impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verb choices, and images that carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, theme) without obvious padding. Description is dense but rarely feels purple; most metaphors are coherent and grounded in the sea/tide domain. Momentum holds despite reflection, in part because it’s anchored to concrete stimuli and small on-page actions. Occasional abstract phrases and near-repetitions (“transition periods,” “pause”) keep this just short of exceptional concision and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong sensory images and metaphors that usually pull double duty (the doll as both relic and seed, silence as flavor). Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and paragraphing supports momentum from countdown through inversion to the quiet coda. There is mild explanatory redundancy around “gilded hush” and “intangibly tangible,” but no real scaffolding loops or figurative muddle that hampers clarity. Line-level craft is solid and occasionally striking, if a touch self-conscious in places.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without major clutter, and rhythm varies well. A few moments veer toward purple or abstract (“a cocoon of possibility,” “canvas for comfort”), and some thematic phrases repeat concept rather than add new pressure, but they don’t seriously obscure meaning. There are no evident scaffolding loops or mechanical cadences, and the final image lands clearly. Overall, polished and controlled, if a touch ornate in places.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally tight, sensory-rich, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and story (“the paint flaked away like old skin,” “time was a thief”). There is some tendency toward explicit scaffolding or explanation, especially where metaphors are unpacked rather than allowed to resonate, and a few slightly purple or redundant constructions (“wisely adventurous—a paradox…”). Still, clarity and momentum hold throughout; description rarely stalls the scene. Sharpening a handful of explanatory lines and trimming repetition would move this into a more elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm, strong verb choices, and sensory density doing multiple jobs at once. Phrases like “air tasted of old smoke and forgotten prayers” and “loaded emptiness” are vivid without becoming muddled, and there is minimal scaffolding or repetition. A few abstractions and reiterated formulations (“burned bridges carefully,” “fading thresholds”) skirt the edge of thematic labeling rather than fresh image. Overall, line-level craft is strong and readable, though not yet at the razor-precise level of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences are generally tight, vivid, and multi-tasking—worldbuilding, mood, and character often coexist in a single line. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and not so dense as to become purple; rhythm has healthy variation without obvious template-cadence artifacts. There are a few slightly on-the-nose or slogan-like phrases (“the void is a suggestion,” “financial freedom cult”) that edge toward cleverness over depth, but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive markets, with room to trim one or two expository or thematic restatements.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often striking (“the quiet between notes, the space where meaning pooled like ink”), with a high information density relative to length. Sentences generally do more than one job—evoking atmosphere while advancing character and plot—and the rhythm reads well aloud. However, there is a mild tendency toward purple repetition of certain motifs (“golden shadows,” “sepia,” abstract phrases like “bridge of intuition”) and occasional overclarifying phrases near the end that slightly blunt impact. These are minor slips; overall line-level craft is strong and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus mood plus theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and legible, not obscuring causality. There’s minimal redundancy, and the prose maintains momentum through descriptive density. A few formulations skirt purple, yet they don’t significantly dull clarity or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. The prose avoids obvious loops or scaffold and rarely wastes a line; details like “corners curled where hands had lingered” efficiently advance both setting and theme. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no mixed metaphors or rhythm-breaking artifacts. A tiny amount of repetition around Elias’s long familiarity with “gaps” and “absence” keeps it from feeling razor-honed at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: vivid images (“steel vultures,” “molten gold,” bioluminescent algae) and efficient action beats keep momentum moving. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and sentence variety works well across description and action. A few phrases lean toward familiar shorthand (“heart pounded,” “didn’t flinch”) but they don’t meaningfully blunt clarity or closure. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no major logical or grammatical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level prose is polished, with strong images like “a lattice of colors that shimmered like a ghost’s whisper” and the water drip as “natural metronome.” There is some risk of purple prose and adjective stacking, but it largely avoids mixed metaphors or outright muddle. Redundancies are minimal, and most sentences carry multiple burdens (setting, emotion, and theme together), maintaining momentum despite the lyricism. A bit more pruning of overtly explanatory lines in the closing paragraphs could heighten impact, but nothing seriously drags or confuses.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and largely free of scaffolding or loops; most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious padding. Occasional heightened phrases (“the hush where past met prophecy,” “emerging transformed always”) flirt with purple but remain coherent and thematically apt. Rhythm is well-managed, with no mechanical template cadences or confusing figurative tangles. It’s just shy of the highest band because the density of ornament slightly softens momentum in a piece whose conflict is already gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, vivid verbs, and multi-tasking sentences that carry setting, mood, and character at once. There are a few paraphrase-y moves and slightly purple moments (“the ghost of fertilizer and neglect”), but they don’t seriously obscure sense or drag momentum. The reflective closing paragraphs grow a bit abstract and could be tightened, particularly where they restate the lesson about uncertainty. Still, the prose remains clear, and the final image of clockwork flowers is clean and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is polished, with few if any syntactic or clarity issues, and most sentences carry more than one function (image + emotion + world). There is some tendency toward purple or stacked abstraction (“starlight and regret,” “factually mystical blend,” repeated statements about the weight of names), but it doesn’t obscure meaning. Redundancies are minor, and momentum is generally maintained without scaffold-like phrasing or loops. Stronger restraint in the most thematic sentences would elevate the prose further.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythms, clean syntax, and images that usually do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme). A few lines verge on purple or aphoristic repetition (“her heart a steady drum,” “like a candle in a storm,” “healing was not a destination”) and could be tightened. There are no serious clarity or momentum issues; the piece moves smoothly. Line-level refinement, especially pruning clichés and explicit moral statements, would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, sensory density is high, and most images do more than one job (worldbuilding plus emotion plus theme). Occasional phrases push toward purple or repetition (“mathematics of mercy” is repeated very close to its first coinage; UV/penance/purification imagery stacks heavily), but clarity remains intact. There are no major scaffold sentences or synonym loops dragging momentum, and the final paragraphs land cleanly. Slight tightening of figurative clusters would make the prose feel more effortless at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures and strong, specific images that often do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. There is some density of metaphor (“tapestry of smoke,” “edges sharp yet soft, like a thought half-formed”) but it remains coherent and doesn’t tangle meaning or pacing. The narration avoids scaffold phrases and obvious repetition; each paragraph adds new information or pressure. The only drawback is a mild tendency toward over-explicit summarizing in the last lines, but it doesn’t significantly sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is clean, with a few striking images (“shadows stretch like old, thin hands”) and generally efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and action. There’s some repetition and mildly purple phrasing, especially around “cracks” and the ghosts’ metaphorical burden, but it doesn’t seriously bog momentum or clarity. The prose avoids major scaffolding, loops, or mixed metaphors. It’s solid and publishable, though not yet at a line-by-line standout level for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are clean, varied in rhythm, and densely informative, with metaphors that cohere to a tight imagistic set (glass, print, clouds, frost, sound). Most description does double duty, advancing atmosphere and world-building without stalling momentum. There are moments verging on purple or redundant abstraction (e.g., reiterations of reality being “negotiable” and eternity “compressed”), but they don’t seriously obscure clarity or the closure image. The final passages maintain readability and impact even under heavy figurative load.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is often striking—“sharp as regret,” “fungus of revolution,” “time’s cobalt haze”—with a high information density where images carry worldbuilding, theme, and mood simultaneously. Line-level clarity remains good despite the lyricism; causal relations between sentences are rarely obscured, and there is little paraphrase looping or dead scaffolding. Some metaphor stacking and adornment edges toward purple, particularly early on, but it doesn’t seriously bog momentum or muddle peaks. Overall the piece reads as polished and intentional, if not quite at the “nothing-to-cut” level of elite flash.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are often striking (“air thickening into a syrup of sound”), and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus mood plus character). Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and thematically aligned rather than purple for its own sake. There are a few aphoristic or slightly over-tidy formulations that momentarily feel like commentary rather than lived perception, yet they do not seriously drag momentum or clarity. Information density and rhythm would be publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and clear, with strong information density—most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character, or action plus theme). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors are coherent and on-theme. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the final lines land cleanly. A few abstractions could be pared back for even greater sharpness, but line-level craft is already above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid images, varied sentence rhythms, and reasonably high information density with minimal scaffolding. Phrases like “bruised sky,” “a crab with a clockwork heart,” and the temporal montage have a pleasing lyric intensity. There is some drift into conceptual or summary language (“Her perpetually learning brain raced,” “to see through layered meanings”) which slightly blunts immediacy and feels more like commentary than lived perception. Still, there are no serious loops or muddled metaphors, and the line-level craft would need only modest tightening for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely informative, and often do double duty in advancing both scene and theme. Figurative language (“autumn leaves clung… like fiery confetti,” “umbral tenderness”) is rich but generally precise and not so stacked as to become purple or muddled. There are no notable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and rhythm modulates well between scene and summary. A few abstractions (“restless energy that coiled in her chest”) lean familiar, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, information density is high, and most images pull double duty for mood and world-building (“tunnels twisted like intestines,” the “obsidian surface parted”). There’s very little scaffolding or repetition, and exposition is efficiently folded into present action. A few metaphors verge on purple but do not obscure clarity or causality. The final lines land cleanly and echo prior imagery without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and rhythmic, with most lines doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character at once). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and not so dense as to blur meaning, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler scaffolding. Information flow is clear, with clean syntax and punctuation; the prose sustains momentum despite being reflective. A slight tendency toward purple phrasing in places keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, information density is high, and most images do multiple jobs (setting, mood, theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and apt; it rarely tips into muddle or self-contradiction. There are no significant loops or scaffold sentences, and sequencing is clear. A few phrases skim purple, but they don’t obscure meaning or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images, varied sentence rhythm, and high information density—most lines carry both atmosphere and concept. A few phrases verge on purple or redundant (“a paradox she called ‘furiously tranquil,’” then re-explaining the mindset; reiterating the entropy paradox), and conceptual explanation occasionally slows momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent and aligned with the world’s logic, and there are no serious scaffolding or loop artifacts. Tightening some explanatory sentences around the vortex mechanics would lift the piece into a leaner, more powerful register.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with strong information density and minimal scaffolding. There are occasional clichés or slightly awkward phrases (“winds howled like lost souls,” “credibly curious nature”), but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Description and action are well interwoven, and sentence structure varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. The line-level craft is solidly publication-ready, if not aggressively distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with rich imagery (“shooting stars streaked like tears from the heavens”) and a good sense of cadence. Most sentences do at least two jobs—worldbuilding and emotion—keeping density high. However, some metaphors and abstractions pile up (“flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance,” “cosmic janitor”) in close proximity, pushing toward purple and occasionally repeating the same conceptual move. Tightening a few explanatory or redundant lines would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense without major redundancy or clutter. Imagery like “sun that had forgotten mercy” and “each shard glinting like a star” is vivid if somewhat familiar, but not muddled. There is mild abstraction and some repeated phrasing around “unspoken words” and “tangled covenant,” yet it doesn’t significantly stall momentum or cloud meaning. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and there are no obvious grammatical or sequencing issues.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “numbers had changed meaning” and mercury forming a perfect sphere are vivid and efficient, and most sentences carry at least two jobs (mood plus information or character). There is some slightly familiar phrasing (“talisman against the void,” “mosaic of moments, each one fragile and infinite”) that nudges toward the generic, but not enough to drag momentum. No major loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle interfere with clarity or closure. With a light trim of the most on-the-nose abstractions, this would be top-tier prose.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and image-rich (“silver veins of falling droplets,” “pale gold and iridescent”) with strong information density; most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, and rhythm on the page is pleasingly varied. There is a mild tendency toward lushness that borders on purple in places, yet clarity and momentum remain intact. No significant loops, template cadences, or grammatical slips blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence structure, high information density, and images that usually do double thematic and atmospheric work. Repetition (“gentle and systematic,” “brazen calm,” hum/heartbeat) feels patterned rather than accidental, reinforcing motif. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every sentence advances character, world, or pressure. A few lines nudge close to overt statement, but clarity and rhythm at the climax and ending remain crisp and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied in length, and frequently do double duty (worldbuilding plus mood or character). Metaphors are rich (“liquid mercury” eyes, “mind sharper than the storm’s edge”) yet remain legible and mostly controlled rather than overstacked. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or template cadence, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. A few abstractions (“synthetic nostalgia,” “emotional signature of ‘return’”) flirt with register drift but stay anchored enough in character and scene to avoid real drag.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with strong sensory specificity and generally efficient sentences doing multiple jobs at once. Lines like “their petals flickering like tiny flames” and “a fertilizer mixed from memories of the reef’s final gasp” are vivid without muddling sense. There is a high density of figurative language, which occasionally risks purple accumulation but does not obscure clarity or closure. Minimal scaffolding or repetition appears, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum through a quiet scene.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Sensory details (grooves in wax, kerosene lamp flicker, leaf’s veins) are concrete and avoid obvious cliché for the most part. There are occasional lapses into slightly purple or redundant phrasing and a few abstract formulations that could be tightened. Nonetheless, momentum holds, syntax varies reasonably, and no major artifacts blunt the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with good sentence variety and strong image-to-information density; most lines do at least two jobs (world, mood, or character). Figurative language is selective and mostly clean, with only an occasional familiar phrase and no real metaphor muddle or redundancy loops. Rhythm supports the contemplative tone without bogging down, and key beats (the glimpse, the grandmother’s departure, the final choice) are rendered concretely rather than summarized. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor polish needed.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally polished: vivid images, clean syntax, and efficient scene progression with little dead weight. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, and the prose rarely lapses into true purple or muddled metaphor. Information density is good—each paragraph tends to advance plot, world, and tone at once—without obvious loops or scaffolding sentences. A bit more restraint on stacked modifiers and a sharper sense of where to let the rhythm quicken under peak pressure would refine it further.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization (“where sound curled like smoke and secrets clung to the domed ceiling”). Figurative language is mostly clean and thematically aligned; there are no major mixed metaphors or clarity failures. A few lines verge on purple or redundant, and some abstract phrasing could be tightened without loss. Nonetheless, rhythm, syntax variety, and precision are strong enough for near-publishable line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose shows strong control over rhythm, with varied sentence lengths and high information density; most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery is generally precise and coherent, and figurative language, while frequent, seldom feels mixed or overwrought. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops; progression is clean and momentum rarely stalls. The density of metaphor verges on purple in places, and a couple of phrases lapse into mild cliché, but these do not materially blur the climax or closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, mostly high information density, and purposeful imagery (“threads that pulsed like living veins,” “tapestry of soundless forgiveness”). Prose rarely loops or pads, and description is well-woven with action. There is a mild tendency toward lushness and abstraction in key insights, but not enough to obscure clarity or momentum. The final paragraphs land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning (“a cavern half-hidden behind a waterfall, its walls etched with centuries of scribbled verses and half-finished sketches”). Information moves forward efficiently; there’s little scaffolding or obvious redundancy. Some metaphors stack a bit densely and sometimes echo the explicit thematic language, slightly blurring the line between lived perception and crafted rhetoric. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and the closing image of the canyon sighing into a new rhythm lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid metaphors, clean syntax, and good momentum, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some repetition and near-scaffold (“Between breaths… is where truth lives.” echoed and then re-explained; multiple kintsugi definitional lines) that slightly dulls sharpness. Figurative density approaches purple in places but remains intelligible and thematically aligned. Trimming a few explicit restatements would heighten impact without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and largely free of scaffolding or loops; sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) without obvious redundancy. Rhythm is varied enough, and images are generally clear and grounded, though a few phrases (“intimately aloof,” “tide of time”) drift toward mild purple abstraction. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, so momentum is maintained. Line-level work is strong and publication-ready, if not yet pushing into formally dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is controlled and rhythmic, with good variation and high information density; most lines serve at least two functions (world, mood, and character at once). Figurative language—“bruised sky,” “silent scream of tenderness”—skirts the edge of familiarity but is not stacked to the point of purple prose or confusion. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity breaks; the prose keeps momentum even while luxuriating in atmosphere. Minor intensifier excess in a few lines keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with vivid metaphor and minimal redundancy; most sentences are doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Rhythm modulates well between description and action, and the line-level clarity holds even in the more metaphorical beats. A few phrases flirt with purple (“raw solace of the task,” “wires humming with promise”), but they still track emotionally and don’t gum up momentum. There are no major loops, scaffold remnants, or figurative tangles that damage the climax or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, with varied rhythms and a few strong images (“chandelier of green,” “lies curdled in the air”). Exposition about the eye and textbooks repeats slightly but doesn’t significantly drag momentum; most lines carry more than one job (worldbuilding plus mood or character). There is little in the way of overwriting or muddled metaphor, and the ending image is clear. The prose is solid and publishable, though it could carry a bit more pressure and precision at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, images are mostly apt, and there’s little redundant scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent; a few metaphors (“brine and old iron,” “mist that clung like cobwebs”) are particularly effective. There’s mild purple-leaning diction but it does not obscure sense or momentum, and the prose carries both mood and information efficiently. With slightly sharper cutting of the more explicit thematic lines, this would be comfortably publication-ready on a sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and largely economical; most sentences do double duty for mood and information, and the narrative moves steadily from scene to scene without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, though a few metaphors (“blooming cavern at midsummer,” “cathedral-like chamber,” “frozen tears”) lean on familiar imagery. There are no syntax confusions, and paragraphing is well paced. A slightly sharper line edit could trim a few redundant qualifiers and elevate the voice from strong to truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with good variation in sentence length and strong verbs anchoring most images. A few formulations verge on purple (“lacy menace,” “cobalt grotto above clouds stretching like a bruise”) but remain legible and thematically aligned. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; almost every sentence adds either mood, motion, or interior shift. Tightening a handful of abstract or thematically declarative lines could further sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense, often doing double duty by advancing setting, character, and theme in the same sentence (e.g., the opening image of the nexus as a living heart). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and apt, creating a cohesive aesthetic rather than purple clutter. There are no real scaffold loops or syntactic templates; momentum is maintained throughout. A few abstractions (“density of presence,” “palette of resolve” as explained) flirt with jargon, but context keeps them legible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, clean syntax, and high information density with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and legible, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright purple incoherence. A few phrases edge toward familiar or slightly overdone (“clawed at my ribs,” “jealousy coiled in my gut”), but they don’t materially dull the closure image. Momentum holds throughout, with prose supporting rather than smothering the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and generally economical: most sentences do double duty with setting and interiority. Metaphors (fog as occlusion, gears and screws as tension) are coherent and sustained rather than piled on indiscriminately. There are minor lapses into slightly purple or redundant phrasing, but they do not appreciably slow momentum or blur meaning, and the final image lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“mist that pooled like spilled milk,” “trail like liquid starlight”) doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and theme—without obvious padding. Sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum, and there are no notable loops or syntactic artifacts. A few lines in the final third lean toward explanatory abstraction (“space where fear and courage collided,” “lies that cage the heart”), which slightly blunt the otherwise precise imagery. Overall, line-level craft meets a high publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and purposeful, with metaphors that are vivid but generally controlled (“dust smelled of regret,” “eyes two bruises”). Information density is high; most lines do double duty for character and atmosphere without padding or redundancy. There is a touch of stylistic lushness, but it rarely tips into purple or muddled imagery. The closure beat is clear and uncluttered, with the empty bottle and chainsaws landing cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluent, with few if any grammatical distractions and a solid sense of cadence. Some phrasing is memorably odd in a good way, but there is mild redundancy (“resounding hush” appears multiple times with similar effect; some ideas are restated). Metaphors are consistent and not over-stacked, though the prose approaches purple in places. Overall, polished but not razor-honed—there’s room to tighten without losing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished and economical: most sentences carry more than one function (image, mood, character) and avoid obvious redundancy. Figurative language is generally apt and fresh (“weight of silence,” “water so calm it mirrored the moon like a second sky”), with only light flirtation with purple without tipping over. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum through the count-down, tightening toward the reveal. A touch more restraint in explicit philosophizing would further sharpen the impact, but the craft is already at a high, publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid images (“shimmering, semi-transparent field… flickered like a heartbeat”) and good information density. A few metaphors and abstractions (“smooth as mycelium threading through soil,” “lattice of fear and resistance,” “quiet wildfire of change”) verge on purple but do not obscure sense. There is minimal redundancy and sentences typically perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, and motion). Overall momentum is maintained, though occasional thematic phrasing could be sharpened into more concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory density and metaphors that largely feel precise and apt (e.g., “its high windows streaked with silver,” “the walls pulsed like a heartbeat”). Sentences vary in length and structure, supporting momentum rather than bogging it down, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to become purple or confusing. Final images are clean and uncluttered, allowing the emotional beat to land.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density—most sentences pull double duty in atmosphere and characterization. Figurative language (“wind through a shattered window,” “melodically haunted souls”) is generally apt and coherent, and there’s little in the way of redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases flirt with abstraction (“melodically haunted souls”) but remain anchored enough in concrete context not to blur sense. Momentum never drags despite the reflective tone, and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density and vivid, often beautiful phrasing; most sentences do at least two jobs (image plus character, or world plus theme). Rhythm is varied, and there are few if any redundant scaffolding lines. The main risk is occasional drift toward purple or over-articulation of abstractions (“steep the past into the present,” “payment in memory, in the weight of small moments”), which slightly blurs momentum in a piece already low on external pressure. Still, clarity is never lost, and the final images are clean and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, details often do double duty (atmosphere + theme), and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent (“ivy that pulsed like a second heartbeat,” “danced like dervishes”), but it largely holds together and doesn’t obscure sense or causality. A few images edge toward density-for-its-own-sake, yet the prose remains legible and propulsive through the climax. No significant grammatical or clarity issues appear, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, and most carry multiple loads (world, character, mood) without padding. Some formulations lean toward the declarative/abstract (“His work was to map the unmapped, but his true purpose was deeper”) and a few images verge on familiar lyricism, but they don’t significantly bog momentum. Figurative language is generally clear and well-controlled, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. The prose is polished and publication-ready, if slightly more polished than surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid images, efficient sentences that pull multiple weights, and varied rhythm keep momentum. Metaphors are mostly clear and apt (“web,” “seeds,” “prismatic shards”), with only light repetition around the web metaphor. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose rarely lapses into purple or clotted abstraction. Some thematic statements could be compressed or implied, but they don’t significantly blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled and mostly free of scaffolding or synonym loops; nearly every sentence either advances image, mood, or character. Figurative language (“liquid silver,” “symphony of stillness,” “joyful sorrow”) is consistent in register and rarely over-stacked, avoiding purple excess. Rhythm varies well between longer, flowing description and shorter, declarative beats at turns, giving the piece good read-aloud musicality. Minor redundancies around the silence/music metaphor exist but don’t materially drag momentum or blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often striking, with strong information density: descriptions usually do double duty for atmosphere and character (e.g., inks made from “obsidian and nightshade” signal both world and psyche). Sentence rhythm and paragraphing maintain good momentum for a lyric piece, and there’s little scaffolding or obvious repetition. Some turns of phrase flirt with purple or summary (“Her motivation was not vandalism but rescue: a forgotten promise...”), pulling slightly away from scene into thesis. Tightening those expository lines and letting concrete images carry more of the load would sharpen an already high level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images like “the hush of the universe inhaling” and the color-coded lagoon; sentences usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion). There is some tendency toward abstraction and phrase reuse around sorrow/hope, but not enough to stall momentum or muddy key beats. Figuration remains mostly coherent and purposeful, with no serious metaphor tangles or redundancy loops. A bit of purpleness and thesis-like lines at the end keep it below the very highest band, especially for a “prestige” bar.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences are clear, varied, and purposeful, with strong concrete verbs and economical description. Images like the coin “burned in his palm” and the air tasting of ozone carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without excess. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the prose rarely spins its wheels. It’s strong, workmanlike literary prose with moments of flair, though not yet at the extraordinary compression and rhythmic distinctiveness of elite pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is strong and polished: sentences are varied, sensory details are specific, and many lines do double duty for mood and character. There is some repetition and mild purple edging (“bruised sky like a bruise on glass,” explicit recaps of already-implied concepts), but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or drag momentum in such a quiet piece. Information density is good, with few true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Overall, the line-level craft is publication-ready with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are coherent, and most do double duty in building both mood and character. Metaphors (“forests of second thoughts,” “where the hush where past meets prophecy lingered like a breath held too long”) are vivid and thematically apt, with minimal purple excess. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition, and transitions between description, interiority, and dialogue are smooth. The prose is slightly ornate but remains controlled and clear even in peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, largely free of redundancy and grammatical error, with good information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or movement. Imagery is mostly sharp and concrete, especially in the seascape, and the story reads smoothly aloud. There are a few abstractions and slightly purple turns (“combative tenderness,” “cruel and beautiful teacher,” repeated invocations of “freedom” and “true nature”) that verge on generic uplift rather than precision. These soft spots keep the line-level work from feeling fully honed for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled and evocative, with images like “wooden planks weathered to the color of old bone” and petals “scattering like ash” doing layered work. There’s good syntactic variety and little dead scaffolding; most sentences advance mood, world, or character. A few lines verge on explanatory or purple, especially where metaphors are spelled out (“Smoothness is a lie, of course”), but they don’t significantly blunt momentum. No major loops or artifacts appear, and the final cadence is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, precise word choice, and multi-tasking images that carry both atmosphere and meaning (e.g., “ice crystals…like suspended breath”). The repeated metaphoric density occasionally verges on purple, with some near-redundant restatements of silence/shimmer/boundaries that don’t always add new pressure. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, and the final images (glowing dust, liquid glass, threshold colonnade) are clean and memorable. Trimming a few overlapping phrases would sharpen the already-effective cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, imagery is mostly precise, and almost every line does double duty (worldbuilding plus character or theme). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; motifs of glass, fire, plants, and color are controlled and interwoven. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or filler transitions; momentum holds from first to last sentence. It stops short of exceptional only because some formulations (“glittered like starlight,” “laughed—a sound like shattering glass”) touch familiar territory rather than wholly singular phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures and strong imagery that usually pulls double duty for worldbuilding and theme. There are mild repetitions and a few near-slogans (“powerfully gentle,” “texture of connection”) that feel slightly programmatic, and occasionally the figurative density verges on purple without adding pressure. Still, clarity is maintained; cause and effect are easy to follow, and nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or idea. The final paragraphs in particular balance image and exposition reasonably well, even if the thematic statement could be leaner.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, dense yet controlled imagery, and efficient embedding of worldbuilding into evocative lines (“time pooled like mercury”). Repeated motifs (curtains, light, cranes) are purposeful rather than filler. There is a mild tendency toward ornate phrasing and explicit thematizing that slightly slows momentum, but it does not obscure meaning or closure. No obvious loops or mixed metaphors significantly harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with vivid yet controlled figurative language (“onyx-inked,” “tape, coiled beside her like a silver serpent,” “dawn bled through the glass”) and good information density. Most sentences do at least two jobs, advancing atmosphere and concept simultaneously, and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym-churn. At times the imagery flirts with purple, but it rarely over-stacks or tangles metaphors, and clarity is preserved through the end. Line-level craft is comfortably at or near elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences have varied rhythm, the imagery is vivid, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion plus theme). Phrases like “steadily unpredictable nature of truth” and “anguished joy of the unknown” flirt with abstraction and mild purple prose, but they remain legible and largely supported by concrete images around them. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or template cadences, and grammar/usage are clean. The density of metaphor is high but not so stacked or mixed as to muddy sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with vivid but not overcrowded imagery (“robes woven from spider silk and starlight,” “spines glowing faintly as the sun dipped”). Sentences vary in length and structure, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. A few lines edge toward the ornamental (“His voice was luminous with regret”) but they remain clear and tonally appropriate. No artifacts or figurative muddles significantly impede momentum or clarity, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, specific nouns, and metaphors that mostly cohere and reinforce one another (mist, shedding, glass, layers, maps). Information density is high; most sentences carry more than one function (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. At times the prose approaches purple, with fragility/softness/layers reiterated in similar terms, but this doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, interiority, and motion together), rhythm varies, and there’s little outright scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent (e.g., coffee rings as portals, “roots tapping Morse code”), though certain phrases edge toward purple or slogan-like without additional grounding. Momentum holds through the tunnel sequence without getting bogged down in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and generally economical, with specific nouns and verbs doing the work. Figurative language is present but not so dense that it muddies sense, and most images (lattice of memories, incubation, theater of light) cohere. There are a few slightly abstract or on-the-nose phrases (“unused love,” “unresolved grief”) that risk flattening nuance, but they don’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony impede the read.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight for lyric fantasy, with high information density—many sentences carry setting, emotion, and theme at once. Metaphors are mostly clean and legible (“eyes like fractured galaxies,” “breath of imprisoned gods”), and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. At times, imagery stacks (“murmur of a thousand voices, unspoken yet urgent”) verge on purple, but do not obscure sense or closure. Line-level craft is strong but could benefit from an occasional plainer sentence to sharpen contrast and heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are concise yet dense, most doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) without evident scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur sense; images tend to be concrete and internally coherent. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final cadence (“The fractured lullaby had found its rhythm”) crisply reweights earlier phrasing. A few metaphors tilt toward the familiar, but they don’t materially harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without obvious padding, and figurative language is vivid yet mostly coherent with the mechanical-organic motif. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding lines; information density is high for the length. A couple of phrases flirt with purple (“probability bent like willow branches”) but stay thematically aligned and don’t blur sense. The prose sustains momentum and clarity through the conceptual turn at the forest-brain reveal and into the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, often doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and the metaphors are mostly fresh and internally consistent. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or clutter; compression is good, and information density is high for the length. The prose occasionally leans toward the ornamental—many metaphors in a relatively calm scene—but it remains clear and doesn’t obscure causality or closure. The final image of dawn bleeding into the sky with the abandoned punch is especially clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and fluent, with strong images (“walls glimmered like frozen mercury,” “cloth so soft it seemed woven from moonlight”) and clean syntax and mechanics. There is a high density of figurative language, some of which drifts toward purple and conceptual (“staircase…wound upward like a question mark,” “safety…was not a cage but a garden”) rather than sharpening concrete stakes. A few summary sentences repeat already-implied ideas, slightly softening momentum, but there are no serious loops or clarity issues. Despite some overstatement at thematic beats, line-level craft is solid and publication-ready with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with varied sentence rhythms and efficient transitions between beats. Some metaphors and phrases feel somewhat stock (“her steps echoing like a heartbeat,” “burned like a star trapped in her chest”), but they don’t materially obscure sense or slow momentum. Information density is decent: sentences usually do atmospheric and narrative work simultaneously. There’s little visible scaffolding or synonym churn, and syntax remains lucid even during the climactic unmasking.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich, and rhythmically varied, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“a mosaic of grief,” “silence became a kind of currency”). Repetition of motifs (tapping, maps, light) feels intentional rather than scaffolding, and there are few if any genuine loops or filler sentences. Some phrases verge on abstraction or mild purple (“periodically eternal dark”; the explanatory paragraph about a “force that rewrote reality”) but do not obscure sense. Line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier venues, though a further pass could trim a bit of overt explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and musical, with strong, specific images and a good balance between lyricism and clarity (“the sky bled from amber to violet,” “a low, thunderous serenity that shook dust from the rafters”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do more than one job (advancing setting, mood, and character at once). Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple or muddled, and there are no noticeable scaffolding loops or syntactic tics. Minor moments of on-the-nose phrasing aside, line-level craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and generally economical: metaphors like “steamed like a cauldron left on the stove” or “blooming in her thoughts like a night-blooming cereus” feel deliberate rather than piled on. Sentences vary in length and cadence, supporting both atmosphere and momentum; there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few lines edge toward purple or expository stating of theme, especially in the final third, but they don’t materially obscure action or closure. With slightly more restraint in the ending rhetoric, this could nudge higher.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: imagery is clear, sensory, and not over-stacked; there’s little redundancy, and each paragraph advances character or atmosphere. Phrases like “pearl of stillness,” “salt-bleached roses,” and “crumbling mossy walls” are vivid without sliding into purple. Some expressions (“the world shattered,” the explicit therapy vocabulary) are more familiar or clinical than necessary, but they don’t significantly blunt the closure beat. There are no noticeable loops, grammatical slips, or figurative muddles that impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid verbs, layered images (“lamplight…flickering like a tired heartbeat,” “cards scattered like shattered mirrors”), and efficient integration of description with interior shifts. There is some drift toward purple/piled imagery and repetition of similar metaphoric registers (fragments, mirrors, webs) that could be trimmed for greater punch. Still, clarity is never truly compromised, and most sentences do more than one job (setting + theme + character). A slightly tighter, more varied cadence in peak beats would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is clean and rhythmic, with vivid but not overstacked imagery; most sentences perform multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) efficiently. There are very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases, and syntax varies enough to keep the read lively. Figurative language is more frequent in the opening but rarely tips into muddle or cliché. A slightly high density of modifiers in places is the only noticeable drag, and it doesn’t impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level writing is polished and readable, with few if any grammatical slips and a generally good sense of cadence. Some metaphors are evocative, but others lean toward purple or generic (“bravely conflicted heart,” “layers of snow and silence”), and there is noticeable repetition of key abstract terms without added nuance. A number of sentences paraphrase previous ones in slightly different language, adding mild redundancy and diluting momentum. The prose is solidly above average but would benefit from cutting clichés and sharpening images to earn its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are generally precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, characterization, theme) without obvious scaffolding. A few constructions verge on purple or redundant in abstraction (“mosaic of shattered rhythms,” “senselessly perceptive”), but they do not significantly obscure sense or slow momentum. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and patterned around sand, glass, and growth. There are no major syntactic artifacts, tense slips, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, generally tight syntax, and high information density with most lines doing double duty (world-building plus mood or character). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with only occasional edges of purple without harming clarity. There are no evident scaffold loops or synonym churn; progression feels smooth and purposeful. The prose is very good and occasionally beautiful, though it stops just short of the razor-sharp compression and surprise that would push it into the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level prose is generally clean, with varied sentence rhythm and solid information density; most sentences do double duty in character and atmosphere. Imagery like “gears grinding like a celestial heartbeat” and the repeated orbital language is evocative, if occasionally bordering on purple when stacked with “black hole,” “sunlight,” and “compass” metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and action and interiority are clearly sequenced. Slight over-reliance on thematic metaphor and aphoristic closure keeps this just below top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with vivid images like “machines that crackled with haunted firmware” and the amber’s “honeyed glow.” Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; it seldom tips into muddle or redundancy. A few lines lean toward explanatory scaffolding (e.g., explicit statements of the scientists’ intent) rather than dramatized implication, slightly flattening momentum. Overall sentence variety and clarity are strong, and the final image resolves cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled: vivid metaphors, tight syntax, and minimal redundancy; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). The figurative language is dense but generally coherent and thematically aligned (patterns, sound, light), avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. There are no noticeable scaffold phrases or synonym loops, and the closing image is clear. A few abstractions (“collective truth,” “new truths to emerge”) slightly thin the texture but don’t materially harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: high information density, vivid figurative language, and good rhythmic variation. A few lines veer toward abstract assertion or mild redundancy (“warm coldness” appears more than once; some transformation language is paraphrased rather than newly dramatized), but they don’t significantly harm clarity or momentum. Overall, the line-level work would be competitive in many venues with only light tightening of the most declarative sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and action, the metaphors are thematically consonant, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled; while it occasionally edges toward purple, it stays coherent and pattern-consistent with the piece’s lyric ambitions. Syntax is varied, transitions are clear, and the closure image (blank coin, golden light, distant applause) is cleanly delivered. A bit more restraint in piling abstract nouns (“regret,” “possibility,” “despair”) onto already-rich images would sharpen impact for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, densely informative, and generally avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors like “willowglass hope” and “fractally precise facets” are vivid and internally coherent, and figurative language doesn’t swamp clarity. Expository phrases are tight enough that momentum is maintained through technical and emotional beats alike. A few lines verge on conceptual heft, but they remain legible and do not blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, well-paced, and often do double duty for atmosphere and character, with few redundancies or scaffolding artifacts. Images like the heat-mapper’s color gradients and the golden spores storm are vivid without becoming incoherent. There is a mild tendency toward abstraction or slightly awkward coinages (“factually mystical aura”) and a few stock emotional tags, which keep it just shy of exceptional lyric control. Momentum holds smoothly from start to finish without bogging in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and generally pull double duty in advancing both atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to become purple; phrases like “unearthed silence” and “spin a prophecy into raw possibility” feel intentional rather than ornamental. There’s minor conceptual redundancy around “quiet inspiration” and the thematic summing-up, but not enough to significantly drag momentum. With a slight trim of abstractions in the final third, this would be fully competitive.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean yet evocative, doing multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) without heavy redundancy, and the rhythm supports the contemplative mood. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and legible (“mist clinging…like a second skin,” “voice fraying at the edges”), just shy of purple; it rarely muddies sense or momentum. There are no major scaffold loops or syntactic templates, and grammar and sequencing are clean. A bit more restraint in explicitly interpretive lines could heighten impact, but the prose is already publishable-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with few if any syntactic or grammatical slips; many lines do double duty for mood and characterization. There is mild repetition of concepts and phrasing (“distill complexity into essence,” the needle’s purpose) and occasional abstraction that could be tightened. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense that it muddies sense. Momentum is steady if low-tension, with limited scaffold or padding.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: vivid imagery, generally clean syntax, and efficient scene progression without obvious scaffolding or loops. The “phototropic to kindness/hope” motif, the hum of the lantern, and sun/ash contrasts are well handled and do multiple jobs. There is some tendency toward purple abstraction and neat aphoristic closers, which can feel slightly on-the-nose. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and figurative language rarely muddies sense.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are largely clean, musical, and efficient, with strong verbs and concrete images (e.g., the gauge’s “notches like tiny stars,” waves “whispering secrets”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and well-chosen; the occasional phrase (“protected vulnerability hanging in the air like mist”) edges toward purple yet doesn’t obscure meaning. There’s little scaffolding or repetition and the prose maintains momentum despite its reflective tone. With slight trimming of overtly decorative lines, it would readily meet elite standards.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly efficient, rhythm varies, and images tend to do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some purple edging (stacked metaphors and high-concept phrases) but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum, as the story is inherently contemplative. Scaffolding and repetition are minimal, and key beats are shown rather than summarized. Slight trimming of explanatory lines and a sharper contrast between plain and ornate textures would push this into elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and pull double duty in advancing scene and atmosphere. Figurative language (“prismatic quiet,” “liquid light,” “petal-strewn crown”) is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure sense. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and grammar and mechanics are clean. A touch of purple edging toward sentimental in places slightly softens impact but doesn’t damage clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level writing is clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied; sentences generally do multiple jobs (world, mood, and motion) without bloat. Occasional phrases are generic (“older than time, their minds unfathomable”) but they don’t significantly dull the core images. There’s little scaffold or paraphrase looping, and the action is easy to follow. The prose is polished enough for competitive venues, though trimming a few familiar metaphors would sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and purposeful, and the paragraphs move the scene forward without obvious scaffolding. There is some tendency toward purple phrasing and repetition of abstract intensifiers (“vital key,” “lost to time,” “transfixing force,” “rebellion”), but it doesn’t seriously obscure meaning or slow momentum. Information density is good; most lines carry atmosphere and plot together. The closing image is clear if a bit on-the-nose in its articulation of emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in rhythm, metaphors are mostly apt, and description often carries emotional and thematic weight while advancing scene. Phrases like “the lantern’s light carving their shadows into the quarry’s face” are vivid without tipping into full purple prose. There are occasional abstract or slightly stock formulations (“her methodical nature demanded answers,” “numbness that had settled over the case”), but not in clotted runs. Momentum stays intact, and there is little obvious scaffolding or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, with figurative language used judiciously and in support of mood. There’s little scaffold or repetition, and the prose maintains momentum even through expository beats like archival research. Images such as the “spongey gray” sky and instruments as “anxious sentinels” are fresh without tipping into purple. A couple of adjective clusters could be trimmed, but they don’t materially impede clarity or pace.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight, with vivid images (“scent…clung to the air like a memory,” “ground beneath his feet felt like memory”) that do multiple jobs at once. There are a few light repetitions in concept (pixels/patterns described similarly) and a tendency toward stacked similes, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur sense. Syntax varies well, and action remains clear even as reality bends. The closing paragraphs in particular balance clarity and lyricism without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and readable, with some nicely turned phrases (“dusky harmony,” “forgotten dreams”). Sentences usually carry more than one function (atmosphere + character interiority) and avoid obvious scaffolding or loops. There is some reliance on familiar constructions and thematic explanation rather than vivid, pressured scene work, which slightly dulls momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is solid and publishable, though not exceptionally sharp or compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and legible (“light pooling in the prism like melted silver,” “a tide finding its shore”), without mixed metaphors or heavy loops. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose maintains momentum through description rather than stalling in it. A few thematic assertions verge on purple but don’t materially blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is fluent and largely well-paced, balancing description with forward movement; most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or plot). Figurative language is somewhat frequent but usually coherent and not so dense as to become purple or muddy. There are minor repetitions of phrasing and a few familiar images, yet no significant scaffold, synonym churn, or line-level confusion that blurs cause and effect. Rhythm and paragraphing support the arc into and out of the vortex effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: metaphors are mostly apt, cadence is varied, and sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and character. The figurative density is high but largely coherent; images like “time pooled like spilled ink” and “sky had been sutured shut” feel precise rather than showy. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and information flows clearly through the scene. A few explanatory phrases could be tightened, yet they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, generally precise diction, and images that pull double duty for mood and theme (“thread was spun from spider silk and moonlight”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not self-contradictory; it sustains the chosen register. There is some mild repetition of key phrases (“trammel your regret,” “inlay meaning everywhere”) that reads as motif rather than scaffolding. Momentum is maintained throughout; no obvious redundant paragraphs or confusing syntax undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong information density and vivid yet controlled figurative language (“mildew and regret,” “a chasm of granite,” “a song half-remembered”). Sentences vary rhythmically, and most lines pull double duty for character and atmosphere rather than serving as scaffolding. There are a few familiar constructions and slightly on-the-nose phrases, but no real loops, synonym churn, or overwrought metaphor clusters that bog momentum. The closing lines land cleanly and musically without explanatory padding.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: clear sentences, vivid images (“iron roots coiled through the stratosphere,” “tendril of light… twisting like a vine”), and economical paragraphing. Most lines do double duty, advancing atmosphere and idea simultaneously. There is some repetition of conceptual language (“transition,” “knowledge,” “analogical thinking”) and mild purple tendencies that could be trimmed for tautness. Still, momentum holds and the closure image is not dulled by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are rich yet generally clear, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). A few phrases flirt with purple or redundancy, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or obscure sense. The rhythm from long, lush description into short declaratives (“Fear is a tide,” the librarian said. “It recedes.”) is particularly effective. The prose could be trimmed slightly in places for even greater sharpness, but it already reads as polished.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and often carry multiple jobs (image, world-building, and theme at once). The figurative language is mostly apt and controlled, with recurring motifs (light that isn’t light, hum, radiance) reinforcing the conceit rather than cluttering it. There is some mild abstraction and repetition in the final third (“connection,” “hope,” “dissolve the walls”) that could be sharpened into fresher concrete images. No major loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts interfere with clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery (“ivy…like a thousand green fingers,” “map the labyrinth of her regrets”) is vivid without becoming incoherent or overstacked, and there’s little redundancy. A few abstractions (“stagnant pool,” “terrain of self-forgiveness”) drift toward familiar metaphor, but they don’t significantly bog momentum or blur the closure. Pacing remains smooth throughout, and the final image of “Begin” lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and carries a good balance of image and motion; sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and character. A few phrases recur (“library’s glow,” “unspoken words”) but not to loop-like excess, and the metaphors stay coherent. Line-level work is publication-ready with only light tightening needed for maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images pull double duty for atmosphere and theme. Recurrent motifs (stain, ice, plants, velvet) are worked without obvious redundancy, and the closing cadences land cleanly. There is some density of figurative language that edges toward purple in spots (“mulberry ache,” “perforated destiny, holes in its fate where choices bled into chaos”), but it rarely muddies sense or momentum. Trimming a few metaphor stacks would heighten impact without altering meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences advance setting, mood, and stakes simultaneously. Some metaphor and modifier stacking (“mirror to the cosmos,” “latent magic,” “radiant hush”) edges toward purple, but the images remain coherent and legible. Rhythm varies well, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; the line-level work sustains momentum instead of bogging it. A bit more spareness at peak pressure might sharpen intensity, but craft is clearly above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence structure, mostly tight phrasing, and images that generally pull their weight. The “vineyard hush” and “scalloping their edges” images are distinctive and support mood rather than merely decorating. There’s some repetition of thematic language (cycle of rebirth, contentment) and a mild tendency toward aphoristic lines near the end, but no serious scaffolding or synonym loops. Momentum remains steady, with little fat at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and often do double-duty for image and meaning (“a tattered garment woven from years of second-guessing and half-truths”). Figurative language is mostly controlled and aligned with the story’s metaphoric system (doubt, filters, chimes). There is minor conceptual redundancy and a few near-platitudinous lines, but no serious loops or purple overload. Rhythm and clarity are both well-handled, comfortably publishable with light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, clean mechanics, and high information density in many lines (e.g., the magnetic grotto description). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme, creating a unified texture rather than a muddle. There is a mild tendency toward purple repetition of certain motifs (starlight, patterns, weaving truth) that risks redundancy but doesn’t significantly impede clarity or momentum. The final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level writing is generally clean, with strong images (“towers of bone…against a bruised sky,” “voices…a chorus”) and a controlled rhythm suitable to contemplative fantasy. There is some mild redundancy and abstraction (“his resolve, weathered by years of study and failure, hardened”) that could be trimmed without loss. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple or confusing, and syntax remains clear. The final paragraphs slide toward summary and thematic exposition instead of fully dramatized beats, softening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and largely efficient; most carry at least two functions (worldbuilding plus emotion, or action plus theme). Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts that stall momentum. A few phrases repeat (“lingering luminance,” “sacred in the simple”) and some modifiers could be trimmed, but clarity and rhythm hold throughout. The prose is well above functional, though it stops short of line-level brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and metaphors are vivid yet legible (“their spines warped into grotesque smiles,” “latched onto his ribs like a second heartbeat”). The piece skirts purple at moments—stacked figurative language and concept-phrases in close succession—but rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and momentum is maintained throughout. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with no noticeable loops or scaffolding that would require tightening for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Figurative density is high but largely coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or serious purple excess. There is some conceptual redundancy (re-explaining what alignment means, reiterating static/signal) that slightly slows momentum, and a few abstract turns could be compressed. Still, clarity and propulsion remain strong, and the closure image is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for mood and information, with very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“as if carved by fear itself,” “the tide that drowns the unspoken”) is vivid and controlled rather than piled. Rhythm varies cleanly, and action order remains easy to follow even as the ritual intensifies. A few abstract or explanatory sentences near the end slightly blunt the otherwise excellent density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is generally tight: strong verbs, concrete images, and minimal scaffolding keep momentum while conveying a lot of information. Metaphors like the viaduct as “a bridge of frozen light” and the bell as a “brittle shell” are clear and apt, and figurative language isn’t overstacked. There’s some repetition of key adjectives (“brittle,” “earnestly naive”) and a few mildly expository sentences, but no pervasive loops or purple patches. The prose comfortably meets a publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: vivid, economical images (e.g., “foundations like broken teeth”), clean syntax, and a good balance of description and movement keep momentum. Most sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. The diction occasionally edges toward the ornate, but not enough to blur sense or clog pacing. Grammar and mechanics are clean, and the final sentence neatly recharges prior motifs without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythms, precise imagery, and multi-function sentences that advance setting, character, and theme at once. Phrases like “liquid stained glass” or “trapped starlight” are vivid without being confusing, and action remains clear even in more figurative moments. There is a mild tendency toward lushness and abstraction (“beauty of paradox,” “flame of reason ignite the ember of instinct”) that could be pruned for even greater impact. Nonetheless, momentum holds and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, mostly compact, and each tends to carry more than one function (worldbuilding plus emotional or thematic shading). Figurative language is present but not smothering, and there are few outright redundancies or scaffolding lines. A handful of phrases feel familiar or mildly purple, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure cause and effect. The final paragraphs land cleanly, with a crisp, readable cadence and a solid closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and generally efficient, with some strong images (the sky as “a swirling vortex of gold and crimson,” history rewriting itself). At the same time, several metaphors and phrases feel familiar or slightly clichéd (“like sugar in tea,” “smooth as oil,” “like a dormant volcano”), which blunts the line-level freshness. There is no serious looping or scaffolding, and information density is decent for the length. A bit more rigor in pruning stock expressions and sharpening figurative language would be needed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with good rhythm and a mix of sentence lengths; details often do double duty for atmosphere and character. Phrases like “storm-born silence” and “mind remained a labyrinth of curiosity” flirt with purple but largely stay coherent and on-theme. There’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition, and clarity is never in doubt. The style is strong and publishable, though it doesn’t consistently surprise at the clause level.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and image-rich, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and story. Repetition around concepts like “macerated air” and “lost laughter” is noticeable but patterned enough to read as motif rather than scaffolding. Some phrasing edges toward purple, yet it rarely obscures sense or momentum, and the climax is clearly visualized. Tightening a few redundant constructions and slightly mixed metaphors would sharpen the line-level craft further.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is controlled and often striking (“tattered cloak that shed mist like a snakeskin,” “interiorizing exteriors”) with good sentence variety and high information density. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and legible, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. At times the diction veers near purple, and a couple of conceptual phrases feel more clever than embodied, but clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with few mixed metaphors; the repetition of “The penny dropped” feels slightly mechanical but not ruinous. There are minimal loops or padding, and the action remains clear even in the climax, with line-level craft supporting momentum rather than bogging it down. A light pare-back of explicit thematic statements and one or two slightly ornate phrases would sharpen the already strong line work.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images and a good sense of cadence, and most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and action). There is some density of figurative language—“serenely electric static,” “spectral fingers,” “shard of hush”—that occasionally feels ornamental rather than strictly necessary. The closing paragraphs slip into abstract summarizing of insight, which lowers information density and momentum compared to the earlier, more image-driven lines. No major clarity issues appear, but a tighter line edit could prune repetition and soften the tendency toward overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, multi-functional, and rhythmically varied; there’s little outright redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and purposeful, and it rarely muddies the scene’s mechanics or emotional throughline. Occasional purple-ish choices (“light of a thousand suns,” “permanent transient moment”) edge toward overstatement but remain comprehensible. Overall, the prose is vivid and propulsive enough for publication with only minor trimming or de-intensifying of a few metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with some strong images (glass warping into “liquid fractals,” thread humming between mirrors) doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. There is some repetition and near-paraphrase (“unsettling, yet peaceful” / “Unsettling, yes. But calm, too.”) and a tendency to restate realizations instead of letting images stand. Figurative language stays coherent and doesn’t swamp clarity. Momentum holds well for the length, though a few lines of thematic explanation could be trimmed for even tighter impact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are clean, grammatical, and generally economical; information density is solid without obvious scaffolding or loops. There are some familiar phrases (“a sense of purpose settle over her,” “beauty of the unknown”) and modest repetition of key terms, but they don’t significantly blur clarity. Rhythm and paragraphing support a measured, meditative pace consistent with the piece’s aims. The line-level craft is competent and occasionally graceful, if a bit safe.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and varied, with many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and character. There is occasional purple or cliché-adjacent wording (“forgotten promises,” “the atrium seemed to exhale,” “weight of the moment settling in her chest”), but not in a way that obscures meaning or muddies key beats. Momentum is steady; there are no obvious paraphrase loops or structural scaffolds, and action order remains clear. Tightening a few sentimental or stock formulations would likely elevate the piece into a more distinct stylistic register.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is strong and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character while maintaining forward motion. Sensory images (rust, salt, skeletal seaweed, impossible dials) are concrete and not merely decorative. There are a few slightly writerly phrases and mild intensifier stacking, but they don’t obscure action or dull the closure image. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony undercut the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and evocative yet legible metaphors. Key motifs (ink, shard, static, heartbeat) are efficiently re-used rather than padded. There is some repetition of conceptual phrasing (“fetch wisdom from failure,” “digital ghost”) that nudges toward mild purple prose but does not significantly drag momentum or clarity. The final images (ink patterns glowing, shard clinking, snow) land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient: images like “a throat of endless echoes” and “a fault line in the earth’s memory” carry multiple layers of meaning without muddling clarity. Sentence rhythm varies well between longer lyric lines and more clipped, high-pressure moments, sustaining momentum. There’s minimal redundancy and few stock phrases, though a couple of similes (“like shattering glass,” “like ink spilled on parchment”) are more familiar and slightly undercut the otherwise distinctive language. Overall, line-level craft is polished and does not impede orientation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and metaphors that are vivid yet mostly controlled (oil-slick skin, laughter that makes glass shiver). There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase; nearly every line pushes atmosphere, character, or plot. A couple of phrases flirt with purple (“frostbitten hope curdling into resolve”) but they still land as emotionally precise rather than overwrought. No noticeable loops or structural artifacts slow momentum, especially through the metamorphosis and ending beats.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are vivid, metaphors are mostly clean and non-redundant, and each line advances mood, world, or stakes. There’s high information density without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops, and the prose adapts its rhythm to the moment (longer, lush early lines; tighter under pressure). A few metaphors cluster (“sap that smelled of honey and memory,” “fell like tears”) but they don’t blur meaning or momentum. The closing cadence is particularly well-tuned, returning to “resonantly soft” music with a fresh charge.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is controlled, and most lines do double duty in advancing mood and situation. Figurative language is rich but mostly coherent and thematically aligned, and there’s little in the way of obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. The prose pushes toward the purple in places (“twilight’s bruise,” “brittle hush thick enough to choke on”), but it remains legible and doesn’t obscure causality or closure. Tightening a few metaphor clusters and trimming a small handful of explanatory phrases would put this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and clean, with strong images like the train “crouched…like a broken toy” and horses in an “eternal, silent race.” Line-level clarity is high and there are few, if any, syntactic or grammatical distractions. There is some repetition of key phrases and a mild tendency toward purple phrasing, but it mostly serves the lyric mode rather than obscuring meaning. Information density and momentum are solid though not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level prose is confident and mostly economical, with concrete images like “pages rustling like whispers” and “the floor seemed to ripple” doing effective double duty for atmosphere and event. A few phrases lean generic or expository (“analog memories,” “state of being, accessible only through the lens of the impossible”) and occasionally explain what the images have already shown. Nonetheless, rhythm is varied, clarity is maintained, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language supports rather than obscures the core action.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density—most sentences do double duty as scene, mood, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and sensorially grounded, and there are few to no paraphrase loops or scaffolding artifacts. At times, the sheer metaphorical saturation edges toward purple, slightly blurring sharpness in high-pressure beats. Still, clarity at the climax and closure remains intact, and line-level craft is well above average for competitive venues.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with generally good rhythm and a reasonable information density. Some phrases verge on purple or abstract (“hush of cosmic possibility,” “improbable longing”) and a few ideas are restated in slightly different words, but not to a disruptive degree. Imagery is consistent and not muddled; figurative language is used but not stacked to the point of opacity. Minor redundancy and occasional generic abstractions keep it from the top tiers.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences are clear, varied in length, and do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without bloat. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and phrases like “crisp nostalgia” and “broken stars” feel thematically apt rather than decorative. There are a few mild repetitions and slightly on-the-nose formulations, yet no real loops or artifacts that drag momentum or cloud the climax. The prose is polished enough for serious consideration, though it stops just short of formally dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, sensuous, and purposeful, with images doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) and very little dead scaffolding. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most metaphors are coherent and apt; the “map of some forgotten realm” and “truth was too sharp” both serve character and world. There is mild density of figurative language but it does not tip into purple or obscure causality. No significant loops or mechanical artifacts slow momentum, especially given the story’s quiet, contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; most lines are doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or characterization plus motion). Figurative language is frequent but generally clean and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or metaphor stacks that obscure sense. There is little evident scaffolding or redundancy, and the final images land clearly. It’s lush, occasionally bordering on purple but not crossing into real muddle, so it reads as deliberate stylistic choice rather than lack of control.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, with good sentence variety and a solid balance between image and movement (“threads falling away like old skin,” “buzz of a thousand conversations”). Repetition around “hush,” “silence,” and “weight” functions mostly as motif rather than dead looping. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur sense, and there are no major mixed metaphors or syntactic stumbles. A few lines flirt with abstraction or mild sentimentality, but they do not materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, and most images (broken halos, ink-smudged borders, outstretched saintly hands) pull double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, without obvious mixed metaphors or redundancy loops. A few phrases verge on thematic redundancy (“silence interpreted…as language,” then re-explained philosophically), but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final image is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, with strong verb choices and concrete nouns (salt-crusted spine, reel-to-reel, 12-second loop of white noise) that efficiently build both world and mood. Sentences generally carry multiple functions—advancing plot while deepening theme or character—with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to feel purple, and the final paragraphs land clearly. Occasional near-platitudinous formulations (“a language for the quiet, analytic ache of holding on too tight”) slightly dilute the sharpness but do not materially harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and images that usually carry more than one layer of work (worldbuilding plus emotion). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, and there are few if any true loops or scaffolding sentences. At times, compounds like “driftingly alert” or repeated “between lightning and thunder” edges toward self-consciousness, slightly diluting impact. Nonetheless, momentum and clarity hold, and the closing image is clean and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences vary in length and rhythm, most images are clean, and there’s little waste—almost every line advances mood, setting, or character. Some metaphors verge on purple or familiar (e.g., “like a tired heart,” “wore grief like a second skin”), but they don’t significantly blur clarity or stall momentum. The repetition of flame/ice, light/glass is purposeful rather than looped scaffolding. Overall, the prose feels polished and readable, if not yet startlingly distinctive at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most images do double duty (worldbuilding and theme). Metaphoric language (“patina glowing like old coins,” “mourning veil,” “quiet explosion of memory”) is vivid and mostly coherent, without mixed or clashing vehicles. There’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; the prose keeps moving. A handful of phrases verge on purple or redundant in conceptual register, but they don’t materially obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight and vivid, with sentences often doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“fractually precise patterns in the grain, spirals that mirrored the constellations she’d never seen”). Rhythm varies, and description rarely stalls momentum. A few repeated constructions and slightly purple touches (“fractually precise” echoed, “heightened stillness” named twice) keep it from feeling utterly knife-sharp, but they don’t materially obscure clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “its copper hull creaking like a sigh” and “handwriting slanting like a storm front” are vivid without becoming opaque, and most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character). Rhythm is varied, with a good mix of long, flowing descriptive lines and shorter, pressured beats as tension rises. There’s a mild tendency toward lush metaphor density, but it rarely crosses into purple or repetitive, and clarity is preserved even in the portal sequence. I see little overt scaffolding or synonym churn; nearly every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and image-rich, with few if any syntactic or clarity issues. Most sentences do double-duty for mood and information, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping. There is a mild tendency toward purple/abstract phrasing in the closing thematic statements, but it doesn’t obscure meaning. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean, grammatical, and largely concise, with some evocative phrases (“floating rock arches drifted like ancient sentinels,” “brambled hope was palpable”). Most sentences do more than one job—advancing action while reinforcing tone or theme. There is mild overwriting and abstraction in places, especially where theme is restated, but not enough to drag momentum or obscure sense. Variation in sentence structure and paragraphing keeps the prose readable, if not strikingly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful, rarely slipping into mixed metaphors or purple prose. The final third maintains clarity under pressure, with the destruction of the pane and puppet rendered in clean, strong images. A slight reduction in direct restatement of thematic ideas and an even leaner handling of a few metaphors would sharpen the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is generally tight, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for mood and plot (“their gears spat sparks as they grazed the stones” both escalates danger and grounds the birds physically). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and not contradictory, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. The prose stays clear under pressure; action choreography at the fountain and with the birds converging is easy to follow. A few phrases lean close to purple, but they don’t measurably obscure sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong: rhythmic sentences, high information density, and recurrent motifs (foam, braiding, chrysalis) doing double duty as image and structure. Sensory and metaphorical language is mostly controlled, though there are moments of mild purple or repetition (“as the pieces fell into place” appears twice; some thematic lines paraphrase each other). The climactic insights are occasionally told in abstract terms rather than fully embodied, but clarity and momentum remain intact. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, just short of the most rarefied lyric precision.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and economical for its lyric density; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are mostly coherent and on-theme, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A few images lean toward the ornate, but they don’t obscure sense or muddy the closure image. Line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier consideration, just shy of the startling precision seen in the very top echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in structure, dense with information, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors (“sandpaper rough memories,” “structure itself were a confession”) are vivid and coherent with the world’s logic. Prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism; each sentence either advances action, deepens interiority, or sharpens atmosphere. There’s mild metaphor density, but it never tips into muddle or obscures cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally fluent and musical, with good syntactic variety and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is a recurring tendency toward purple or stacked metaphor (“pendulum of reconciliation,” “stories, like grain, must flow freely to nourish”) and some conceptual redundancy, particularly around bridges/silos and time as metaphor. Nonetheless, sentences remain clear, and the figurative language, while occasionally heavy-handed, is coherent and voice-consistent. Momentum holds across the piece without obvious scaffold sentences or confusing figurative muddle in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“silver light pooling… like liquid mercury,” “shards glinting like shattered constellations”) and good line-level clarity. Some metaphors are a bit dense and verge on purple, and certain phrases repeat (“chaotically precise,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams”) in ways that feel slightly self-conscious. Nevertheless, rhythm varies, sentences do multiple jobs at once, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The closure sentence is clear and charged, not muddied by figurative overload.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs, concrete images, and minimal scaffolding; most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or rules). Phrases like “clandestinely luminous” and “latent blaze” flirt with lushness but remain coherent within the established lyric register. I see no significant loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues, and paragraphing supports pacing from exploration to inversion to return. It’s strong, publication-ready craft that could be further elevated by a few sharper, more surprising turns of phrase in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory density and multi-function sentences that advance setting, mood, and character simultaneously. Metaphors are generally clean and aligned to the sound/wood/vibration domain, avoiding serious purple excess. There is minor redundancy in emphasizing the same beauty of the grove and Elara’s devotion, but not enough to drag momentum at this short length. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to keep the piece from falling into a mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and multi-functional: description often advances atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the nexus hum making his teeth ache). Sentence rhythms vary and avoid mechanical patterns, and there are few if any paraphrase loops. Some phrases tip toward abstraction or mild purple (“hopeful melancholy warming his chest,” “charged with the weight of forgotten oaths”), but they don’t obscure clarity or stall momentum. Information density is high for the length, and the final lines land with a clean, image-forward cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: grammar is clean, description is concrete when focused on the workshop, and sentences often do double duty for mood and character. There is some tendency toward repeated conceptual phrasing around silence/empathy and slight purple overreach, but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum. The reflective segments integrate smoothly without stalling the scene. A tighter pass could trim a few abstract restatements in the final third to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“her olfactorily sensitive nose detecting scents others missed”). Repetition of certain constructions and terms (“journalized,” “undercurrent of wisdom”) edges toward mannerism but doesn’t stall momentum. Figurative language is mostly controlled; a few phrases (“wrapping paper of her heart”) flirt with sentimentality yet remain intelligible. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final image resolves cleanly at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and imagistic, with strong verbs and minimal syntactic clutter. Some metaphor clusters (“liquid spheres that glowed faintly, as if echoing the planet’s hidden rhythms”) work well, but the closing paragraphs slide into more abstract phrasing and a few near-platitudes. There’s mild redundancy in explaining what the reader can infer (e.g., re-stating resilience and echoes thematically). Overall, the line-level craft is solid and publishable but not yet razor-sharp for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are clear, varied, and purposeful, and most carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, and character) without bloat. Occasional metaphors (“puzzle box,” “the machine was hungry”) are a touch familiar but not purple, and they don’t obscure action or causality. There’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym-churn, and rhythm supports momentum through the investigative sequence and climb. It reads as polished, if not stylistically daring.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and sensory-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “sculpted hush made flesh,” “silence pooled like indigo ink”). Rhythm varies effectively, and most sentences move the story forward in either image or emotional charge. There is some risk of over-saturation with figurative language and abstract nouns (“wonder,” “truth,” “inevitable”) that occasionally edge toward purple or repetitive, but they do not obscure sense or closure. Overall line-level control is strong and nearly publish-ready, just slightly over-ornamented in places.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, generally high information density, and images that often do double duty for atmosphere and theme. A few metaphors verge on purple or pile up (“avalanchingly quiet heart,” “time pooled like liquid,” “song now a quiet hum in his chest”), but they remain legible and largely coherent. There’s no noticeable synonym churn, scaffolding, or confusing syntax; each sentence moves character, mood, or plot. Slight tightening of the more ornamental phrases would bring it into truly elite line-level territory.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—many sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously (“burnt sapphire and iron filings,” “syntax looping like a Möbius strip”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and on-theme; it rarely tips into true purple or self-contradiction. Rhythm is varied and supports escalation, especially in the frantic middle section with the press and the ink. There are no obvious loops, scaffolds, or grammatical distractions dulling momentum or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length, metaphors are largely coherent (e.g., aurora as “spectral hand”), and there’s good information density. The prose avoids obvious loops or template cadences, and most sentences do multiple jobs (setting + mood + character). A few formulations flirt with mild purple (“colors coiling like tendrils”) but don’t obscure clarity or momentum. Overall, it reads polished and publishable with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally lean, vivid, and purposeful, with several strong images (“crystalline branches piercing the morning mist like frozen lightning”). Line-level clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and information density is good. There are a few familiar phrases and mild redundancies (“her voice trembling,” “sickening lurch,” slightly repetitive framing of the arbor’s hush) that hold it below top-tier polish. Figurative language is mostly controlled and not overstacked, but it doesn’t yet feel singular.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong: good rhythm, varied sentence structures, and a high density of meaningful images per line. Some metaphoric density verges on over-rich (“sunlight dripped through leaves like liquid gold,” “raveling silence,” “time’s tapestry thread by thread”), and a few phrases repeat conceptual ground, which slightly blunts momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is never lost, and the closure image of weaving silence is clean and memorable. Trimming a handful of ornate modifiers and overlapping metaphors would elevate the line-level to elite-literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with some strong images and minimal redundancy. There is a tendency toward stacked metaphors and elevated phrasing (“smelled of damp earth and forgotten dreams,” “bartered awakening,” “coax resilience from rubble”) that can feel a bit purple, but they remain coherent and don’t obscure sense. Momentum holds through the descent and trial, though the resolution paragraph compresses major change into summary-like statements rather than dramatized beats. Overall, information density is good and there are few, if any, obvious scaffolding or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is mostly tight: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without evident bloat, and rhythm shifts appropriately with action. Imagery such as “vortex of fractured light” and “time bled sideways” is vivid and legible, even if occasionally conventional for the genre. Redundancy and scaffold are minimal; the story moves efficiently from beat to beat. A couple of phrases verge on purple or awkward (“smiled, cyclically spontaneous”), but they are isolated rather than symptomatic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and carry multiple jobs (setting, interiority, tone) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Sensory specificity is generally high, and figurative language is restrained and coherent. Some phrasing leans into gentle abstraction or repetition (“a new kind of light glowed,” “ache of the dark remained”), but it doesn’t materially dull closure. The prose is nearly publication-ready with only minor tightening needed in a few reflective lines.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with good information density and minimal scaffolding; few sentences feel like pure throat-clearing. Some metaphors are stacked (“flame flickering like a captured comet,” “liquid night,” “restless gods”) but they mostly cohere tonally rather than muddling sense. There’s a touch of explanatory repetition around “total internal reflection” and the lantern mechanics that edges toward over-telling, yet it doesn’t seriously drag momentum. Overall the prose is polished and clear, just a hair lush in places without crossing into full purple.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and many lines do double-duty advancing both atmosphere and interiority. Some metaphors stack (“quietly explosive,” “stolen secret,” “tiny, angry star”), but they largely cohere and don’t cross into muddle. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding that drags momentum, especially given the lyric mode. The prose could be slightly pruned for tautness, yet it remains publishable-quality as is.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is largely clean: syntax varies, imagery is generally lucid, and there are few redundancies that stall momentum. Some metaphoric phrasing drifts toward the purple or generic (“quantified sorrow that pooled in the tower’s shadows,” “celestial heartbeat”) but does not seriously cloud meaning. The exposition about tower design and sorrow measurement verges on telling-yet-poetic, though it remains readable. With a tighter trim of familiar formulations and a bit more compression, this could reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, imagistic, and mostly well-controlled, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and world-building. Some metaphor clustering (“time pooled like mercury,” “shadows had their own language,” “bound release of hope”) edges into purple and there is mild repetition of abstractions like “hope,” “realm’s soul,” and “woven dawns.” Nonetheless, clarity remains high and there are few true scaffold or loop sentences. A slight pruning of sentimental or redundant phrases would lift the line-level to a more elite register.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, well-paced, and carry multiple functions (setting, mood, interiority) without obvious redundancy. Metaphors and abstractions (“enlarged tranquility,” “a secret too heavy to announce”) are mostly apt and not over-stacked. There are no major loops, syntactic monotony, or filter-verb build-ups that drag momentum. A few phrases edge toward the lyrical-generic, but they don’t significantly obscure or dilute key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, syntax varies, and description typically multitasks (advancing setting, mood, and theme at once). Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A handful of abstract phrasings (“tangible absolution,” “sacred in the ordinary”) lean generic compared to the sharper concrete images, slightly dulling peak beats. Overall, though, the prose is clean, rhythmic, and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and carries good information density—description often does double duty for atmosphere and character. There are occasional mild redundancies and slightly purple touches, but they don’t obscure sense or drag momentum. Sentences vary in length and structure, and the action is easy to follow. At an elite standard, this reads as solidly polished but not yet line-by-line electric.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, vivid, and information-dense, with metaphors that mostly feel apt (“voice like shattered glass,” “comforting unease of her father’s legacy”). There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances plot, character, or mood. The prose edges lush at times but avoids purple excess, and closure imagery is crisp. Minor tightening of a few descriptive clusters would further sharpen momentum without altering meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is strong: sensory density (especially taste) is purposeful, and images like “the aurora’s glow painted the ground in liquid light” feel precise rather than generic. Sentences vary in length and cadence, and nearly all lines do double duty for mood and exposition. There’s a slight flirtation with purple prose, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum, and there are no evident scaffolding loops. The final paragraphs land cleanly without figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and vivid, with a good sense of rhythm and generally efficient sentences that carry both image and interiority. There are occasional purple or slightly overwrought turns (“auroral sorrow,” “festered…like a wound,” “mnemonically gifted”) and some near-redundant abstractions around suppression and calling, but they don’t seriously obscure meaning. Figurative language remains mostly coherent and not excessively stacked, and action sequencing is clear. For an elite venue, tightening a few clichés and abstractions would be necessary, but the line-level craft is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, with vivid but mostly disciplined imagery. Phrases like “truth would pulse there like a heartbeat” and the quill’s physical reactions compress world-building and theme efficiently into concrete images. There is a mild tendency toward lush metaphor stacking in the opening (e.g., “toxic sky bled amber,” “ink… like poisoned honey”) that risks purple, but it settles as the story progresses. No noticeable scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony impede momentum, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, metaphors are generally coherent, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, atmosphere, and character). There is some purple tilt (“painted symphonies of truth,” “hues of amber and violet”) but it remains legible and rarely bogs momentum. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal, and the final image lands clearly. Slight overrichness in the thematic closing keeps it from the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with strong images like “bioluminescent threads that pulsed like a heartbeat” and “her joints creaking like old hinges” doing double duty for worldbuilding and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; it rarely muddies sense or stalls momentum. A few lines border on abstraction or repetition (e.g., repeated invocations of “chaos” and “static” as concepts rather than concrete experience), slightly diluting impact. Overall, information density is solid, and there are no major loops or artifacts blunting the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and occasionally vivid (“air smelled of damp earth and old paper,” “cobblestones gleamed under the first light”). Line-level rhythm is varied enough, and sentences generally do more than one job without obvious padding or loops. There are some familiar phrases (“her curiosity burned,” “felt like fate”) that soften the impact, but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum. Overall, craft is solid and publishable, if not stylistically daring.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, varied in syntax, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically relevant (spider/web, dance as code, silk as both fortress and whisper). Action sequences are easy to follow despite lyricism, and there are no obvious scaffold loops or clumsy redundancies. A slightly high saturation of metaphors in some passages keeps it from feeling utterly effortless, but it does not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with enough sensory specificity to avoid generic texture. Most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or setting plus theme), and there are no serious metaphor muddles or artifact loops. That said, some phrasing trends toward the conventional (“burned bright,” “flood of memories,” “place of mourning and mystery”), and pressure moments are not especially sharpened by rhythm or syntax shifts. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but lacks the compression and unexpected precision expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with strong images like “fireflies drifted like embers” and concrete sensory anchors. However, there is density of figurative language—“terrestrially cosmic,” “tranquil blaze,” “smoothed hush”—that can feel self-conscious and occasionally redundant (e.g., reiterating her solitary dedication and tranquil purpose). The prose remains clear, but the ornamentation sometimes dilutes impact rather than heightening it. Tightening metaphors and cutting repetition would sharpen momentum and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level writing is polished: concrete images, generally tight sentences, and no major redundancy or syntactic scaffolding. Metaphors like the engravings “shifting like liquid” and the building’s language being “sleeping” are apt and consistent with the piece’s logic. Information density is strong; most lines are doing double duty for mood and plot. It stops short of formally inventive or arrestingly original prose, but there are no significant artifacts dragging momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without padding, and the rhythm modulates effectively between lush description and tighter, climactic beats. Metaphors are mostly coherent and aligned (“quarantined memory,” “constellations of light”), and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. There is a mild risk of purple prose density in places, but it rarely obscures sense or momentum. Trimming a few abstract labels in favor of concrete sensations could refine an already polished style.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished and economical for its lyric mode; most sentences do double duty for mood and information. Figurative density is high but controlled, and metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than showy for their own sake. There is little to no paraphrase looping or scaffold phrasing; each paragraph advances either action or emotional framing. The closing cadence (“The key with no apparent lock had been her compass… And the treaty—ah, the treaty was her prayer”) lands cleanly without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally smooth, rhythmic, and clear, with strong sensory and figurative language that rarely confuses meaning. Some lines verge on purple or repetitive (“The echoes are not just sound” returns with slight variation; “universe’s secret song” appears more than once) but the pattern feels deliberate rather than purely redundant. There are no significant syntactic artifacts, scaffolding, or clarity glitches, and information density is decent for the length. Tightening a few abstractions and echoed phrases would further sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is mostly tight, with strong imagery and a good balance between description and movement; sentences often do double duty for mood and information. There are minor tendencies toward repetition and slightly purple abstraction (“windows of connection,” “fragile, enduring threads”) but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the final image is crisp and legible. Overall line-level craft is solidly publishable but not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence structures and generally high information density; most sentences do double duty in image and theme. The prose walks close to purple but stops short: figurative language is frequent yet coherent, and images are sensibly anchored in the scene. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and rhythm reads smoothly aloud. The main limitation is sheer lushness in a low-pressure scene, which slightly blurs momentum but doesn’t harm clarity or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus character plus atmosphere) without obvious padding, and the rhythm shifts well between summary and scene. Figurative language is selective and mostly effective; there’s little purple prose or metaphor muddle. There are minor clusters of modifiers and slightly expository sentences that could be trimmed or made more specific, but they don’t notably drag momentum. Overall, the prose is clean, clear, and professional, if not yet strikingly original.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length, imagery is often striking (“circuit board gone feral”), and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding + mood + character). The prose flirts with purple—stacked metaphors, frequent abstractions—yet clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts. Crucial actions (turning dials, activating mirrors, the glass shattering into color) are clear and well-timed. A bit more restraint in figurative density around peak beats would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sensory density, clean syntax, and sentences that often do double duty for mood and information. Occasional purple touches (“positively wistful gold,” “lonesome splendor”) are mostly earned by the overall aesthetic but could be pared for maximal sharpness. There’s minor redundancy around Elias’s purpose and the notion of sweetening silence, and the parenthetical revision jokes read as scaffolding rather than story. With some trimming of those artifacts, this would approach publish-ready polish.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally sharp, rhythmic, and information-dense, with imagery that aligns well to the sonic/light motifs. There is some tendency toward lushness and repetition of certain conceptual notes (key as legacy, balance, resonance) that nudges the edge of purple but doesn’t topple clarity or momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent and grounded, and the action lines in the central clash remain readable despite the lyric overlay. Trimming a handful of reiterated phrases and slightly abstract modifiers would tighten an already strong prose surface.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and imagery that usually does double duty (worldbuilding plus theme). Recurring metaphors (dance of moon and viaduct, filings’ movements) are coherent rather than mixed, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. A few phrases repeat verbatim (“sculpted patience from impatience,” “unyoke”), which reads more like motif than artifact but slightly blunts freshness. Overall, the prose is polished and propulsive enough for elite venues at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and concrete images that do double duty for mood and character. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines advance either atmosphere or narrative momentum. A few moments edge toward explanatory telling (“her empirical observation told her otherwise,” “She’d been a fool”) where the subtext is already clear, trimming some sharpness. Nonetheless, figurative language is controlled, clarity holds throughout, and the final paragraphs land with solid rhythmic and imagistic force.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lines are generally clean, fluent, and well-paced, with a good balance of description and movement. Some phrases are conventional or on-the-nose (“thick with the promise of a storm,” “symbol of hope,” “by the way light breaks through storm clouds”) and explanatory lines occasionally echo what the images already imply. Still, there are no serious redundancies, loops, or muddled metaphors; the prose remains clear and readable. Trimming cliché formulations and trusting images more would raise it toward a more distinctive literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient, with layered images often doing multiple jobs (world-building, tone, and character in one line). Metaphor and diction are coherent with the mechanical/acid aesthetic and rarely feel overwrought. Sentence rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, especially as the story shifts from workshop to sky. A few moments flirt with decorative description, but they don’t materially slow or blur the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, grammatical, and well-paced, with no major loops or scaffolding artifacts; momentum through the investigative sequence is maintained. There is some reliance on familiar genre phrasing and sensory shorthand (“sea of data streams,” “her heart raced”), and modifiers can stack toward the purple at times. Still, information density is reasonable, and key beats (decoding, the video reveal, the final confrontation) are depicted clearly. Line-level craft is solid but not yet sharpened to an elite, highly distinctive edge.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures and a strong ear for cadence; most lines do double duty in setting tone and advancing the scene. Imagery is largely coherent and vivid, and transitions between beats are smooth. There is some conceptual abstraction and mild repetition—phrases like “collective fear,” “mapping empathy,” and generalized “reminders” and “testaments” pull away from concrete embodiment. Trimming those and sharpening a few abstract nouns into specific images would heighten momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and purposeful, with generally high information density and little visible scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is used judiciously and mostly coherently (“wind through a cracked bell,” “fissure… that glowed faintly blue”), enhancing mood without obscuring action. The prose balances scene and summary smoothly, and the final paragraph lands on a clean, resonant image. There are occasional near-abstract formulations, but they don’t materially drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythms, clear syntax, and images that mostly pull their weight (“lacquered wood glowing like trapped sunlight,” “rows of vines stretching like frozen waves”). There’s minimal redundancy and no major scaffolding or template-cadence artifacts; each paragraph adds fresh information or texture. A few phrases lean toward the familiar or didactic, but they don’t seriously blunt momentum or clarity. Overall, this reads as publication-ready on a sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and generally economical despite the lush world-building. Metaphor and invented terms are consistent and rarely feel overwrought; repeated phrases (“whisperfield calm,” “echo of wisdom”) function as motifs rather than dead loops. There are no significant rhythm glitches, scaffolding lines, or clarity issues, and the closing images land cleanly. A touch more sharpening around moments of pressure could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images precise, and there’s good information density without scaffolding or obvious loops. Recurring metaphors (arcs, vines, rust becoming art) are coherent and purposeful rather than decorative. The prose edges toward the lush, but doesn’t tip into muddle or cliché, and momentum is adequate for a quiet story. There’s room to tighten a few repeated thematic statements, but nothing significantly dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong: clear, rhythmic, and image-rich without major clutter, and most sentences carry more than one layer of work (setting, mood, theme). There are mild repetitions ("suspended hush," "patterns," "fractured sequences") and a few slightly purple or redundant turns, but they don’t significantly slow momentum. Figurative language is mostly consistent and apt, particularly around light and the crystal’s refractions. Line-level craft is publishable with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are precise and image-rich, often doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization (e.g., visions dissolving “like sugar in tea,” gravel as “part of someone’s demolished life”). The prose avoids obvious redundancy and template cadences; repeated images (fog, echoes, chalk) read as intentional motif rather than loop. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple or obscure action, and the syntax remains clear throughout. Minor familiarity in a few metaphors keeps it just below the highest tiers, but line-level craft is solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally tight and propulsive: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, mood, and plot) without padding. There are occasional clichéd or weaker images (“like boiling milk,” “luminous ache”) and a fairly dense layer of figurative language, but it rarely muddies clarity. The prose avoids noticeable loops or scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum through the climax. With a small trim of familiar metaphors, this would be comfortably elite-level.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and a high information density—most lines carry multiple functions (scene, emotion, theme). Metaphors like “pulsing stillness” and “lavender and hope” are striking without becoming too mixed or obscure, and there are no real scaffold or paraphrase loops. At times the language brushes purple and sentimental, particularly in the final paragraphs, which slightly blunts edge and restraint. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the overall line-level craft is solidly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and economical, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus concept). There are occasional familiar formulations and light purple flourishes, but they don’t obscure meaning or stall momentum. Information is well sequenced, copy errors are absent, and the final lines land crisply with a clear image of shadows condensing beneath the isle. Sharpening a few slightly stock phrases and tightening one or two summary passages would make the line-level work feel fully publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and often elegant, with strong images like “whispers of forgotten seasons” and the garden as a “tapestry of memories.” Sentences usually do double duty—advancing atmosphere and interiority together—without obvious scaffold or redundancy. A few turns of phrase edge toward purple or generalized wisdom, slightly reducing immediacy at peak moments. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and there are no significant line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong image-making (“zephyr bloom—a fragrance like jasmine and ozone,” “a pearl of stillness”) and solid syntactic variety; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, and character). A few phrases edge toward purple or repetition (“memories resurfaced” appears more than once; some adjectives could be pared), but they don’t materially obscure sense or slow momentum. There are no notable scaffolding loops or mechanical cadences, and grammar and sequencing are clean. Overall, line-level craft is well above average and nearly publication-ready in this register.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, efficient, and often do double duty—advancing image and character in the same move (“servers as anchors,” “mapped the building’s heartbeat”). Figurative language is generally precise and thematically coherent: grafting, icicle patterns, resin/amber, and moss all interlock rather than feeling like a grab bag. There’s minimal redundancy and no major loops or clutter; the only minor issue is occasional near-platitudinous phrasing that could be sharpened for surprise. The closure image is clear and uncluttered, allowing earlier motifs to reverberate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythmic control and dense, often evocative images (e.g., time and truth tangling like kelp; travelers flickering like breath on glass). There is some repetition of motifs (“current,” “hope,” “endings,” “whispering pages”) and a tendency toward abstract or thesis-like statements that could be pared back. Still, sentences usually do multiple jobs—advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously—without major scaffolding or muddled metaphor. Line-level craft is strong but not yet razor-honed enough for the very top echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory density and many effective images (threads spinning stories, mushrooms bursting where stories land, streams taking up the melody). Sentences typically do multiple jobs—advancing action, building atmosphere, and revealing character—and the piece reads smoothly. There are a few familiar turns of phrase (“liquid gold,” “tinkling bells”) and a near-constant metaphorical shimmer that occasionally edges toward the ornate. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong images (“apples hung like frost-bitten lanterns,” “liquid silver”) and good integration of description with action. There is some tendency toward reiterative phrasing and explicit explanation—especially around the thematic epiphany—but not to the point of real drag or confusion. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors. Line-level craft is solid and publication-ready, though it doesn’t quite reach the compression and surprise of elite literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and character. The figurative language is mostly precise and coherent, giving the prose a refined, literary texture without tipping into full purple prose. There are minor tendencies toward repetition of conceptual framing (“cellar of reason,” “wounded season”) and a generally uniform lyric register that slightly flattens dynamic contrast, but no major loops or scaffolding. Momentum is well-maintained for a reflective piece, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images precise, and most carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without bloat. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and thematically aligned; it rarely strays into mixed or competing metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and transitions are smooth without dulling momentum given the accumulative design. A few phrases flirt with over-ornamentation, but they do not materially obscure sense or closure, so the prose reads ready for a high-level market with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is high: varied sentence rhythms, dense but generally clear imagery, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. The prose often does double duty, using physical detail to carry emotional and thematic weight, and the read-aloud cadence is strong. There are moments where figurative language stacks (“crystallized time,” “hauntingly practical truth,” “watercolor haze”) that flirt with purple and risk over-decorating relatively low-pressure beats. Still, clarity is maintained throughout, and no metaphorical muddle or repetition undercuts the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and largely free of scaffolding or loops; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and integrated (“voice like grinding gears,” “sun hung like a stuck coin”), with only occasional near-familiar phrases (“Regret coiled in Veyra’s chest”) that slightly flatten originality. Rhythm varies well between long, lush description and tighter beats of dialogue. Nothing at the line level obscures causality or mutes the closure image, and there’s no evident padding.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and information-dense, with strong verbs and purposeful imagery (“bruised twilight sky,” “sound like wind through a forgotten city”). There is some lexical and conceptual repetition around “functional,” “flows,” “resurrection,” and “hope” that could be trimmed or varied. Figurative language is controlled and rarely overstacked; rhythm feels natural on a read-aloud test. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but not yet razor-honed or surprising at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythms, clean syntax, and compact, multi-tasking descriptions. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and not muddled (“the soundless sanctuary…breathed like a dormant beast” lands and is revisited tonally). There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious template cadences or scaffolding; momentum holds despite the lyricism. A few abstractions and slightly purple moments keep it from the very top band, but they don’t harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid images (“eyes like drowned coins,” “contents spilling out like forgotten memories”) and mostly efficient sentences that carry both mood and information. Some metaphors verge on purple or repetitive (“architecture of lies,” reiterations of what the sundial “isn’t just”), but they don’t seriously obscure meaning or stall momentum. There are no obvious loops, template cadences, or technical errors. Tightening a few explanatory lines would sharpen propulsion and let the best images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “spirals that pulsed faintly, as if remembering the lightning strike that birthed it” are vivid and purposeful. Most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little padding, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it rarely feels overwrought or mixed, and clarity is maintained throughout. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences that drag momentum, especially near the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied, and dense with meaning, and images like “her chest ached with lonesome splendor” are striking. There is some conceptual redundancy and a few over-explicit or familiar formulations (“a map of lives restored,” “a chance to understand, to heal, and to remember”) that soften impact. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent rather than muddled. Trimming a handful of summarizing or slogan-like lines would sharpen the overall propulsion and let the best images stand out.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and good sentence-level rhythm that sustains atmosphere and momentum (“hung in the abyss like a frozen tear”). Information density is high, and most lines pull double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. There is a tendency toward stacked figurative language (“liquid light,” “distant trill,” “bitterly sweet crescendo”) that edges toward purple and could be pared back for even greater impact. Nonetheless, clarity remains intact, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or redundancy artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: images are sharp, syntax is varied, and most sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without bloat. The figurative language (“scars could sing,” “clouds migrate”) is largely coherent and not overstacked for this quiet scene. A few formulations edge toward purple or overtly thematic, particularly in the closing paragraph, but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the prose sustains a smooth read-aloud rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythms, clear sequencing, and lines that often do double duty for atmosphere and story. Some metaphors and abstractions (“realistically imaginative,” “sidereal patience,” “defiant hush”) repeat or verge on purple, and emotional states are occasionally labeled more than dramatized. Still, there are few if any genuine artifacts, and momentum is not significantly hampered by ornamentation. The closing passages are clear and visually resonant, even if slightly over-explicit thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: rich but controlled imagery, good rhythmic variation, and high information density with few wasted lines. Metaphors (e.g., petals as constellations, gear teeth approximating infinity) are striking and internally coherent. There is mild repetition of conceptual language (“quiet,” “infinite,” “generational patterns”) and a few lines that restate insights already implied, which slightly blunts momentum. Overall clarity remains high and the closure image is clean and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, theme), and the prose reads smoothly aloud with good rhythmic variation. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and apt (“thundering calm,” butterflies’ shadows “like living embers”), without collapsing into mixed-metaphor muddle. There are no conspicuous loops or scaffolding sentences; momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. A few phrases verge on purple, yet they don’t materially obscure sense or dilute the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are sharp (“obsidian into jagged teeth”), and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and stakes. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle or mixed metaphors. There are a few slightly abstract or redundant phrasings, yet they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity, and the closure image lands cleanly. This is near–publish-ready prose with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight and fluent, with good rhythm and vivid imagery, and it avoids serious clarity issues. There is some tendency toward purple or stacked abstraction (“a dance of intentions played out across time”), but metaphors rarely become mixed or confusing. Most sentences carry multiple functions—advancing atmosphere and concept together—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The language is strong enough for competitive markets, though trimming a few ornamental phrases would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid images, purposeful detail, and clean syntax that carries momentum without clutter. There’s some tendency toward repetition of ideas (her method, the contrast of data and imagination) and mildly purple turns, but they don’t significantly impede clarity. Sentences often pull double duty—advancing setting and theme together—which keeps information density high. The final paragraphs in particular land with a clear, charged image and no noticeable line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, with few redundancies and clear temporal sequencing. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful, building a consistent atmospheric palette rather than a muddle; images like “mist curled like smoke from forgotten hearths” and “the wall itself were breathing” are vivid and on-theme. A mild density of modifiers and metaphors risks saturation, especially mid-story, but rarely impedes clarity or momentum. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or structural artifacts, though a bit more austerity in high-intensity beats could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line by line, the prose is strong: sentences generally carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and the rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical. Some metaphors and abstractions repeat (“mirage of safety,” “like the final note of a violin,” “glittering like stardust”), edging into mild purple prose and softening impact by over-insisting on beauty. There are occasional generic phrases (“etched with fatigue and resolve,” “like everything here”) that sit below the surrounding originality. Still, clarity is never compromised, and the closing images are clean and legible, with only minor trimming needed for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is vivid and efficient; metaphors like “a razor wrapped in silk” and “a sound like gravel in a tin can” are concrete and character-fitting rather than decorative. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing keep momentum, and most lines do double duty (setting + character, or image + theme). There’s minimal redundancy and no serious scaffolding artifacts, though a few phrases lean toward density (“putrid perfume,” “unmediated truth”) without tipping into purple. The final third remains clear and charged, with no figurative muddle obstructing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs, and images that usually do more than one job (the rosette as both heirloom and thematic emblem). There is some repetition of conceptual vocabulary (“noise,” “harmony,” “language of the soul”) and a few slightly familiar formulations, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or muddy sense. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled; mixed metaphors are avoided, and the prose remains clear even in its densest moments. This is high-quality, publishable prose that could be sharpened further by trimming a few abstract turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with clear sequencing, economical description, and a few strong images (the translucent, glowing bud; the sculpture of light and life) doing multi-layered work. There’s some repetition of key phrases (“gentle rebellion,” “create something beautiful from the ruins”) that lightly blunt impact, but not to the level of real scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is restrained and coherent; no mixed metaphors or purple patches derail momentum. Line-level craft is solidly above average but not yet at the razor-sharp density associated with top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level writing is generally clean, vivid, and economical, with images like “the way the light turned golden and syrupy, as if the world were dipped in honey” providing memorable texture without overwhelming clarity. Sentences vary in structure and length, maintaining momentum and avoiding obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A few explanatory passages (“The tower runs on more than electricity…”) edge toward on-the-nose, but they don’t significantly drag pace. No major figurative muddle or syntactic artifacts interfere with the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are generally clear, and most carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and legible; only a few moments approach purple without tipping into muddle. There’s little paraphrase looping or scaffolding, and momentum is maintained despite a contemplative pace. With a shade more pruning of abstract statements, this would be top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and most lines carry more than one function (worldbuilding, emotion, and action in the same breath). Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple, and metaphors are coherent with the underwater, bioluminescent milieu. There are minor redundancies (“first revelation… second… third”) and a few explanatory phrases that could be cut for even greater tautness. Overall, momentum and clarity are well maintained without visible scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphorical language is mostly precise and apt, and there is little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Images tend to do double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“ozone and regret,” the staircase rearranging “like a deck of cards”). A few moments risk piling abstractions (texture/shape of loss, perpetual motion as “a wound that heals by bleeding forever”), but they remain legible and don’t clog momentum. The final paragraphs, in particular, are clean and well-cadenced.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely economical despite its lyricism, with many lines doing double duty for mood and characterization (“cataloging kindnesses like fossils”). Metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent; a few verge on lush, but they rarely feel redundant or confusing. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping to slow momentum. Slight tightening around repeated thematic statements could heighten impact further, but line-level craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious padding. Figurative language is present but not overwhelmingly dense, and most metaphors land cleanly in the story’s sensory and thematic register. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or generic scaffolding sentences; the prose maintains good momentum despite its reflective bent. Occasional phrases flirt with purple, but they don’t materially obscure sense or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is vivid and efficient: most sentences carry multiple jobs (advancing mechanism, mood, and character) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent with the maritime/temporal imagery; rhythm varies well across the scene. There are no significant loops, scaffolding phrases, or line-level confusions that bog momentum, especially in the closing beats. Minor repetition of key terms (“hunger,” “radiance”) reads as motif rather than artifact, keeping this just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean yet vivid, with figurative language that mostly clarifies rather than obscures (“mirrors cracking like ice,” “a thousand moths”). There’s good information density; description, mood, and plot advancements frequently share the same line. While the metaphoric load is fairly high, it doesn’t tip into muddle or redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. Minor tightening could come from trimming a few near-synonymous intensifiers, but there are no serious artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished: varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic echo). The “cumulus scrolls,” “fractal generating,” and “ghost of her composition” stretches are lush yet intelligible, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is some risk of metaphor saturation, but it stops short of obscuring causality or dulling the closure image. With slightly more ruthlessness in pruning decorative metaphors, this could edge into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and often do double duty for atmosphere and plot, with few if any redundant scaffolding lines. Imagery like “light itself were afraid to define them” and “the shells are alive. They’re hungry” is vivid without becoming muddled. Momentum stays brisk, and exposition is efficiently woven into action instead of stalling it. A few metaphors and emotional beats lean familiar rather than singular, placing this just under the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is generally precise and economical, with strong images (“brickwork softened into greenish folds”) doing multiple jobs—atmosphere, theme, and tone. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there are few, if any, genuine artifacts or redundancies that drag momentum. Some abstractions (“noble lies,” “cautionary parallel”) are repeated and explained where a bit more trust in the reader would sharpen impact, but this doesn’t seriously obscure clarity. The final paragraph edges toward aphoristic neatness, slightly dulling the closing image’s sting.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied in length, and usually do more than one job (advancing scene, revealing character, and sustaining atmosphere). Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to obscure clarity, and mixed metaphors are largely avoided. There’s little evident scaffolding or repetition; the prose keeps moving and the final image lands cleanly. Some phrases flirt with purple, but they remain intelligible and tonally appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally lean and purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and narrative progression. Imagery is frequent but mostly coherent and in-register with the setting; it rarely tangles or obscures basic sense. There are isolated moments of abstraction or near-platitude (“raw, unvarnished, and heavy”) and adjective stacking, but they don’t materially drag momentum or clarity. Sentence rhythms and paragraphing vary enough to keep the piece readable and propulsive at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors or clutter that would obscure sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; the narrative moves forward briskly despite its lyricism. At times, the density of imagery lightly flirts with purple prose, but clarity and momentum remain intact, especially at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythm, vivid images (“a sound like shattered glass,” “fractal shadows,” “veins of light”) and good information density with little dead scaffolding. A few moments flirt with purple or redundancy (repeated framing of “unused potential,” multiple instances of “she laughed”), and some metaphors are conceptually heavy, leaning toward slogan rather than texture. The climactic explanation of unused potential is more told than shown, slightly flattening momentum, but clarity is never lost. With a bit of tightening and more restraint in thematic lines, this would approach top-tier prose for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: vivid metaphors like “crown of shadows” and “frequency of belonging” are clear and coherent with the world, and there’s minimal redundancy. Most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and action) without bogging down momentum. There is some density of descriptive language, but it stops short of purple prose and remains legible under pressure. No noticeable syntactic tics or artifacts undermine the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually carry multiple functions (atmosphere, theme, and character). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; metaphors like guilt as barnacles and the ocean preserving buried truths are coherent and apt. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and sentences generally propel rather than stall. A very slight tendency toward purple phrasing in the closing paragraphs keeps it from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are concrete, metaphors generally clean, and most sentences do more than one job (“every mistake has a handle. Something to grip when you’re sliding.”). There’s a consistent, pleasing rhythm without obvious template cadence or synonym loops. The lyricism approaches purple at moments (“furrowed hush,” “sea swallowed all lies”) but remains legible and purposeful, not obscuring action or causality. Minor redundancy in thematic phrasing exists but doesn’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with good rhythm, varied sentence structure, and high information density; almost every line advances mood, character, or theme. Some figurative language edges toward purple and explanatory (“regret wasn’t a compass; it was a tide”), and there is occasional conceptual repetition around regret and hiding. These choices don’t break clarity but modestly blunt momentum and subtlety. Overall, the line-level craft is above-average and publishable with light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line, the piece is concise and mostly free of scaffolding or synonym loops; nearly every sentence advances either image, premise, or character. Figurative language is selective and generally coherent with the world and mood, avoiding purple excess despite a few elevated phrases. Syntax varies enough to maintain rhythm, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, charged image. There is some reliance on abstract nouns (“empathy,” “regret,” “labyrinth”) where concrete embodiment could sharpen impact, but it does not seriously impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong imagery, and high information density; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, interiority) without obvious scaffolding. Line-level momentum is well maintained, and figurative language generally clarifies rather than obscures. There are minor tendencies toward purple/summary-thematic phrasing in places (“cosmic intimacy,” the explicit thematic closer) that slightly dull the edge for elite literary markets. Still, no major artifacts or loops impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied syntax, strong verbs, and dense images that often multitask (world-building, mood, and interiority at once). The prose verges on purple in places, with a high frequency of figurative language (“air tasted of ozone and old starlight,” “roots coiled like hourglasses”), but it remains largely clear and purposeful rather than decorative noise. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or mechanical cadences, and the final paragraphs land with clean, evocative images. A slight easing of metaphor density at peak emotional beats could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally vivid and economical, with strong images like “a droplet of liquid light trapped in a locket forged from a collapsed star” and “long-dried tears on faded photographs” doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, theme). While the language edges toward purple in places, it seldom tips into muddle or redundancy, and sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum. Minor repetitions exist but don’t significantly blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“bottled lightning bug collection—stolen moments of light”) and a good balance between lyricism and clarity. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and characterization without obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few thematic statements could be trimmed for greater sharpness, but they don’t muddy causality or the closing image. There’s little to no figurative muddle or clutter, and the final paragraphs land cleanly on image and sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and easy to follow; sentences generally carry more than one piece of information without obvious scaffolding. There are some repeated motifs and slightly purple turns (“cradle of sparks,” “winking hush”) that start to feel thematic rather than texturally fresh. Expository lines occasionally tell what is already implied, but not to the point of real drag. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum, even if not especially striking.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors, good sentence variety, and high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, world, or pressure simultaneously. Some phrases edge toward purple or abstract (“twisting the promise into a knot,” “the star dust screamed”) and key concepts (“patterns,” “sacred”) recur in similar formulations, creating a slight echo-chamber effect. Still, clarity is consistently high; cause/effect and spatial relations remain legible, and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. The closure image is sharp and not muddied by figurative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and generally high in information density, with images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. The prose maintains momentum despite being reflection-heavy, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. However, the figurative load is consistently high—nearly every paragraph leans into simile or metaphor—which edges toward overwriting in places and slightly blurs the impact of standout lines. Trimmed or varied density in a few spots would sharpen the overall effect at an elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and most lines do more than one job (image + theme + motion). There is some risk of overpolish and repetition of abstract terms (“questions,” “map,” “language,” “philosophy”), but it does not cross into true purple prose or significant redundancy. The prose could be tightened slightly by trimming explanatory tags and overt summarizing in the final paragraph, which currently tells what the images have already shown. Overall, the writing is publishable with light line edits rather than overhaul.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally taut, vivid, and rhythmic, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Key images are memorable and mostly precise, and the narrative flows smoothly without obvious scaffolding or redundant loops. There are a few familiar turns of phrase (“garden of words,” “hungry and indifferent city”) and some conceptual repetition around blooming/resistance/rebuilding that slightly dulls the edge. Still, no figurative muddle harms clarity at the end, and line-level control is strong enough for near-publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: rhythmic variety, high information density, and vivid images that usually do more than one job. Figurative language is fairly dense but not incoherent; metaphors tend to be internally consistent and anchored in Clara’s frame of reference. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and sentences generally propel mood or action. The prose occasionally leans toward the purple (“the chaos of choice”) but not enough to stall momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and rarely feel redundant. The figurative language is frequent but mostly precise (“ferns unfurled like emerald scrolls,” “liquid light”) and avoids mixed-metaphor muddle. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences; information moves forward with good momentum for such a descriptive piece. A few abstractions (“collective memory…a tapestry,” “empirically whimsical”) slightly thin immediacy, but they don’t materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensory details are concrete, and metaphors like “where the sky met the sea in a bruise of cerulean” feel precise rather than generic. Prose mostly pulls double duty, advancing both scene and mood without obvious scaffolding or repetition. There’s a mild tendency toward elevated, quasi-aphoristic phrasing that edges close to purple in a few lines, but it doesn’t obscure meaning or momentum. The closing cadence is clean and earned.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density, though occasionally heavy-handed with metaphorical pairings ("waveform of a dying pulsar"). The scientific terminology is integrated without disrupting flow.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is dense with adjective-noun pairings and metaphors (“shimmered like trapped auroras,” “ancient ribs”), creating a sluggish rhythm. Reliance on abstract telling (“survival had left her hollow”) dilutes the immediacy of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose relies heavily on telling ("Lirael’s motivation was personal") and clichés ("swallowed by the storm," "heart racing"). Summary transitions ("Days passed") sap momentum, preventing any rhythmic build-up in the line work.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from "tells" ("inadvertently stubborn nature flaring") and explanatory metaphors ("like scars turned to art"). The pacing drags in the summary sections, reducing the impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with clear imagery. However, a few tired similes ("frayed like old rope") dampen the freshness, and the reliance on summary for key exposition reduces the immediate impact of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("breath visible in the cooling air," "still as glass") and abstractions ("essence of compassion"). The reliance on "hues that defied naming" creates a vacuum of imagery where specific detail is most needed.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "purple" artifacts and mixed metaphors, such as a breeze that "tasted of salt and regret," which confuse sensory detail with abstract emotion. The density of figurative language ("curled like dry leaves," "erased by an invisible hand") occasionally clutters the pacing of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by stock phrasing and filter verbs ("smelled of," "knew she had to"). Descriptions often lean into overwrought imagery ("hues of twilight") that distracts from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is frequently overwrought, relying heavily on adjective-noun stacking ("ghostly static," "rusted hulls," "skeletal ribs," "jagged shadows," "spectral light"). Abstractions like "promises unraveling" are treated as sensory details, which weakens the concreteness of the synesthesia. The density of modifiers drags on the pacing in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mechanically functional, but the prose suffers from "prompt artifact" insertion ("quietly savvy" used as a modifier twice) and some cliché imagery ("laughter frozen in time"). The density of figurative language occasionally obscures the physical action, particularly during the heist sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mechanics are solid, but the prose relies on familiar imagery ("echoing like a ticking clock," "dancing dust motes"). The writing tells the reader how to feel ("words felt absurd, yet they lent weight") rather than evoking the sensation through action.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose is functional but dense with "purple" descriptors and telling; phrases like "half-orphan, half-lie" strain for poetic effect but land as abstraction. Clichés and summary ("Weeks later") undercut the momentum of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive tagging ("ambered hush" twice, "marbled hush" once) and the forced insertion of prompt phrases that break rhythm. The reliance on "as if" similes and abstract metaphors ("palimpsest of echoes") reduces immediacy and narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is competent but repetitive, with &quot;remarkably composed&quot; and &quot;amalgamate&quot; appearing as forced anchors. Abstract phrasing like &quot;emotional residue&quot; and &quot;fractal&quot; replaces concrete action during the pivotal transformation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("thought," "realized") and awkward prompt insertions like "ambiguously clear," which reads as a forced oxymoron. The reliance on explaining the magic ("phenomenon unexplained by science") rather than showing its effects flattens the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.8)
    Generally competent, but marred by a notable subject-verb agreement error ("Each morning, Elara polish the marbles") and the clumsy repetition of "dresser" in the first paragraph. The phrase "movements wisely pragmatic" is a "tell" that relies on adverbs rather than specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is mechanically competent but marred by clichés ("stomach dropped," "hands flew") and prompt-forced phrasing that sits awkwardly in the sentences. The repetition of the "hush" phrase works as a bracket but feels slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent and moves well, with some strong imagery ("bleed through"). However, it relies on familiar phrasings ("chill down her spine," "held its breath") and some filter verbs that distance the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("hands like tree bark," "swallowed truth") and strained personification ("sky itself were wincing"). While the rhythm is competent, the tendency to immediately interpret metaphors for the reader ("a map of her own fractures") reduces density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is functional but marred by cliché personification ("tunnel yawned," "dawn bled," "shadows danced like living things") and "felt like" similes that distance the reader from the immediate experience. While readable, the line-level craft lacks freshness and relies on standard thriller vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.6)
    A severe template cadence disrupts the middle section, where four consecutive narrative beats begin with variations of "The [ordinal] fold [verb]" (led, pointed, guided, led). This repetitive scaffolding reduces the journey to a mechanical list and significantly drags on momentum and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is overwritten with poetic fallacies ("hush of dreaming roots," "ancient veins") and abstract tells ("softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance") that stall momentum. Adjective-heavy descriptions clutter the line level without adding specific, actionable information.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is functional but marred by "telling" modifiers (e.g., the awkward stack "sensitively perceptive gaze") and clichés ("chill down his spine"). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience, reducing the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose relies on stock clichés ("silver blade," "steady as a heartbeat," "game was afoot") and abstract metaphors ("words tasted like fate"). These artifacts dull the imagery and reduce the literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.7)
    Competent mechanics, but the prose relies on stock imagery ("time folded like origami," "shadows that danced like dervishes") and telling ("paradoxes that unraveled certainty"). These clichés blunt the intended surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic but leans toward adjectival stacking ("prismatic," "cryptic") that occasionally slows momentum. The requisite phrase "chronological homesickness" reads as a clunky, diagnostic implant that clashes with the surrounding poetic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by oxymoronic clunkiness ("darkening brightness" used twice) and telling-heavy constructions. Several clichés ("heart heavy," "beauty in the chaos") flatten the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished and readable but suffers from simile overload ("like a question she’d forgotten how to ask") and diagnostic telling. The specific prompt phrase "faint rustle of turning seasons" is integrated but feels flowery and conspicuous.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.4)
    The text contains a critical subject-verb agreement error ("He intuit that...") that renders the sentence ungrammatical, a fatal flaw for a prestigious market. Prompt phrases are integrated clumsily (e.g., "Credibly curious" is an awkward modifier; "Progressing laterally" is used as a transition for vertical movement). These artifacts disrupt momentum and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies on stock metaphors and clichés ("hit her like a wave," "sacred energy," "spiraling into grief") that dull the imagery. "Suddenly" is used to bridge the climax, bypassing causal density, and the reliance on abstract descriptors prevents higher engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level imagery is often strong ("coat full of half-finished verses"), creating good information density. However, the awkward adjectival insertion of the required attribute and some density of abstract metaphors in the climax hold it back.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from abstraction ("fogged with salt and memory") and telling-not-showing ("magnificent simplicity"). The reliance on standard narrative bridges ("Tonight, she would break it") creates a manufactured feel that smooths over potential textural friction.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant cliché usage ("sparkled with anticipation," "liquid moonlight," "etched with weariness") that degrades literary quality. "Tell" phrases replace active description (e.g., "His professionally thorough nature demanded..."), resulting in low information density and a lack of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies heavily on adjectival padding and abstract telling ("curiosity, that rare and prickly emotion," "cautious exuberance"). While mechanically functional, the density of modifiers and stock imagery ("heels crunching gravel") prevents immediate engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("liquid mercury," "pulsing like a heartbeat," "hit him like a physical blow") and filter verbs ("he thought he saw"). The reliance on "telling" through abstract adjectives ("luminescent ache") prevents the imagery from becoming tactile or immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by somatic clichés ("breath hitched," "gasped," "frozen mid-flap") and scaffold phrases ("Lila's mind raced"). These artifacts distance the reader from the physical reality of the scene. The "diver through syrup" simile is a familiar trope that dilutes the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but overwrought with adjectives ("luminescent," "ethereal," "pale") that dilute the imagery. There is a tendency toward abstract telling ("the mathematics of emotion lay in such fractures") over concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is marred by "telling" artifacts ("Mara’s kindly nature," "methodical routine") and strained metaphors ("staining the air a sapphire hush"). The reliance on adjectives and abstract nouns to convey significance ("sapphire hush," "unexpected outage") weakens the line-level momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.8)
    A significant tautological simile in the opening ("clinging to her skin like a second skin") undermines the prose immediately. The writing relies on clichés ("breath thick and electric," "simply *was*") and filter verbs ("She thought of...") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the imagery is often strong, the prose suffers from specific artifacts, including the verbatim repetition of "wryly earnest" and the awkward insertion of "haggard awe" as a tell. Some metaphors feel slightly overwrought ("drowned the mainland's arrogance") and impede flow.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and flows well, with strong imagery ("overlapping shadows," "teeth like polished onyx"). There are minor lapses into slightly purple phrasing ("dew into diamonds"), but line-level craft is generally competent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is marred by forced integration of prompt terms, leading to clunky phrasing like "Lirael’s hearten strategy" (using a verb as an adjective) and the jargon-heavy "reactively visionary." These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and highlight the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lexical repetition undermines the prose; the root word &quot;trembling&quot; appears three times (&quot;trembling finger,&quot; &quot;trembling certainty&quot; twice), creating a distracting artifact. While the imagery is often vivid, the reliance on specific phrases reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose relies on clichés ("unheard symphonies," "haunting chorus") and adverb-heavy telling ("courageously kind") rather than concrete imagery. Line-level density is low, with frequent filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") diluting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from adjective stacking ("prismatic," "fractured," "defiant") and cliché ("senses tingled," "symphony of possibilities"). Repetitive descriptors ("defiant moon," "defiant star") and "tell" phrasing ("Intrigue, he thought") weaken the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean and readable with appropriate pacing, though some phrasing is functional rather than evocative. There is a tendency to "tell" significance ("It’s a breach point") rather than letting the action carry the weight, but line-level mechanics are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is marred by stock phrasing ("cracks of history," "bird taking flight," "dizzying dance") and purple descriptors. The rhythm is monotonous, and the reliance on adjectives over strong verbs dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("hit like a tidal wave," "swallowed them whole") and overwrought similes ("clawed at the bruised sky"). Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "Description, reflection" cadence that slows momentum. The writing tells the reader what to feel ("The realization hit...") instead of evoking the sensation through specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional but cluttered with "workshop" artifacts and strained metaphors ("unsent letters," "fossilized question"). The visual logic of a musical staff "scrawled in dust" appearing spontaneously is blurry.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but relies on stock phrasing ("voice like ice," "flicker of hope") and clichés. While readable, the line-level craft lacks the textural density or fresh imagery required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and readable, with moments of lyricism ("first whispers of Earth’s dawn"). However, it occasionally leans into clichés ("gloves trembled," "indifference of the cosmos") and abstract telling that dulls the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose relies on stock phrases ("clung like a second skin," "skeletal frame," "liquid sunlight") and adjective-noun pairings that feel generated rather than observed. The "heartfelt artisan" tag acts as a tell, and the rhythm is competent but lacks a distinct textural signature.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose suffers from awkward phrasing to accommodate prompt elements ("subtly confident finger") and abstract telling ("It was a knowing"). The reliance on adjectives and philosophical summary slows momentum and reduces clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose has a strong rhythmic quality and uses intentional repetition effectively, though it is weakened by occasional stock similes ("scattered like ash") and adjectival padding that softens the impact of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is readable and clear but relies on expository shortcuts ("The temple’s purpose revealed itself") and stock metaphors ("coiled like eels," "frozen in amber"). These artifacts reduce the immediacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is suffocated by a high density of similes ("twisted like a question," "gnawing like teeth," "seeped like old blood," "like shattering glass," "like puzzle pieces"). This reliance on "like" constructions obstructs the action. Additionally, there is a basic proofreading error ("a affirmation") and the figurative language often muddles the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is overwritten and dense with adjectival padding ("latent magic," "smoke-gray silk") and filter verbs. The required phrases are inserted awkwardly ("through ephemeral cameo appearances"), disrupting the rhythm and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from simile density ("like exhausted eyes," "like a nervous system," "like a question mark," "like a heartbeat") which creates a scaffolded feel. Noun stacks like "storybook illustration plate" are repeated fully, causing rhythm drag. Telling phrasing ("Lira’s method was via...") reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("twisting like serpents," "heart racing," "breath catching," "sun-bleached bones") that dull the imagery. The summary transition ("Days passed") creates a lethargic rhythm in the center of the story, killing the line-level propulsion established in the tomb descent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is competent but leans into "purple" tendencies with phrases like "ebony clipboard" and "intoned" for a machine's output. The simile "clicking like a countdown" attempts to manufacture tension that the plot does not support. Line-level craft is functional but lacks the precision required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies on stock similes ("sound like wind chimes," "darted like comets") and clichés ("veil of lies") that reduce literary freshness. While grammatically functional, the density is low, and the imagery leans toward flowery decoration rather than precision.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is clean and readable but relies on "telling" artifacts ("She understood the weight," "Her motivation was simple") and stock imagery. The writing lacks the density and freshness required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("ghost's fingers," "swallowed her words") and mixed metaphors ("defusing landmine metaphors") that obscure clarity. The sentimentality in lines like "the ocean heals in whispers" undermines the gravity of the conflict zone setting.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on stock phrases and clichés ("clung like a second skin," "skeletal remains," "piercing the silence") that dull the imagery's impact. Filter verbs ("felt like," "watched as") distance the reader from the immediate experience. While the rhythm is competent, the density of "writerly" descriptors creates a surface-level sheen that lacks fresh, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished, but the text suffers from significant artifacting due to the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("methodically playful" appears three times; "pause between question and reply" twice). These repetitions act as visible scaffolding that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional and clear, moving the action forward without confusion, but relies on stock phrasing ("pulse quickened," "piercing through the steam"). Some descriptions border on cartoonish ("moths formed a living arrow"), and the "symphony" of chaos feels like a cliché. There are no major mechanical errors, but the line-level craft does not elevate the material.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is often overwritten, relying on dense adjectival stacking ("reef-shadow joy," "liquid stars") and mixed metaphors ("photosynthesize pain," "margins of exhaustion") that obscure clarity. The repetition of "off-key wind" and the summary-heavy delivery stall narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from adjectival density ("opalescent static," "iridescent mist," "crystalline hybrid") that slows momentum. The phrasing borders on "purple" in places, reducing the sharpness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but repetitive with key phrases ("unsnarled," "reckless") and relies on cliché ("ink-stained fingers"). The use of abstract metaphors ("symphonies of truth") in place of concrete description reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is dense with "purple" metaphors that obscure clarity ("adhesive... a map of secrets," "dappled resolve shimmering"). Several prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly as text artifacts ("slyly heartfelt nature," "dappled resolve"), disrupting the narrative flow and feeling like a checklist completion.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent and legible, with some strong visual cues. However, it relies heavily on "to be" verbs and summary telling ("The method was absurd, he knew"). The pacing drags during the summary section, and the line-level logic of the dust map explanation is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally lapses into "purple" abstraction (e.g., "mosaic of relief and regret"). While the imagery is often striking, the reliance on adjectival stacking and abstract nouns creates a barrier to immediate engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" tendencies ("fleeting dance," "grand, chaotic symphony") that reduce density. The phrase "shadowseam wonder" reads as a forced prompt insertion that disrupts the lexical register. Adverb-adjective clusters like "softly ingenious" tell rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from dense adjectival stacking and synesthesia that borders on vague ("prismatic whispers," "regret... like molasses"). A grammatical slip ("a iridescent thrush") and the reliance on ornamental similes slow the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from "purple" tendencies ("flickering like nervous fish," "ocean’s breath") that call attention to themselves. The insertion of the prompt phrase "lightly attentive" feels mechanical and disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from noun clusters ("moonstone cabochon dust speck") and mixed metaphors ("air hummed with obsidian grace") that obscure clarity. Intense adjectives and "purple" phrasing ("gravity became a suggestion") draw attention to the writing itself rather than the action, creating drag at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("still as glass," "promise of day," "tapestry of colors," "morning glory") that dilute the imagery. While grammatically sound, the writing relies on familiar "workshop" phrasing rather than specific, fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("spilled milk," "face only a mirror could love," "holding his breath") and mixed metaphors. Phrases like "liquid silver" and "cracks ran like veins" are standard stock imagery. The prompt keywords are shoehorned into sentences ("ready to enlighten himself—by reflecting deeply"), disrupting the natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the syntax is smooth, the prose relies heavily on clichés ("liquid mercury," "stark relief," "second heartbeat") that dull the imagery's impact. The density of abstract nouns ("energy," "resonance," "variables") occasionally obscures the concrete physical action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by cliché similes ("curved like a question mark") and the clumsy, forced phrasing of "sensitively perceptive," which reads as a prompt insertion artifact. These slips disrupt the otherwise solid textural quality.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but marred by clichés ("spun gold," "study in grace") and tautologies ("bioluminescent light," as luminescence implies light). These artifacts, alongside some melodramatic repetition ("knew—knew—"), reduce the line-level impact despite the strong rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on summary and telling ("The negotiations began as they always did"), flattening the scene's momentum. There are noticeable repetitive artifacts (the awkward phrasing of "operatively gentle" appearing twice; multiple references to "celestial bodies") that feel like forced constraints rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has moments of strong imagery ("scattering salt grains like confetti"), but is marred by a noticeable typo ("a impossible chick") and some stock phrasing ("silence pressed in," "language of loss"). The rhythm is generally good, but the reliance on abstract descriptors in key moments dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("decisions hung like icicles... delicate and dangerous") and clichés ("liquid sunshine," "storm on the horizon"). The density of figurative language obscures the action rather than illuminating it.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but relies on some clichés ("motley crew," "piercing the dusk"). The phrase "meteor hush" feels awkward and forced, likely an artifact of prompt insertion that disrupts the semantic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwritten and reliant on clichés ("ghost of its former life," "not with a bang but a whisper," "beating like a heart"). Mixed metaphors ("wings slicing through the sky like a hymn") and abstract descriptors ("map of loss and hope") dilute the imagery. The prompt phrases ("interrupted cadence," "transiently rooted") feel inserted rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric ("glowed faintly, as if remembering sunlight"), though it leans on familiar similes ("like smoke," "like a heartbeat") that dull the impact of the unique magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by clichés and stock metaphors ("time was a river," "voice echoing like wind through leaves," "raindrops clung to her lashes like diamonds"). These artifacts flatten the imagery and reduce the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but relies on standard physical beats ("breath catching," "pulse quickened") and abstract summaries ("dusky harmony"). Redundancies like "bioluminescent light" and "schematic representations" clutter the line-level rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose relies on familiar clichés ("sharp as flint," "soft as moss," "time bending like taffy") and stock physical gestures ("jaw set," "trembling hand"). The writing often tells rather than shows, summarizing emotional states with abstract labels.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("otherworldly glow," "testament to time’s indifference," "slipped through the cracks") and abstract metaphors ("smelled of midnight and memory"). These artifacts obscure the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from frequent clichés ("whispering secrets," "confetti," "silent grief") that flatten the imagery. While grammatically clean, the sentence structures are repetitive, and the reliance on abstract nouns ("determination," "wisdom," "grief") reduces information density and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but relies on clichés such as "breath hitched," "tangled past," and "swallowed by the vastness." The phrase "simply complicated" reads as an oxymoronic label rather than a profound insight. While readable, the line-level craft lacks the freshness and density required for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but marred by the clumsy, verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "carefully resourceful," which reads as an expository tell. Some imagery leans on cliché ("symphony of whispers"), though information density is generally good.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is competent but marred by awkward phrasing ("growl-hiss hybrid") and visible stitching where prompt elements are inserted. Rhythm is frequently disrupted by the need to define terms within dialogue ("Unkindled solace," she murmured).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    The pivotal action beat is opaque: it is unclear how Elara physically "reweaves" the threads of a design on a schematic parchment, creating a significant logic gap in the scene's reality. The phrase "warmly methodical" acts as a told-adverb artifact, and the climax relies on abstract descriptions of light and shifting rooms rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong opening imagery ("fingers traced the frost’s ridges"). However, it occasionally leans on familiar metaphors ("razor-edged thing," "drowning in velvet") that soften the impact of the otherwise sharp sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is marred by severe clichés ("days bled into nights," "stone dropped in a pond," "breadcrumbs") and abstract phrasing. Reliance on summary robs the piece of momentum, and the imagery often confuses rather than clarifies (e.g., a prism splitting sunlight to guide ships at night).

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but suffers from repetitive subject-verb sentence openers ("She descended," "She knelt," "She packed") that create a rote cadence. Phrasing like "preemptively nostalgic" reads as diagnostic label-speak rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.2)
    Technical control is lacking, evidenced by the jarring tense errors and "telling" shortcuts like "moved through ambient awareness." The prose is functional but marred by these artifacts and a tendency toward abstract labeling over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished with a strong rhythmic flow and clear imagery. There are minor overwriting tendencies ("tide’s breath," "pulse of the world"), but line-level mechanics are generally solid and density is adequate.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.0)
    Phrasing is often awkward or redundant. "Intangibly tangible" is a jarring oxymoron used as a clunky modifier for a physical shoot. Constructions like "cut through the moment" and "stretching contracted possibilities" read as forced insertions of prompt vocabulary rather than natural prose.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is overwritten with heavy adjectival stacking ("glass-still," "iridescent quartz," "restless energy") that slows momentum. Key prompt phrases ("catalyze," "vaulting hush") are repeated mechanically, acting as text artifacts rather than organic vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is competent but marred by stock phrases ("time was a thief," "frozen in time," "cathedral of shadows"). These clichés reduce density and prevent the imagery from feeling fresh or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from abstract noun density (oblivion, equilibrium, connection, suffocation) which obscures the physical reality of the scene. Phrases like "loaded emptiness" and "teach suffocating to breathe" read as overwrought artifacts rather than precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear but occasionally overwrought with similes ("sharp as regret") that draw attention to themselves. The text messages function as plot coupons, and the dialogue is largely expository.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.0)
    Line-level craft is hampered by clichés ("liquid gold," "hairs on her arms rise," "crackle like distant thunder") and abstract phrasing ("veil of her ignorance"). Information density is low in the middle section, where the "standing waves" mechanism is explained via exposition rather than action. The prose prioritizes ornamentation over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally vivid but occasionally stumbles into purple territory ("shivering bliss") or awkward phrasing ("summer pave"). The prompt insertions disrupt the rhythm, reading as artifacts rather than organic descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.5)
    Functional prose is marred by physical clichés ("breath catching," "silent tombs," "clattering to the desk"). The phrasing "tactfully hopeful" is an awkward tell that attempts to shortcut emotional nuance with a modifier.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on stock phrases ("steel vultures," "slicing through the dark," "swallow the horizon") and filter verbs ("saw," "felt") that distance the reader. "Auric" and "molten gold" in the opening sentence create an immediate tautology that weakens the hook.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from forced integration of prompt phrases ("vested hush," "quietly vivid certainty") that results in semantic awkwardness. Clichés ("glowing coals," "scattered diamonds") and high adjective density clutter the sentences, reducing narrative momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.3)
    The phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" is a logical and sonic pile-up (a cabochon is a cut stone, a speck is dust; combining them creates confusion). Prompt phrases like "emerged transformed always" and "mossy delight" are pasted in clumsily, disrupting the prose rhythm. Physics are inconsistent; a "dust speck" rolls on bark like a bead.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by clichés ("sharp as knives," "swallowed by") and tell-heavy phrasing. The repeated oxymoron "uncertainly certain" reads as an inserted prompt label rather than organic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by forced prompt insertions ("factually mystical," "Kintsugi intentions") that disrupt rhythm and logic. The reliance on filter verbs ("Kael felt," "Kael understood") and abstract descriptors distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is competent and rhythmically smooth but relies heavily on stock similes ("sharp as knives," "steady drum," "flickering like a flame"). The density of abstract nouns (courage, resolve, grief) over concrete particulars weakens the imagery and impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from mixed metaphors ("metronome set to chaos") and cliché imagery ("shadows shifted like liquid"). The reliance on abstract concepts in the narration occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is polished and functional, with some effective sensory images ("tasted of rust and ocean salt"). However, the writing suffers from a reliance on adjective-heavy description and scaffolded transitions ("Lira’s task was to unfasten..."). The pacing is sluggish due to the lack of narrative drive, and the final paragraph relies on abstract summary rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but suffers from adjectival clutter and the forced repetition of prompt phrases (e.g., "skillfully observant eyes"). The line-level execution feels padded with standard descriptors ("flicker," "cobwebs," "rustle of leaves") rather than fresh, specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is functional but relies on cliché pairings ("terror and wonder") and telling abstractions ("preternatural speed"). The sentence rhythm remains somewhat static during the climax, failing to accelerate to match the destruction described.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant repetitive artifacts mar the prose: "cobalt haze" appears four times, and the specific phrase "burnished sorrow" is used twice, once as a dialogue tag and once in narration. The summary transition ("dispute raged for weeks") disrupts the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no significant line-level errors or artifacts. Some imagery borders on overwrought ("whine that made glass weep," "liquid silence"), but the sensory descriptions generally support the tone. The pacing is well-managed within the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is functional but relies on stock imagery ("shadows stretching like ancient fingers," "prickle of curiosity") that dulls the line-level impact. While the "petrichor" descriptions are evocative, the reliance on explanation during the climax ("defy gravity," "defy explanation") flattens the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by forced phrasing and repetitive sentence structures at the climax (anaphora of &quot;wasn't just... it was...&quot;). The phrase &quot;turbine-hum reverie&quot; appears twice as a clunky noun phrase, disrupting the rhythm and registering as a blatant prompt artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting reduces impact ("pulsed like heartbeats," "equation... in starlight"); summary transitions ("One frigid morning") break momentum and prevent the formation of a cohesive scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies heavily on stock similes and clichés ("black as midnight," "still as a tomb," "blood turned to ice," "mask of familiarity," "twisted like intestines"). These artifacts appear frequently in high-pressure moments, dulling the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies on abstract nouns ("futility," "glory," "purpose") and familiar clichés ("tears mixing with salt spray," "breathe life into the ashes") that dull the imagery. Narrative telling replaces active showing during key transitions, particularly the town's revival.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from moments of clunky telling ("Elder Voss’s motivation was clear") and slightly overwrought modifiers ("velvet disquiet"). These artifacts disrupt the immersive quality of the otherwise strong sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is burdened by a high density of similes (ten "like" or "as" constructions in a short space), creating a repetitive, scaffolded rhythm. Figurative language often obscures rather than clarifies ("texture... gritty like sand... smooth like water"), and "telling" constructions dominate pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from frequent clichés ("pierce the thinnest air," "cut through like a knife," "lost souls"). Phrasing is often functional but lacks density; "credibly curious nature" is a clumsy modifier stack that feels like a prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("tears from the heavens," "velvet expanse") and abstract noun phrases ("fervor of discovery," "flourishing stillness"). Adjective-heavy description slows momentum, and "primal elegance" is repeated as a crutch phrase. The style prioritizes ornamentation over clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is weighed down by cliché clusters ("cracked earth," "baking under a sun," "heart light") and lacks freshness. The insertion of the prompt phrase "contextual clues" creates a jarring tonal artifacts that disrupts the established atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose tends toward the ornate ("sentinel against the twilight," "choreography of decay") and relies on simile over direct action. Clunky expositional bridging ("A fact Elias had deduced...") and the use of "Instantly" to force the climax weaken the line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and figurative language ("silver veins," "pulse with inner light") that slows momentum without adding necessary information. There is a tendency toward "purple" description that obscures the physical reality of the scene in favor of atmosphere. Sentence structures are functional but lack the rhythmic variety needed to build tension during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but heavily reliant on stock phrasing and metaphors ("dappling... in gold," "held their breath," "liquid sun," "shuddered, then stilled"). These clichés flatten the emotional impact of the climax. The summary mode in the final paragraphs reduces information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but overwritten in places, relying on adjective-noun pairings ("dried leaves," "swirling gold") and abstract metaphors ("streaked with... memory"). The "bronze quiet" descriptor is evocative but risks straining the sensory logic.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but reliant on standard phrasings ("twilight seeped," "defied the gloom") and filter structures ("he heard," "he saw") that dilute immediacy. The reliance on summary to explain the bird calls ("told him to dig deeper") bypasses the sensory experience of the connection.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by purple phrasing ("reading the silence," "wind’s whispers") and awkward prompt insertions. The usage of "intuitively descriptive" as a modifier for a physical action and "tinted revelations" in dialogue creates visible text artifacts that disrupt the line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm, though some phrasings tilt toward cliché ("humming down to a whisper," "heart quiet"). The ending leans into abstraction ("willingness to move") rather than trusting the concrete image of the path and compass.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is readable but dense with clichés ("dagger of frost," "heart pounding," "hair stand on end"). The reliance on "telling" for emotional states and the template cadence of the action beats (He did X, then Y happened) sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans into "purple" description and standard similes. The prompt phrase "benevolently ruthless" is inserted somewhat awkwardly ("channeled that ruthlessness") rather than emerging organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("shadows as sharp as knives," "dissolved like smoke," "pain lanced through her," "dust motes... like tiny galaxies"). These artifacts dull the imagery. While clarity is maintained, the density of stock phrasing prevents the writing from reaching a literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is readable and technically clean, but density is lowered by filter verbs ("He saw," "Alaric knew") and some adverbial phrasing ("fidgeted productively"). The rhythm is steady but lacks the propulsion or syntactic variety expected at higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.5)
    Repetitive phrasing (the specific tag "innocently mischievous" is used twice verbatim) and aphoristic dialogue weaken the line-level authority. The prose tells more than it shows, relying on abstract assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose contains several clichés ("whirring like a mechanical heart," "shattered into a thousand... shards") and vague abstractions ("liquid light") that lower information density. The metaphor "eating the air like a thief" is imprecise (thieves steal; acid consumes). The repetition of "between breaths" feels decorative rather than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically functional but marred by clichés ("cracks in his heart," "tide of time") and forced phrasing ("intimately aloof," "intuition humming"). Metaphors often feel decorative rather than clarifying, and the reliance on abstract emotional labels dilutes the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but there is a tendency toward "purple" modifiers and metaphorical density that slows momentum ("dawn bled gold," "bruised sky"). The mechanics of the magic are often told through abstract nouns rather than shown through concrete interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally competent but relies on familiar phrasing ("heart racing," "ink-black sky") and filter verbs ("Mara knew"). The phrase "raw solace" reads as a slightly jarring oxymoron that feels inserted rather than earned by the scene's emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is competent with moments of vivid description, but suffers from cliché phrases ("heart sinking," "words tumbled out") and filter verbs that dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is saturated with cliché similes ("clung like cobwebs," "brittle as moth wings," "rasp like sandpaper," "pale as moonlight") that degrade the imagery. This high density of stock figurative language (simile churn) obscures the unique reality of the scene. The reliance on familiar descriptors prevents the writing from achieving literary specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from adjective stacking and reliance on similes ("brittle as dried leaves," "wavering like heat") that slow momentum. The "emerald shards" and "ghostly figures" are cliché artifacts that reduce the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from severe simile saturation, with nearly every major description relying on a "like X" construction (bruise, dying embers, liquid silver, tiny lanterns, wound, crushed glass, distant thunder, wind chimes). This repetitive syntactic pattern creates a drone that dulls the imagery's impact. Line-level craft needs pruning to allow metaphors to land with more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is readable and technically sound, but it suffers from clichés like "suspended like a moth in amber" and telling-not-showing ("voice scientifically romantic"). The use of adjectives is occasionally dense ("jagged, dancing silhouettes"), slowing momentum without adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by a high density of clichés ("green-eyed monster," "bruised purples," "bones to lead") and purple phrasing. "Feral nostalgia" is repeated as a fixed phrase, creating a lexical loop. The reliance on abstract metaphors ("jumbled tapestry," "specter of smoke") obscures the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but the reliance on the illogical "file" discovery creates a jarring narrative artifact. The text occasionally overwrites simple actions with heavy metaphor ("vessel of fear, pride, and relief").

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically competent, though simile-dense ("like spilled milk," "like liquid starlight," "like a heartbeat"). While the imagery is pretty, the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum. Mechanics are clean, with no major stumbling blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing ("hummed with the hush") and worn clichés ("eyes two bruises," "prismatic shards"). The description of the climax ("glow brightening until it blinded") lacks the fresh, specific imagery found in the setting details, reducing the impact of the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from abstract noun density ("lore," "unification," "arbitration") and stock imagery ("drifted like clouds"). Phrases like "resounding hush" hover between poetic and contradictory without grounding the sensory experience in concrete specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is high-quality with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("stars themselves were debating," "clung... like a barnacle"). The countdown structure is used without becoming repetitive scaffold, and the density of image-to-word count is high, supporting the story's compact scope.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.8)
    Line-level execution is marred by repetitive phrasing ("fractal patterns," "fractal shadows," "laser pointer button") and mixed metaphors. Technical descriptions dissolve into nonsensical abstraction ("adjusting its frequency to match the vibrations of Lira’s voice"), undermining the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on some workshop clichés ("rain tapped a Morse code," "smelled of... old regrets"). These abstractions and familiar metaphors flatten the texture of otherwise solid descriptive writing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is mechanically competent but marred by purple phrasing ("melodically haunted souls") and cliché constructions ("frayed at the edges," "recipe for grief: sugar, flour, time"). These artifacts reduce information density and replace specific observation with generic "writerly" signals.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished with a consistent rhythm, though it occasionally relies on familiar literary metaphors ("bruise of violets"). The density of filter verbs separates the reader from the immediate sensory experience, dampening the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but dense with adjectival clutter and stock metaphors ("eyes sharp as glass shards," "shadows that danced like dervishes"). There is a tendency toward overwriting that slows momentum without adding necessary information or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but cluttered with abstract nouns ("joy," "sorrow," "longing"). A noticeable echo occurs with "time pooled like mercury" (para 2) and "time pooled like liquid" (para 8), revealing a limited imagistic palette.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished with some strong descriptive beats ("prickled Elias’s skin"). However, the dialogue leans into abstraction and "told" emotion ("guilt gnawed at him") rather than showing these states through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose is overwritten, prioritizing purple phrasing ("symphony of stillness," "weeping and laughing") over concrete detail. There is a high density of abstract nouns and filter verbs that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("tears streaming," "unblinking eye") and the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("volcanic tenderness") as expository telling. The line-level work tells rather than shows key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with abstract metaphors ("hush of the universe inhaling," "velvet silence") that obscure the scene. Adjectival stacking reduces immediacy, and the reliance on "telling" emotions ("cerulean for joy") flattens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and readable with some strong imagery ("creases sharp as knife cuts"), though it occasionally leans on clichés ("tasted like ozone"). The pacing is steady, but the climax lacks the rhythmic acceleration needed to convey urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from tautology ("bruised sky like a bruise on glass") and a high density of "telling" artifacts where emotions and concepts are labeled rather than shown. Clichés ("rough as gravel," "twin moons") dilute the specific imagery of the mirror and shutters. The reliance on meta-commentary ("The core concept of silent empathy...") disrupts narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but occasionally overwritten with adjective-heavy descriptions ("mist-swirled aisles," "shimmered like starlight"). The phrase "unspoken words" repeats frequently, becoming a lexical artifact. Line-level momentum is generally maintained, though the summary beat stalls the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies on a high density of clichés ("eyes like moonlit pools," "heart pounding," "weight of the past lifted") and mixed metaphors ("shockwave of clarity"). These artifacts dilute the imagery and reduce the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery ("weathered to the color of old bone"), though it occasionally veers into overwriting ("fractured shards of light"). The rhythm is steady, mirroring the carving process. A major weakness is the reliance on aphoristic sentences that tell the reader how to feel rather than letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose relies on clichés ("silence so thick it could be touched") and repeats key phrases ("tremor of certainty," "lantern-moth hush") within a short space, reducing their impact. The density is high in imagery but low in narrative information.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("mechanism clicked like a cricket’s legs"). However, some moments veer into purple prose ("erupted in hues," "chorus of wind chimes") or rely on filter verbs that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is competent but frequently overwritten, relying on adjectival stacking ("iridescent threads," "dim light," "whisper") that slows momentum. Line-level craft prioritizes poetic posturing over causal clarity, with several "telling" summaries of emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("shadow of his former self," "rock bottom," "glimmer of hope," "burning certainty"). While grammatically clean, the reliance on stock phrases dampens the emotional impact and originality of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on dense adjective-noun pairings ("rain-beaded skylight," "onyx-inked cards," "silver serpent," "inverted hourglasses") that slow momentum. While grammatically clean, the density of figurative language in the dialogue and narration creates an ornamental barrier to immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and strained metaphors ("clung to ruins like lichen," "fear was a palpable thing"). Key phrases from the prompt ("atoms of nostalgia," "anguished joy") are repeated awkwardly, and the density of adjectives slows the momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing creates distracting artifacts (e.g., the specific phrase "sharp eyes" appears four times). Descriptors often lean into abstraction ("luminous with regret") rather than concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.0)
    Significant overwriting and simile density stifle the prose ("creaking like a hinge in time," "like a ghost's breath," "slicing... like glass," "ripple like a promise"). These abstract comparisons obscure the physical reality of the scene. The "hinge in time" metaphor is particularly mixed and ineffective.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is generally functional but suffers from clunky, expository phrasing like "her mind accidentally telepathic." Several metaphors feel strained or purely ornamental ("displaced miracle trapped between moments"). There is a reliance on telling ("She’d always believed...") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from frequent clichés ("ache in her chest," "tears pricking," "throat tightened") and heavy-handed personification ("building itself sighed," "building itself approved"). The phrase "hushed thunder" reads as a confused oxymoron rather than a fresh image, and the reliance on pathetic fallacy weakens the line-level reality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose is weighed down by purple overwriting ("eyes like fractured galaxies," "breath of imprisoned gods") and clichés ("hues that made poets weep"). The density of figurative language obscures the action rather than illuminating it, violating the efficiency standard.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically sound, with strong density in descriptions like "librarian of lost fire." However, the reliance on some standard similes ("pulsed like a heartbeat," "shimmered like a soap bubble") prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the imagery is competent, the prose suffers from a repetitive "not X, but Y" syntactical formula (used five times) to deliver insights. This rhetorical crutch flattens the revelations and makes the narrative rhythm predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose suffers from repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("shoreline lullaby" appears three times; "gently persistent" twice), which breaks immersion and feels mechanical. While the sentence rhythm is generally smooth, the reliance on these specific labels as crutches for description indicates a lack of line-level invention.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors and overwriting ("woven from moonlight," "voice a razor," "wound upward like a question mark"). While grammatically competent, the high density of "purple" descriptors and poetic artifacts obscures clarity and slows momentum, drawing attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is functional but laden with adjective-heavy clichés ("slow poison," "sharp as..."). The specific phrase "iron gall ink pellet" is repeated clumsily. The object continuity error (using the key to open the door, then throwing it without retrieval) disrupts the line-level logic of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from cliché ("gnawed by time," "bones in a graveyard") and overly literal imagery (plankton spelling numbers). The rhythm is generally good, but the "tapping" motif borders on twee in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is weighed down by pervasive clichés ("liquid gold," "sharp as knives," "world held its breath") that dull the imagery. Sentence-level craft is functional but lacks freshness, relying on stock descriptors for emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("steamed like a cauldron," "like a wounded bird") and filter verbs ("she saw it," "she heard") that dilute the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent and grammatically sound, but suffers from cliché ("world shattered," "crumpled photograph," "void") and "therapy-speak" artifacts. The reliance on abstract nouns to describe emotional states ("resilience," "chaos," "grief") reduces the density of concrete imagery in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like a tired heartbeat," "like a moth," "like shattered mirrors," "like a bridge") which dilute the imagery. Clichés ("shattered mirrors," "ribs ache") and "as if" constructions ("as if alive," "as if charged") reduce immediacy and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but relies on adjectival stuffing and sensory clichés. The phrasing "consciously wild intuition snapping into focus" creates a jarring semantic artifact that mars the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is marred by purple metaphors ("cracking like a whispered secret") and clunky "tell" phrases that summarize emotional states instead of showing them. The prompt phrases are shoehorned into sentences in ways that damage syntax and logic (e.g., "bravely conflicted heart"). Repetitive sentence structures and filter verbs ("she knew," "she could hear") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but leans toward purple ("symphony of containment," "fractured starlight") and abstract phrasing ("inculcate plants with values") that slows momentum. Line-level rhythm is steady, but the density of adjectives reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from repetitive phrasing, specifically the triple use of "zigzag" which feels like a forced insertion of the prompt rather than organic description. Additionally, phrases like "emotions too complex for mortal minds" lean into cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is cluttered with stock phrases ("breath hitched," "spidery handwriting," "changes everything") and awkward metaphors. High density of clichés prevents the imagery from feeling fresh or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by the clumsy integration of prompt phrases ("found in antique furniture") that disrupts narrative logic. The reliance on familiar lyrical tropes ("etched into her identity") flattens the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.0)
    The writing is polished but leans toward purple prose ("ephemeral galaxies," "lilac unease"). The density of adjectives slows momentum, though the mechanics are generally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from significant reliance on clichés ("smile like the first light of dawn," "blade without a hilt") and repetitive phrasing ("warm coldness" and "cradle empathy" both appear twice). The awkward insertion of prompt phrases into dialogue disrupts the rhythm and naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is overwritten, relying heavily on synesthetic mixed metaphors ("voice a ripple of lavender and cello") that confuse rather than illuminate. Frequent use of clichés ("bled together like watercolors") and abstract-concrete pairings ("scent of... forgotten melodies") creates a dense, purple texture that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("fractally precise" twice, "willowglass hope" twice), creating a sense of synonym churn. The montage section ("Over the next week") flattens the rhythm, shifting from immediate scene texture to summary telling.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from somatic clichés ("breath caught," "throat tightened") and awkward hyphenated concepts ("after-humans-hibernate"); sentence structures are repetitive, often cycling through simple Subject-Verb patterns without rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from the visible pasting of prompt phrases ("unearthed silence," "quietly inspired," "raw possibility"), which appear verbatim multiple times, creating a repetitive scaffold effect. These insertions disrupt the rhythm and feel artificial compared to the surrounding text.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from purple phrasing ("frost-kissed gravel," "mist clinging... like a second skin") and awkward prompt insertions ("Prudently daring" as a modifier). "Vouchsafe" is used in a grammatically functional but logically strained context.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by abstract jargon and "told" significance ("unraveling threads of meaning"). Logical contradictions in the timeline (the rain gutter sequence) obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery; lines like "chimney smoke flattened against the horizon" show strong control of rhythm and visual precision. The writing avoids major artifacts and maintains momentum, effectively balancing the abstract concepts with concrete nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by the clumsy repetition of the prompt phrase "with the rhythm of oars in water" and abstract descriptors. The density of "told" emotion and label-like phrasing ("protected vulnerability") drags down line-level quality and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and technically clean, but relies heavily on simile ("like liquid starlight," "like smoke," "like wings") which dilutes immediacy. The pacing is smooth but lacks the varied sentence structures needed to build genuine tension during the climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies on physical clichés ("chest tightened," "tears pricking," "strange warmth") and abstract metaphors ("liquid light"). The repetition of the phrase "prismatic quiet" in the second and final paragraphs creates an unearned lexical loop.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by cliché clusters like "thinly veiled," "gravelly whisper," and "loyal beast." The description of the resolution ("sound like wind chimes made of starlight") tilts into purple prose that clashes with the otherwise technical tone of the station.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is saturated with clichés ("heart pounding," "tantalizingly close," "into the unknown," "living thing") that deaden the impact. The phrasing often feels like filler rather than precise description.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but dense with cliché similes ("scattered like ash," "glowing like a vein of blood"). The reliance on abstract nouns and overwrought imagery distances the reader from the immediate physical action, creating a texture that feels manufactured rather than observed.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level craft is weakened by summary-heavy telling ("spent hours," "fragmented") and noticeable word echoes ("margins," "nervously confident"). The prose scaffolds the plot rather than immersing the reader in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("clung to the air like a memory") and a reliance on filter verbs ("He understood") that distance the reader. The pacing is sluggish due to the immediate explanation of mysteries through exposition rather than action, preventing narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("swallowed by ivy," "frozen in time," "snake eating its tail") and purple abstractions ("scent of... forgotten dreams"). The forced repetition of "dusky harmony" and "perceptively calm" creates artifact drag rather than resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery, though it occasionally leans into familiar poetic tropes ("tide finding its shore," "melted silver"). There are no major mechanical errors or loops. The "daylily-pressed telegram" is a nice textural detail, though the prose sometimes prioritizes ornamentation over directness in high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is mechanically sound but dense with adjectival modifiers and familiar metaphors ("frayed like old rope," "writhing like serpents"). There is a tendency to "tell" emotional states ("Mira’s chest tightened") rather than evoking them through fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level craft is marred by "telling" emotions ("anxious elation") and repetitive sentence structures (Name + Verb) that stall momentum. Clichéd similes ("pooled like spilled ink") and abstract phrasing weaken the vividness of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but relies on familiar metaphors ("tapestry of her life," "threads of understanding"). Line-level craft is functional, though the "recontextualization of trauma" ending is summarized rather than felt. There are no major mechanical errors, but the density of thought-terminating clichés in the finale reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by clichés (“balm against his heart,” “drowned his sorrows”) and abstract phrasing (“smelled of... regret”). Several metaphors feel strained or familiar, and the “crashed like quarry dynamite” simile violates physical logic (dynamite explodes, it doesn’t crash).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is competent and clear, with some strong imagery ("iron roots coiled"), but suffers from abstract noun usage and a lack of sentence-level propulsion. The reliance on summary in the final third ("Days later") flattens the narrative energy at the crucial resolution point.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but suffers from a "gear" loop, where the automaton's gears whir, spin, or adjust in nearly every paragraph as a gestural crutch. The high density of imagery slows momentum without adding causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is polished rhythmically but suffers from "purple" artifacts and cliché imagery ("frozen tears," "light that wasn't light"). There is a high density of abstract emotional nouns ("ache of unspoken truths") that distances the reader from the visceral reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished with good rhythm and sensory density. However, reliance on abstract metaphors ("stagnant pool," "festering") and the on-the-nose graffiti text creates a didactic texture. No major technical slips, but the metaphorical weight sometimes slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from "telling" artifacts (e.g., "Her motivation was clear," "Lira’s cautious exuberance grew"), using labels instead of evoked sensation. Clichéd phrasing ("racing heart," "storm on the horizon") and scaffold sentences dilute the information density and narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    While competent and rhythmically sound, the prose relies heavily on stock metaphors and clichés ("liquid moonlight," "tasted like ash," "swirling like a tiny galaxy"). These "purple" artifacts diminish the freshness of the imagery and would likely flag in a top-tier literary submission context. Specificity is sometimes sacrificed for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but suffers from adjective stacking ("silver spectacles," "green-gold glow"). The rhyming job title "beautician mortician" clashes slightly with the otherwise serious, reverent tone.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is laden with filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") and clunky metaphors ("scalloping their edges"). The prompt insertion "vineyard hush" creates a mixed metaphor (vineyards in a grotto?) that disrupts the logic of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent but cluttered with modifier stacks (e.g., "sincerely insincere and calculatedly casual") and stage-direction dialogue tags ("said, her voice fraying"). These artifacts slow the rhythm and tell emotions that should be shown.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is competent but laden with adjective-heavy description ("cool, moss-slick," "smooth, obsidian") that slows momentum. The required long phrase is inserted twice—once as a simile and once as the closing line—creating a repetitive, clunky rhythm that draws attention to itself as a prompt artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is functional and rhythmic but cluttered with abstract nouns and repetitive phrasing of the prompt elements ("pulse left wandering"). Clichés like "skeletal fingers" and "bruised sky" detract from the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is competent but laden with clichés ("pierced the clouds," "heartbeat," "tears freezing on his cheeks"). The phrase "brilliant dimness" reads as a forced oxymoron rather than a precise image. There is a lack of density, with sentences often serving only to move the puppet-like character to the next plot point.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant unintentional repetition of specific phrases ("wandered purposefully" in paras 1 and 4; "meteor hush" in paras 1 and 7) creates a noticeable scaffold artifact. The prose struggles with modifier density ("soft, flickering gold," "low, resonant hum") that slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("pooled like honey," "clung like stardust") and abstract nouns that crowd out concrete detail. Metaphors are often mixed or decorative ("symphony of light and intent") rather than clarifying.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by standard phrasing and "He [verb]" sentence structures that create a repetitive cadence. The "crystallized then" moment tells rather than shows a pivotal internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on some stock phrasing ("blush of dawn," "flickering like a candle") that diminishes freshness. The repetition of the phrase "earnestly naive" (required element) feels mechanical in execution, drawing attention to the prompt rather than the character.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm and imagery. "Precisely humane" and "mirrored hush" feel slightly inserted to meet prompt requirements but are woven in syntactically. There are no major technical stumbles, though the daughter's dialogue drags the register toward the melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, dense with adjectives and "purple" descriptors ("glinting like trapped starlight," "living mosaic"). Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") distance the reader from the immediate experience. The reliance on clichés ("slicing the air," "held its breath") weakens the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by repetition (the oxymoron "soundless echo" appears twice) and clunky adjectival phrasing ("attentively inventive"). The technical explanation of the buckle's function feels like expository scaffolding showing through the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by cliché similes ("like sugar in tea," "like a knife through butter") and purple descriptors. The density of familiar metaphors flattens the emotional impact of the "ego death" and combat sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by awkward phrasing to accommodate constraints ("flow through orthogonal approaches") and the repetition of the distinct phrase "storm-born silence" in a short space. These artifacts, along with some slightly purple descriptions, distract from the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.7)
    Significant repetition of full phrases ("pull cord handle" ×4, "macerate the air" ×3, "mournfully eager" ×2) disrupts the prose rhythm and suggests a lack of lexical control. These loop artifacts create a mechanical feel that undermines the intended lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is solid with some strong imagery ("shed mist like a snakeskin"). The pacing flows well, though phrasing like "interiorizing exteriors" reads a bit jargon-heavy within the prose. Minor spatial confusion in the climax (the fountain's depth/state) drags the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from purple patches ("pulsed like a wounded heart," "sponge soaking up poison") and the aforementioned repetitive idiom. Line-level propulsion is functional, but the reliance on clichés and "tell-y" interiority ("Kael’s stoically sensitive nature") drags down the craft quality.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose flows with momentum but is marred by cliché imagery ("skeletal hand," "gorge yawned") and some repetitive phrasing of the prompt attribute. The reliance on "In that instant" constructions to bridge cause and effect weakens the line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is competent and descriptive but suffers from adjective stacking and a significant repetitive artifact: the phrase "resiliently positive [noun]" is used as a template three times. This redundancy flattens the rhythm and reads as a mechanical insertion rather than organic craft.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is competent but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and stock metaphors ("eyes like fractured prisms," "liquid fractals," "spider’s silk"). Abstract nouns clutter the sentences ("chaos of perception," "rational enchantment"), reducing narrative drive. There are no major mechanical errors, but the density of flowery descriptors slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level mechanics are generally competent but marred by "telling" artifacts, such as the filter stack "felt a somber marvel wash over her." The awkward phrasing "balancedly curious" disrupts the prose rhythm and reads as a forced prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is overwritten with dense, clashing metaphors ("spectral cats," "bruised violet," "trapped in amber") that obscure clarity. Narrative filtering ("Lila’s persistently curious mind noticed") creates distance, telling the reader how to interpret the character's attention.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    A high density of clichés ("impossible angles," "whirred to life," "tears blurred her vision") flattens the prose. The oxymoron "crashing hush" is repeated awkwardly, and the staging relies on stock descriptors rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is dense with simile and metaphor, sometimes to the point of opacity ("windows hummed with the ghost of starlight," "nib still clogged with her last words"). While rhythmic, the high concentration of figurative language occasionally stalls momentum and distances the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is weighed down by simile clutter and register clashes, such as mixing mythic bone imagery with "fractal symmetry" and "mathematics." The density of figurative language obscures the action rather than heightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    Momentum is generally good, but the prose suffers from mixed metaphors and abstractions (e.g., "metallic tang of secrets," "frostbitten hope curdling"). These overwritten flourishes distract from the scene's concrete imagery and weaken the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is competent but overcrowded with similes and adjective-noun pairings that slow momentum ("trembled like moth wings," "weeping sap"). Key images, like "liquid starlight," feel cliché and lack the freshness required for the highest tier. The density of figurative language in high-pressure beats obscures the action rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and high metaphor density ("twilight’s bruise," "veins pulsing like a wound," "curdled into silence") which obscures clarity. These ornamental artifacts slow momentum without adding precision to the image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("broken toy," "mouse’s whispers") and mixed metaphor ("Inside the chime... time stretched"). Repetitive phrasing ("misting hush" appears three times) and adjective-heavy description stall momentum. The writing draws attention to its own performance rather than the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but laden with stock pairings ("tattered silk," "soft hum") and sentimental phrasing ("tears welled"). The density of predictable adjective-noun constructions slows momentum without adding fresh texture or density.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density ("origami time," "bleeding gold," "liquid glow" in close proximity), which obscures clarity. Clichéd phrasing in the peak beats ("burst of radiance," "air hummed") weakens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by cliché ("eyes burned with a quiet intensity") and adjective-heavy descriptors. The mandatory phrases ("unassumingly bold," "hush of cosmic possibility") are inserted stiffly, creating a checklist feel rather than organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent and moves with reasonable momentum, though it occasionally relies on abstract phrasing ("crisp nostalgia") that blurs sensory immediacy. Sentence rhythm is varied, but the reliance on "body part + verb" constructions (hands trembled, breath hitched) borders on stock physical cues. No major technical errors, but the style lacks a sharp, unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by forced phrasing to fit prompt elements ("mentored resilience quietly," "combative tenderness"). These insertions read as artifacts rather than natural descriptors, creating clunky rhythms.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.1)
    Mechanically clean and rhythmic, but the prose suffers from cliché density ("liquid gold," "frothy white," "liquid rainbows"). Adjectives are frequent and often standard, reducing the freshness of the imagery. The flow is smooth, but the texture lacks specific, surprising observations.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is mechanically functional but weakened by frequent filter verbs ("Mara realized," "She felt") and lazy transitions ("Suddenly"), lacking rhythmic propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with sensory imagery ("faces eroded by centuries," "flickering light"). Minor repetition of descriptors (e.g., "jagged" appears in multiple contexts) and a reliance on adjective-noun pairings slightly dampens the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but line-level logic errors (salt crusting in liquid water) undermine the craft. Scientific terms like "wavefunction collapse" feel decorative rather than operational, clashing with the fantastical logic of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases creates a "Mad Libs" texture; the full phrase "flower press bolt plate" appears four times in under 500 words, destroying rhythm. "Tinkersong wonder" and "driftingly alert" are also repeated, making the scaffolding highly visible. The prose prioritizes flowery description over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of cliché "X like Y" similes ("gears grinding like a tired heart," "grief like a second skin," "swirling like storm clouds"). This repetitive sentence structure and reliance on stock imagery flattens the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished, but the integration of required phrases creates abstraction artifacts (e.g., "dusty starlight of belief"). Some metaphors ("fractals of rage") clash slightly with the prevailing atmospheric imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("spines faded," "etched in light"). However, the logical disconnect regarding the passage of time (shadows lengthening to midnight to dawn) creates friction that smooth sentences cannot fully mask.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose flows but suffers from overwrought metaphors ("slanting like a storm front") and "screaming" birds. Crucially, the climax is delivered via abstract summary ("Images flooded her mind") rather than concrete, dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional but overly adjectival ("hauntingly bright," "faint blush"), creating a dense, slightly sluggish rhythm. The clunky integration of the prompt phrase disrupts the otherwise stable flow.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is heavily adjectival and relies on telling over showing ("Elara’s motivation was clear," "brambled hope was palpable"). The pacing is sluggish due to the summary mode, and the phrase "brambled hope" reads as an awkward forceful insertion of a prompt element.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is marred by significant clichés, starting with "scars like a badge of honor" in the opening sentence and "insects in amber" shortly after. The central metaphor ("cracks that let the light in") is a recognizable lift that undermines the story's literary authority.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is functional and rhythmic but relies heavily on stock similes ("twisted like veins," "sap like blood," "unblinking intelligence") that dull the imagery's impact. The phrasing of the constraint ("leave impressions without touching: arrange stones") creates a syntactic logic bump that momentarily obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition of phrases ("As the pieces fell into place," "loosened grief") creates a scaffold/loop artifact. The prose occasionally drifts into cliché ("insight flickered," "surging force") and heavy-handed metaphor, disrupting the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level mechanics are generally clean, but the repetition of the prompt phrase "glimmering parole" (three times) becomes distracting. The prose tends toward adjectival stacking ("mindfully scattered," "clean slate vendor") that clutters the rhythm without adding density.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong imagery ("spires glinting like frozen seafoam," "sandpaper rough memories") propelling the narrative. There is a slight tendency toward labeling ("emotionally contagious nature") where showing the effect might have been sharper, but the rhythm and density generally hold up well. The final paragraph effectively utilizes the prompt phrase without disrupting the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is technically functional but suffers from "purple" overwriting (e.g., "shadows that danced like restless spirits," "flame guttering like a breath held in suspense"). These metaphors clutter the line level without adding specific clarity, and the reliance on abstract descriptors ("vigorous tenderness") weakens the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant overwriting and cliché density hinder the prose ("liquid mercury," "shattered constellations," "taste of defeat like ash," "liquid light"). These artifacts appear frequently, including in peak beats, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over clarity and sensory freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional but marred by overwriting and cliché (e.g., mist swirling "like living things," "defy the land’s own bones"). The phrase "clandestinely luminous" is an awkward modifier stack. Sentence rhythm becomes repetitive in the middle section (She stepped... She reached... She traced...).

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is serviceable but marred by the redundant "symphonically minded mind" and several clichés ("soft as a heartbeat, loud as a promise"). The description relies on standard poetic antithesis rather than fresh, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by "telling" emotions ("hopeful melancholy warming his chest") and repetitive sentence structures. The phrase "hologram of sorts" is a significant register slip that flattens the magical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose suffers from semantic errors ("hands intuitively descriptive") and melodramatic phrasing ("static of unspoken things"). The reliance on abstract nouns and passive constructions ("motivation was not curiosity") drains momentum and clarity from the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.2)
    The awkward verb "journalized" is repeated four times, creating a significant text artifact. Phrasing is often redundant ("olfactorily sensitive nose") or adjective-heavy, stalling narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("coiled like serpents") and repetitive vocabulary ("gravity" appears frequently). The contradiction between "whirling silence" and the "hum of overstimulated plants" creates sensory confusion rather than atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, but marred by stock phrasing ("settled like a second skin," "aligned—too perfectly"). The "dropped breadcrumbs" simile is slightly mixed (debris suggests chaos; breadcrumbs suggest a path), but the overall line-level craft is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is technically competent but saturated with dense figurative language ("frost spiraled like ghostly breath") that slows momentum. This overwriting creates a "generated" feel, prioritizing ornamentation over clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    A significant subject-verb agreement error in the opening sentence ("Kael uncase") undermines immediate trust. The prose relies heavily on stock similes ("like a needle through silk," "like a blade," "like liquid"), reducing textual freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level mechanics are generally clean, with some strong imagery ("sorrow of a sunset is a comma in the dark"). However, the piece relies on cliché constructions ("kaleidoscope of memories," "symphony of hues") that dull the impact of the climax. The pacing is effective, though the density of adjectives sometimes slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is competent with some nice imagery ("stones slick with frost"), but suffers from occasional cliché ("spectral hand"). The pacing is steady, though the reliance on adjectives slows the momentum in places.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from significant cliché density ("eyes the color of storm clouds," "absorbed them like a sponge," "sickening lurch"). These stock phrases, particularly at the character introduction and the climax, flatten the emotional impact and reduce the work's literary distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the prose has momentum, it relies frequently on stock imagery ("liquid gold," "hitting her like a physical blow," "blind and pure"). These clichés flatten the emotional impact of key beats. The rhythm is competent, but the lack of fresh metaphorical language in high-pressure moments limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is competent but repetitive (overuse of "quiet") and reliant on adjectival stacking ("shimmering, iridescent fabric"). Several clichés ("skeletal hand," "ancient ribcages") and purple flourishes flatten the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by a significant semantic error in the final paragraph: "He smiled, cyclically spontaneous, and walked away." This usage converts a complex modifier into a nonsensical adverbial phrase, disrupting the reading flow and signaling a forced prompt adherence. Elsewhere, the prose leans on standard descriptors ("loomed," "shuddered") without distinct stylistic flair.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.5)
    While grammatically polished, the prose relies heavily on received phrases and clichés ("sputtered and died," "ghostly moan," "gathering gloom," "feeble glow"). These stock descriptors reduce the vividness of the imagery. The line-level execution is smooth but lacks the friction of fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose leans toward purple ("liquid night," "restless gods") and clichés ("thick and oily"). The register drift ("Let's do this") disrupts the line-level texture. While there are moments of clarity, the reliance on adjectival intensity over concrete action lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm is smooth, but the prose leans on stock phrasing ("moths to a flame," "stolen secret," "invisible threads") and expository transitions. The density of "told" realizations in the final third reduces the immediate impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is functional but marred by purple descriptors ("celestial heartbeat," "moon, full and swollen") and reliance on clichés ("hairs on his neck stood up"). The repetition of the phrase "mundane miracle" and the expository nature of the "Sorrow, he'd learned" paragraph stall momentum, prioritizing explanation over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with adjectival density and abstract metaphors ("time pooled like mercury," "shadows had their own language"). Frequent use of cliché pairings ("molten gold") and poetic abstraction obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.9)
    Cliché density is high in pivotal moments ("voice like gravel," "tears prickled," "wrapped around her like a cloak"), which blunts emotional impact. While grammatically clean, the prose lacks freshness, relying on stock imagery to carry the weight of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mechanically sound, but the prose leans toward "workshop purple" with phrases like "liminal space" and "fragile thread." The integration of required phrases is sometimes clumsy, creating semantic bumps that disrupt the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose contains strong images but is marred by expository scaffolding ("This was her method") and cliché phrasing ("frustration gnawed," "just out of reach"). The reliance on telling the reader what is happening rather than dramatizing the experience drags down the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose maintains momentum and clarity with no major technical errors. Some imagery is cliché ("Dawn bled," "scattering like roaches"), and the final sentence relies on a "tell" ("comforting unease") rather than letting the image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent and descriptive but suffers from adjective stacking and slightly clichéd imagery ("trembling like the wings of a thousand moths"). The rhythm is generally smooth, though the dialogue feels functionally expository rather than natural to the characters' voices.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("festered like a wound," "ghost of his younger self," "mouth mid-scream") and adjective-noun pairings that dilute momentum. The phrase "auroral sorrow" appears as a forced insertion rather than an organic description of the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("shimmered like poisoned honey," "swirling mist"). Sentence rhythm is generally good, though the dialogue in the finale feels slightly stilted to accommodate the prompt phrase. No significant artifacts or loops, though "repurposed how?" is a standard expository setup.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is heavily overwritten with "purple" modifiers and strained metaphors ("liquid light," "stones hum," "air shimmered with secrets"). These empty intensifiers obscure concrete action, and the reliance on abstract nouns ("wonder," "truth") flattens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but relies on familiar phrasings and clichés ("creaking like old hinges," "inexorable drift," "licked the edges"). The metaphor of "static" is overused, and the description of the "orb" drifts into vague abstraction ("harsh and soothing") rather than concrete specificity. The rhythm is readable but lacks propulsion in the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies on clichés ("pulse quickened," "mind racing," "tears filled her eyes") and abstract summaries ("vibrant mosaic"). The pacing is sluggish, halted by exposition dumps, and the climax is rushed through a summary of the letters rather than dramatized engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is competent, but mixed metaphors and cliché phrasing ("snapping like Morse code") reduce clarity. The "humbled" drones anthropomorphism breaks the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by significant cliché artifacts ("fabric of reality," "flood of memories," "trembling hands," "swirling vortex"). These stock phrases reduce the immediacy and freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from forced integration of prompt phrases, resulting in awkward constructions ("hummed with the smoothed hush"). Abstract modifiers clutter sentences ("fractured constellations," "unspoken truths"), reducing distinctness and momentum. The density of purple prose artifacts obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but the emotional peaks rely on distinct clichés ("breath caught," "chill ran down his spine") that flatten the impact. These stock reactions undermine the otherwise solid atmospheric description and trigger artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("sibilant hiss," "trick of the light," "pooled like ink") and adjectival padding. A significant register drift occurs with the insertion of the technobabble phrase "resonance structures" into a lyrical fantasy context, disrupting the line-level texture.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but overwrought, relying on "purple" metaphors (stalactites as "liquid time") and standard similes ("thick as velvet") that dull the imagery. The density of modifiers slows momentum without always adding necessary precision or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is readable but dense with abstract nouns and "tell" phrases that obscure immediate action. The insertion of the prompt phrase "progressive disclosure" disrupts the narrative flow and feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.4)
    The middle section relies on a repetitive scaffold ("The first dream...", "The second dream...", "The third dream...") that kills momentum and reads like an outline. While the grammar is clean, the prose depends on clichés and abstract summaries rather than concrete, immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose rhythm is competent but marred by repetitive imagery—"liquid silver" and "liquid light" appear in close proximity alongside "silver threads." Reliance on abstract personification ("silence beneath the song") and filter verbs ("He frowned, squinting") dilutes the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by modifier-heavy phrasing and clichés like "intuition screamed," "snapped into focus," and "miniature suns." Mixed metaphors ("branches unfurling like sighs") detract from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, suffering from "purple prose" density with clashing metaphors ("clawed," "fingers," "unfold like origami," "circuit board"). Key phrases from the prompt ("Across the rise of a prophet") are shoehorned in with awkward grammar that disrupts the reading flow. The reliance on adjectives and abstract nouns obscures the action and reduces narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is often purple ("orchestra of ghosts," "lonesome splendor") and overly adjective-heavy. The inclusion of drafting artifacts (parenthetical edits, word count notes) indicates a lack of polish and severely harms the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by "purple" descriptors ("bled tangerine") and awkward prompt insertions ("vibrations pulsed... logically emotional"). These artifacts disrupt immersion and reduce line-level authority and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.4)
    While imagery is strong, the prose suffers from a repetitive "not X, but Y" rhetorical loop (used five times), creating a template cadence that dulls the rhythm. This artifact highlights the story's didactic nature and reduces line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("smooth as oil," "heart racing," "cold, hard facts") that dull the impact. The repetition of "reverberated" (a prompt requirement) feels mechanical, and the sentence rhythm lacks the variation needed for a high-tension scene.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is competent but marred by awkward prompt-forced phrasing ("in the calm before realization") and some overwriting. The rhythm is functional but lacks the density or propulsion expected at a higher level.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is functional but marred by occasional "telling" of emotion ("irreverent awe blooming") and clunky adverbial phrasing ("transliterated wildly"). While the imagery of gears and acid is strong, the line-level execution sometimes prioritizes prompt integration over rhythmic flow or precision.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but laden with clichés ("shadowy figure," "pulse quickening"). The forced repetition of specific phrases ("brightly attentive," "sensed absence") creates noticeable text artifacts that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is weighed down by weak adverb-adjective pairings ("calmly intuitive," "softly," "shadow-laced") and abstract telling. The non-sequitur inclusion of the "reply" line creates a jarring logical artifact that disrupts the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished ("breath fogging the air"), but the "parasol tip" mechanics create a jarring logical artifact in the climax that no amount of smooth syntax can hide. The phrase "fold in patience" is used effectively as a refrain but is defined too explicitly at the end, reducing its poetic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but relies on clichés ("bruised with the promise of rain," "laugh like wind chimes") and abstract scaffolding. The density of fresh observation is moderate, and the academic phrasing in the exposition drags the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.6)
    Sentence structure is repetitive, frequently relying on Subject-Verb openers ("The prophet arrived," "Mara stood," "The pavilion... hummed," "The kinetic parapet... shuddered"). Prose artifacts include "coiling like smoke" and "shuddered... a silent salute," which feel like stock phrasing. The rhythm is monotonous, mirroring the lack of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from adverb-adjective stacking ("perceptively calm gaze") and cliché metaphors ("ghosts of machinery," "green fingers feeling for the sky"). Abstract nouns replace concrete details, and the "scent of memory" line is a significant artifact of overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("clung... like a second skin," "silent sentinel," "time moved differently"). The misuse of "sonically reflective" to describe an object interacting with light is a significant semantic error that breaks immersion. The writing is functional but lacks freshness and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    Opening with a cliché ("like a second skin") and using common similes ("like sugar in tea") weakens the line-level freshness; abstract phrasing ("tidal longing") distances the reader from the embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by abstract descriptors ("luminous ache") and stock similes ("churned like boiling milk"). These artifacts dampen the visceral impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from "purple" over-writing and mixed metaphors ("smelled of hope," "pulsing stillness"). Clichés abound ("labyrinth of grief," "clinging like an anchor"), and the reliance on abstract nouns in place of concrete imagery weakens the line-level craft significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is polished but heavily reliant on genre clichés ("stars seemed close enough to pluck," "polished to a mirror sheen," "magic older than memory"). These stock phrases flatten the imagery and reduce the distinctiveness of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose relies on clichés ("sunlight breaking through clouds," "identities shifted like shadows") and repetitive tagging ("shrewdly innocent" appears twice). These artifacts dull the imagery and weaken the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but marred by clichés ("mist curled like smoke," "time blurred") and repetitive sentence stems for transitions. While imagery like "zephyr bloom" is strong, the "reflectively vibrant" construction is slightly awkward.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and the imagery is distinct, but the repetition of the specific phrase "honeyed hush" constitutes a distracting loop. Additionally, the density of "precious" descriptors (mosslight, trapped time) occasionally threatens to stifle the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is competent but heavy on adjectival modification ("unsettling clarity," "lucidly watchful") that slows momentum. The insertion of the prompt phrase "ephemeral cameo appearances" creates a jarring register break, clashing with the established literary tone.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from frequent clichés ("liquid gold," "lover's finger") and clumsy repetition ("gathered in a gathering hush"). These artifacts, combined with an over-reliance on adjectives, reduce narrative density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("time seemed to thicken," "heart racing," "hold its breath") and filter verbs. The climax relies on stating emotional reactions ("chest heaving with emotion") rather than evoking them through fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but dense with adjectival padding (&quot;dim light,&quot; &quot;polished gear,&quot; &quot;latent energy&quot;) that slows momentum. Similes like &quot;gears scattered like dead leaves&quot; are cliché, and the line-level craft lacks the sharp economy and freshness required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains vivid imagery but is marred by significant repetition of the term "hush" (9 instances) and "fractal" (6 instances) in a short space. Additionally, the phrase "trapping souls in a boundary-lessly trapped limbo" creates a jarring tautology that disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mechanically sound, but the prose is dense with modifier-heavy phrasing ("chipped enamel kettle," "rust-hued peace") that slows momentum. The heavy reliance on abstract metaphors ("raw material of memory," "crystallized time") in place of concrete imagery creates a texture that feels more constructed than observed.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is competent and maintains momentum, with no major loops or artifacts. However, it relies on some somatic clichés ("Regret coiled... hot and familiar") and standard metaphor structures that dampen the impact of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weighed down by a high density of "writerly" clichés ("bruised twilight," "pool of moonlight," "skeletal remains") and abstract metaphors that obscure the action. The engineering descriptions are vague ("recalibrating... hidden conduits"), and the line-level rhythm is monotonous, often relying on adjective-heavy description.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished but overly dense with figurative language, containing a simile or metaphor in nearly every paragraph ("clung like a second skin," "heart a pendulum," "shimmered like a frozen lake"). The reliance on familiar phrases ("second skin," "heart that ticked in time") detracts from the otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is marred by cliché similes ("creaking like a door to the past") and a repetition loop where both the world and the water "held its breath" in the same paragraph. The reliance on abstract metaphors ("fog of misdirection," "labyrinth of lies") instead of concrete imagery stalls momentum and obscures the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("salt-stiffened strands"). However, it occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("birthed it," "oceanic hush") that prioritizes sound over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high density of clichés ("silver river," "whisper of autumn leaves," "stark relief") and purple descriptors. Phrases from the prompt are repeated as refrains ("after the last ship sailed"), creating a repetitive cadence without adding narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is functional but frequently overwrought ("riot of," "cacophony of," "quaking reverie"), stalling momentum with dense adjectival lists. "Pulsed like a dormant heartbeat" and similar similes feel stock rather than fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm is generally strong, but the physical impossibility of the climax (bird flight) indicates a lack of attention to detail. The phrase "gracefully alert" is inserted awkwardly, disrupting the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting ("fractured starlight," "defiant hush") and heavy adjectival density. Repetitive sentence structures ("The first breadcrumb," "The third breadcrumb") create a list-like cadence that drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from some repetitive phrasing (the "quiet sigh of falling petals" refrain). The density of figurative language occasionally obscures clarity, prioritizing poetic sound over precise meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but leans toward purple ("understanding dawn like sunlight"), includes a clear typo ("a echo"), and uses scaffolding ("The spectral mentorship had begun") that tells rather than shows. The oxymoron "thundering calm" confuses the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally functional with some strong imagery, but marred by forced phrasing ("searing reverie") and adjectival stacking ("ethically diligent mind"). These text artifacts disrupt the rhythm and feel inorganic to the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from heavy adjective stuffing ("velveteen gloom," "tenderly organized," "skeletal finger") and lack of verb energy. The mechanics of the key action—"untangling a thread that led to a name"—are vague and physically confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional and clear but marred by clichés ("ancient bones shifting," "bloodshot eyes") and "tell" heavy phrasing. The phrase "groundedly imaginative leaps" reads as an awkward prompt insertion that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and noun stacks ("shortwave radio dial glow"). Several phrases hover near cliché ("curled like smoke," "tasted of iron"). The phrasing "thistled calm" is semantically opaque and feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from abstract-concrete mismatches ("resin and regret") and clichés ("glittering like stardust") that undermine the literary aspiration. Sentence structures are repetitive, often relying on standard subject-verb openers that create a sluggish, "and then" rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from clustered clichés and purple phrasing ("clung like a second skin," "putrid perfume," "gravel in a tin can," "razor wrapped in silk"). While the rhythm is competent, these artifacts reduce freshness and precision. The visual clarity of the digging scene is a strength, but the metaphors need pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but suffers from abstract phrasing ("traveled stillness," "denoting the space"). Key concepts are often told through "The [noun] was [definition]" structures, slowing momentum. The usage of "unlearning hatred" as a spatial/temporal preposition is grammatically forced.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by "adjective stuffing" to fit prompt terms ("informally wise intuition") and some cliché phrasing ("sculpture of light and life"). The pacing is steady, but the reliance on scaffolded sentence structures reduces the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is competent with some nice lyrical touches ("nectar dusk"), but suffers from clichés ("air hummed with restless energy"). The pacing drags during the middle exposition block, and the ending feels rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is competent but marred by "purple" anthropomorphism ("streetlights daydreamed") and telling ("inadvertently profound"). The pacing drags during the exposition of the theory, and the line-level work lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is descriptive but relies on clichés (e.g., “hit Mara like a wave” in an underwater story, “liquid starlight”). There is a dependency on filter verbs (“Mara realized,” “She saw it as”) that distances the reader from the immediate action. While grammatically clean, the density of adjectives and similes slows the pace without adding necessary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose has momentum but suffers from occasional purple phrasing ("eyes like tarnished silver," "tasted of ozone and regret") that leans on cliché. The adverb-heavy construction "balancedly daring" is a stylistic stumble that momentarily weakens the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose suffers from "purple" tendencies ("orchids bloomed like defiant lips") and the "97 hours" claim contradicts the character's physical dexterity on the page. Several moments tell rather than show ("methodically hopeful").

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm is competent, but the logic break in the central "thaw" metaphor (ice preserving vs. thaw destroying vs. thaw rebuilding) creates confusion at the line level. Some beats rely on cliché constructions ("As the loaves rose, so did Lila's hope").

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by the forced, repetitive insertion of the phrase "neatly inventive" as a tag. Reliance on "as if" similes (four instances) and clichés like "slicing... like a blade" dampens the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from adjective density ("guttural growl," "ghostly blue," "grotesque mosaic") that slows momentum without adding precision. Phrasing is often clunky to accommodate required elements ("unbosom her fear"), and "tell" sentences ("repulsive allure... was undeniable") replace concrete observation. The text lacks rhythmic variety, settling into a functional but unpolished cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm and density are generally good, but distinct artifacts mar the execution. The "sheet music" simile is repeated twice in the opening section ("frayed like sheet music," "scattered... like discarded sheet music"), and the repetition of "euphony" and "fractal" feels circular rather than cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by cliché phrases like "cold sweat broke out" and "breath hitched." The mandatory phrase "quietly drove herself" is syntactically awkward and disrupts the rhythm of the sentence, reading as a visible prompt artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("Elara realized," "She understood") that mute immediacy. Clichéd phrasing ("pulse quickened") and slightly purple descriptions ("greenish folds") detract from the line-level quality. The text relies on summary to convey emotional shifts rather than showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing ("cradling murky water," "stoically sensitive gaze"). A notable grammatical error occurs with the required action verb ("She wrest it open" instead of "wrested"), and the text relies on adjective-heavy telling over concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from clunky, forced modifications like "casting dappled resolve," which is a mixed metaphor. The reliance on telling ("Her motivation was clear") and cliché ("crept... like a thief") flattens the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished but suffers from affectations like the concrete-abstract pairing "lavender smoke and regret." High density of metaphor sometimes obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally dense and propulsive, but relies on some stock phrasing ("images flashed," "node screamed") during peak intensity. The explicit naming of the tone ("bleak exhilaration") reduces the impact that describing the sensation itself would have achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally polished but slips into overwriting ("secret for light-years") and cliché ("ears tingle"). The spatial logic of the action sequence (hook vs. lever) is murky, obscuring the physical cause-and-effect of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and mixed metaphors ("conscience like barnacles," "tasted of secrets," "silence, a fortress"). Frequent repetition of key phrases ("weight," "sieved hush") within a short space creates a redundant cadence, and the density of figurative language distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is frequently overwritten, relying on clichés ("mist clung like a second skin," "razor's edge") and mixed metaphors ("furrowed hush," "scent of ozone"). The tendency to pair abstract concepts with physical objects ("stones pitted by... regret") reduces clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by mixed or inaccurate metaphors ("sharp as a sextant's edge"—sextants are precision instruments, not blades) and clichés ("waves slapping... like a metronome," "liquid mercury"). These artifacts dampen the vividness and suggest a reliance on stock imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is competent but hampered by a high density of stock similes and clichés ("voice a rustle of autumn leaves," "eyes like fractured glass," "sound like gravel"). These artifacts reduce freshness and lend the writing a "purple" quality that distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Polished and rhythmic prose, though occasionally overwrought ("dormant hearts," "willow-whispers"). Abstract labels like "cosmic intimacy" and "unspoken things" replace concrete showing in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but prompt integration forces semantic errors ("unfastening the saucer's crack," "cracks we willingly perplex"). These usages break the physical logic of the sentence to accommodate required words.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from decorative abstractions ("stitch... with understanding") that blur the action. A notable lexical loop occurs with the phrase "ghostly resolve," which appears in both the opening and closing sentences, drawing attention to itself as an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft is competent but marred by tautologies ("whispering hush") and close-proximity repetition (using "breath" twice in the second paragraph). The prose relies heavily on adjectives and standard poetic tropes (stars dancing, velvet sky) that reduce density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.4)
    Basic proofreading errors ("like a ember," "but a idea") undermine the aim for literary quality. The prose occasionally strains for effect with mixed or awkward metaphors ("winking hush of their footsteps") and relies on filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory details ("liquid green and violet"), though the "clicking" of rocks in sand is a slight physical incongruity. The intrusion of textbook mathematical terminology into a mystic ritual creates a jarring register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés and standard similes ("thin as onion skin," "glowing like a heartbeat," "roiled like liquid mercury"). These artifacts flatten the texture and reduce the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is competent but leans toward purple ("prismatic shadows," "hidden overture"). "Dignified chaos" is used as a dialogue tag and then repeated as a narrative summary, creating a redundant echo. Mechanical descriptions (whirring gears) are standard but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is weighed down by a high density of cliché similes ("moth’s wings," "snake shedding skin," "wind chimes") and a noticeable typo ("like a earthquake"). The rhythm suffers from repetitive sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with stock similes ("sugar in rain," "hanging like questions," "spinning like dervishes") that flatten the imagery. This reliance on cliché dilutes the text’s impact and prevents the sensory details from landing effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from abstract phrasing ("luminous doubt") and some clichés ("dissolving like sugar"). The rhythm is steady, though the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is competent but marred by cliché ("translucent as sea foam") and purple phrasing ("bruise of cerulean"). The mechanical insertion of the prompt phrase into dialogue disrupts the rhythm and reads as an artificial constraint. Sentence structures are functional but lack the propulsion needed for the climax.

    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands frozen at 11:59" advances motif and stakes); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, muddled metaphors, or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with vivid propulsion (e.g., "mirrors shattered. Glass rained down, but...melted"); varied rhythm, no loops in peak dream beats; minor overwriting in opening color mosaic but purposeful for tone, clarity intact at pool closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., stitching advances plot/character/theme); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak stitching beat purposeful under accumulative lens, charging glow on face. Clean mechanics, propulsion matches scene.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry dual duty (action + metaphor) without clutter. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Metaphors are coherent (dust spiral echoes galactic spiral) and paid off. Varied sentence rhythm mirrors micro-tempo of sampling versus macro-tempo of decay; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is image-dense yet propulsive; each paragraph advances knowledge or texture. Mixed metaphors avoided—“bowl of indigo,” “ancient ribs”—stay within canyon anatomy. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. One overwriting risk: three adjective stacks (“liquid swirls,” “fractured rainbows”) in a single beat, but compressed inside a summary, not a peak action beat, so penalty minor. Closing line lands cleanly with no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances heat-map process or emotional charge. Metaphors stay coherent: frost patterns = musical notation; starlight = frozen sound. Strong verbs—“spiked,” “rippled,” “jolted”—propel without adverb clutter. Final paragraph cadence slows into crystalline closure, mirroring the sustained fork tone. No scaffolding, no mixed vehicles, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts tight—each advances knowledge or stakes. Metaphors selective: “spider’s web” lens, “tidepool whisper,” no overcrowding. One paraphrase loop: “city is a coffin too / this place is a coffin” could compress. Otherwise clean propulsion, strong verbs, no scaffold. Copy-edit clean; pronouns stable.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, interiority, and causality (“Sanctions had crippled…hope frayed like old rope”). Metaphors are controlled—quiet as language, bell tone “thin, brittle”—and pay off in closure. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor filter-verb cluster (“Mira had noticed”) but forgiven in past-perfect compression.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten: three consecutive sentences open with participial light imagery (“glowing,” “shimmering,” “lit from within”) in the first 100 words, creating template cadence. Mixed metaphor risk—“twilight…clung like a secret” and “foggy lucidity”—but does not obscure causality. No looped paraphrase; sentences advance knowledge. Read-aloud rhythm is musical; minor tightening would reach 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “The arrow’s design matched the symbols on the keys” simultaneously reveals map-mechanic and recharges object—achieving high density without scaffolding. Figurative language is spare; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided. Minor paraphrase loop (“time blurred in this place—waiting for the right moment to act”) costs a hair, not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information-dense lines (“she’d reinterpreted the rules: destiny’s door wasn’t locked. It was a garden”) advance both concept and stakes. Only micro-loop is “stolen...stolen” in adjacent clauses; otherwise metaphor stays coherent, no scaffold churn, and final wind-chime laugh lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies: long reflective lines alternate with clipped discovery beats. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and occupational—molten silica, bubble trapped—so density never cloys. A single mixed micro-metaphor (“ghost of a system”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. High information density—each sentence advances stakes, body, or setting. Figurative language is spare and accurate (“voice smooth as poison”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns after subject shift. Opening line anchors voice; final line crystallizes shell as promise.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, atmosphere, and forward motion. Metaphors are few but precise: “stone teeth gnawing at the wind.” One scaffold cluster—“the silence that thrummed… the silence that waited”—repeats noun + relative clause; it is the only loop. No mixed vehicles or register drift. Final paragraph slows rhythm to match the star’s wink-out, then snaps closed with the scroll roll.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety and information density are high; only minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to…”) dull one beat. Metaphors stay coherent within sci-fi lyric mode. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene pacing; no scaffold loops or mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and polysemous; most sentences pull double duty—advancing plot while texturing silence. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“the forecourt…gleamed like a promise”) and recharged in the final glow, avoiding overwritten beats. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. One micro-loop detected (“the crystals hummed…their vibrations resonated”) but it occurs early and does not touch closure. Grammar clean, pronoun reference unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances either tactile detail or causality. Figurative language is spare and precise—“twisted like a question mark” teaches the maze’s skepticism early, paid off when the vine literally rewrites the path. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“guided,” “blocked,” “recalibrated”). Copy is clean: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips. Final line achieves charged poise without rhetorical inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: “petals unfurling in slow motion” collapses visual and temporal into one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances sensorial or causal data. Opening and closing lines book-end with tactile cold/heat, creating circular cadence without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density: each sentence advances water-level, symbol-read, or emotional register. Figurative control tight—no mixed metaphors even in peak soak. Scaffolding virtually nil; no filter-verb stacks. One paraphrase loop: “water seemed to hum with a melody only she could hear” followed by “melody only she could hear” echo—minor, does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; final line lands with kettle-drum thud.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density—one sentence often layers sensorium, metaphor, and stakes. Minor template cadence in two “she’d never…” / “she also knew…” lines, not severe enough to dull closure. One mixed metaphor (“storm seeped into her bones” beside “metallic tang of swallowed truth”) but physical logic holds. Opening and closing images are razor-clean; no scaffolding or synonym loops.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences double-duty (action + atmosphere) without scaffold loops. Metaphors are spare and consistent (ivy-choked mouth, confession-thick hush). One mixed image: “echo of his boots sharp in the damp silence” conflates auditory echo with tactile sharpness—minor. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge; no artifact intrudes on closure; rhythm breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary in length and stress. Occasional modifier stacks (“moth-eaten tome,” “fractured black”) flirt with overwriting but occur in low-action beats; no clutter in closure. One paraphrase loop: “crumbling peace” appears twice within three sentences. Otherwise clean, high-density compression; environmental metaphors stay coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs; sentences vary. Some lyrical overlay (“music a bridge between mundane and mysterious”) edges purple but pattern is taught and echoes closure. No paraphrase loops; cello, curl, and light returns feel purposeful, not template repetition. Minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to lean in”) do not stall high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “steel ribs rusting into the earth like the bones of a forgotten god” sets tone without purple linger. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—ash, rust, tapestry, chorus—and culminate in the final hummed vibration. A single mixed echo—“the axis shifted back, not by force, but by recognition”—could feel outline-like, but the next tactile beat (hand on wall) grounds it before momentum stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Opening blade-of-light metaphor is vivid; few subsequent sentences overwrite. Occasional stacked prepositional phrases (“smugglers and spies, and its view of the mainland’s flickering lights”) slacken propulsion. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or template cadences. Punctuation and pronoun reference are clean, but one simultaneity hiccup—“She rolled the paper into the cookie, sealed it, and placed it in her pocket”—implies overlap of discrete steps. Overall rhythm supports momentum with minor ear-wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, sound, causality—without scaffold: “He clutched an artist’s palette… only one color remained: a shade of indigo so deep it seemed to drink the light” fuses prop, atmosphere, symbolic seed. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops; rhythm accelerates with clause compression as anchor cracks. One mixed-metor hazard—“velvet so thick it swallowed sound” adjacent to “time folded like origami”—survives because both serve sonic theme. Close to 9+ but final image could shed one adjective for pure knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensorium + motive + metaphor—“ink made from crushed moonstone” does triple work. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “she’d” anaphora lines could trim, but cadence serves accumulation. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally; final sentence lands clean. Artifact-free in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, almost no scaffold; sentences advance image or decision. Figurative language kept scarce and functional (“arches glowing like lanterns” earns its keep). One mixed metaphor ripple-drop could argue for muddle but occurs early and is immediately taught as time-map logic. Rhythm breathes at descent beat, accelerating subtly as gravity returns; no loops or synonym churn detected.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence can anchor season, tool, and interior shift (“autumn’s first frost glazed the cavern’s entrance, Lila found Elias shaping a new drum”). No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; figurative language is sparse, taught early (“filament of hush”), and paid off at closure. Rhythm accelerates naturally during the first vibration beat, then exhales into the final seasonal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, with high double-duty density: “the fog thickened, blurring the courtyard’s edges into a smear of gray” advances both weather and mental state. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (storm of words, silence heavy as a lid) stay coherent. Rhythm accelerates into the zone, then exhales with the match flare. Minor paraphrase at “he’d always nurtured integrity in solitude” could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often layers ambiance, physiology, and emotional charge. No paraphrase loops; occasional metaphor (“silver vapor…like a ghost”) is singular and apt. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs breathe with beats. One scaffold near end—“she’d always thought…now she saw”—is strategic compression, not artifact. No tense drift or simultaneity errors. Read-aloud ear test passes; closing line lands with cadential punch. Minor elevated register in “conceptual repricing” phrase is narrator, not POV slip, hence forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence can deliver image, back-story, and metaphor (“frayed coil…three prisons”). Varied sentence openings, no template cadence clusters. Metaphors coherent—rope map, clay skin, tapestry loom—interlock without mixed logic. No loops or synonym churn; each descriptor adds new mechanical detail about rope or grotto. Copy clean: tense stable, pronoun track clear. Final line lands with image propulsion. Micro-flaw: “ethically playful” is abstract shorthand amid otherwise concrete diction, a 0.1 drag.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the ceremonial arc; only minor scaffold—“the way her music seemed to pool”—slips into abstraction. Mixed metaphors avoided; glass cathedral is singular and earned. One paraphrase loop: “quiet grief of the harbor” echoes “chronic hush” without new pressure. Otherwise, density is high—salt, soil, ash layered in single beats.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences deliver scent name, visual shimmer, and ethical caveat without padding. Rhythm breathes with scene—long sentences for grotto ambience, fragment-like “Test it for yourself” to nail transaction. One mixed metaphor “liquid moonlight” modest, does not recur or blur logic. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts cleanly alter knowledge or charge. Opening and final lines anchor and re-charge petal motif.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean and musical (“salt-tinged air,” “encyclopedia tower wobbling in delight”), with only one mild loop (“the cycle had already begun to turn…” restated twice); no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters, and the final sentence breathes in step with the ceiling fan’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “sap...used to bind his creations” world-builds and characterizes). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors (liquid-mercury time, second sky) extend orchard logic without contradiction. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph breaks mirror beats. One near-mixed metaphor—“time pooled like liquid mercury” beside “air hums with ghosts”—but internal logic holds. Closure line is crisp: shared ache crystallized, no clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: short clauses during tremor, elongation during syrup-time. Metaphors are controlled (“silver serpent,” “second heart”) and do not overwrite. One paraphrase loop: “the pendant had grown warm…today she’d vowed to test its limits” restates prior heat. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Final line punchy, earns send-off.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: slowed drip sentences before ritual, staccato gasp at vibration. Zero scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. No mixed metaphors; sap-light stays liquid throughout. High information density: one sentence slips in twin-taxidermy backstory without pausing momentum. Only micro-loop: “glass eyes… eyes” in adjacent clauses, negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the reel… the reel…”) in paragraph 3. Metaphors (“laughter, brittle as glass”) are precise. Sentence variety and information density strong; no line clogs closure. Sparse deductions keep high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, propulsive; every sentence advances image or decision. Figurative language is sparse and plant-exact (“stem thinning, then splitting”). No synonym loops, no scaffold. One pet metaphor—“circuitously sincere”—is reused three times; it is earned thematic diction, not churn. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless; final line lingers with open-mouth cadence that mirrors the trellis vines.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: single sentences do double duty (“rain had rewritten the rules” = weather + plot). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (amber = sunset = bridge). One mixed vehicle (“frayed at the edges like a watercolor”) is apt to painter POV and does not obscure causality. Final line varies rhythm, releasing tension with quiet cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Purple glow but not murk: metaphors occasionally stack two-deep in single beats (“cloak woven from starlight” adjacent to “molten silver”) yet stay coherent. One paraphrase cluster (“cave’s song… cadences… harmony… melodies”) recycles stem without new data. Filter verbs light. Opening and closing lines hit hard. Overall momentum good, but ornamental descriptor drift in mid-section holds this short of high-band control.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose breathes with scene needs: long porous sentences for silent listening, clipped couplets for discoveries. Figurative language is sparse and targeted (“salt-sting of absence”) avoiding density overload at climax. No synonym churn or template cadence; each valve placement uses fresh verbs (places, kneels, waits, observes). Opening and closing lines echo “ivory harbor”/“symphony waiting to be played,” creating resilient frame without loop artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence lengths contract in the stair-descent beats. High information density: one sentence can set, sense, and foreshadow (“The arrows pulsed with a rhythm that matched his own heartbeat, a trembling certainty…”). No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “his breath fogging the cold air” could lose “cold,” but it is the opening line and stakes mood, not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud cadence: sentence length varies, paragraph cuts are crisp. Occasional soft scaffold—“she realized,” “she thought”—but never in peak beats. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“songs meant for ears long gone”). One paraphrase loop: “transcribe the symbols… letting her hand move through forgotten patterns” restates the prior sentence’s gist, a −0.2 artifact. Otherwise propulsion stays high; no mixed metaphors or register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density—each line advances image or choice. Only micro-loop: “hushed thunder” echo thrice. No mixed metaphors; “fractured rainbow” and “watercolor bleed” coexist under prismatic logic. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs—“shattered,” “peeled,” “fell *through*”—propel closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry double duty—action + sensory cue—without scaffold. Strong verbs (“unscrewed,” “spun,” “traded”) dominate; adjectives rare. One paraphrase loop: “agents exchanged a glance… exchanged a glance” in adjacent clauses (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; ink color logic stays coherent. Clean copy, clear sequence, prop tracking intact. Artifact-free enough for 8+ but micro-repetition blocks 9.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush yet selective: “moss-cushioned stone bench,” “crushed violets and pine sap” deliver texture without catalog bloat. Metaphors stay coherent—humming lamp as symphony, notepad as portal—but occasional elevated register (“flirtation with modernity,” “torrent of invented histories”) drifts above Althea’s likely idiom. No loops or paraphrase, but three adjacent sentences begin “She…” in the climactic paragraph, a minor cadence dent that softens the final surge.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate; no template cadence. Information density high—one sentence often does scene-setting, sensory cue, and motive pulse. Two adjacent “the tide” mentions create micro-loop; otherwise zero scaffold. Figurative language is selective, not stacked; mixed metaphor watch clear. Final line propels with image, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative language is selective: “fossilized question,” “memory trying to reform”—each image advances concept without clutter. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay musical or geological. Sentence rhythm breathes with bow strokes—short crescendo, then release. Only minor scaffold: “its” in “its domed roof cracked” could be trimmed, but density remains high and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling beats without scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“voice like ice,” “mist-capped barge”), never clustering to obscure causality. Information density high: one line often layers sensory detail, world rule, and emotional tint. No paraphrase loops or register drift; occasional adjective–noun pairs (“gilded barge,” “drowning clown”) serve immediate atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary, no template cadence detected. Information density high—each line advances camera setup, chronometer, or sand-grain mechanics. Minor scaffolding: “She checked her chronometer: 04:57…” is necessary timing, not loop. One metaphor string (“golden gas that danced”) is restrained and pays off in final image; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and echo motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose breathes with scene: clatter / mist / solder hiss rhythm. Figurative control: “mist like second skin” opens, then restraint until “liquid sunlight” flash at climax. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new sensory or causal info. Strong verbs (“clung,” “solder,” “refracted”) replace modifiers. Final line lands on resonant noun-phrase “light’s lessons,” capping motif.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers image or knowledge. Figurative control peak: “the lake’s surface rippled, though the wind had died” marries external anomaly to internal reconfiguration without purple drift. Rhythm accelerates across the midnight groan, then exhales into dawn quiet, mirroring escalation and release.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates with scene tempo: long sentences mirror patient waiting, fragment (“A child laughed”) marks the sonic eruption. Metaphors stay sonic or tactile (never visual cliché) and repay the pattern. One paraphrase loop: “rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones” repeats thrice with minimal variation—within lyric tolerance but prevents 9+. No filter-verb clusters; props track cleanly (fork, satchel, boots). Opening line anchors stakes and voice simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges the fork’s lingering tone.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, sensory, rhythmic; sentences vary in length and never stall momentum. Figurative language is selective—“secrets coiled like eels”—and doesn’t overstay. No synonym churn or template cadence; “time ran short” is the only repeated stem, a negligible artifact. Final line breathes: “the gathered hush was gone, but its lesson remained,” delivering closure without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Succinct high-density lines (“lattice…twisted like a question”). Metaphor clusters taught early; no mixed vehicles at closure. One scaffold paraphrase spotted (“tightened”/“tightening” within two lines) but outside climax. Pacing breathes correctly during hover. Read-aloud ear test passes; final keyhole simile lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies sentence length to create breath-like ebb under eerie calm; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is selective and paid off—meteorite bead echoes fallen star, pomegranate splits into vortex—so density remains purposeful. Register stays high-lyric but internally coherent; no mixed metaphors. Copy is clean; pronoun and rune references stable. Opening line anchors stakes and final line (“the ghost bride’s laughter lingered”) supplies image-based cadence that recharges motif.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one line nets scenery, body, tool (“anchored…walked backward…letting the thread trail”); metaphors stay coherent (thread = question mark) and no looped stems clog the climax; minor dock for two adjacent adjectives (“color-bled plates”) that could compress tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, action, interior (“roots twisting like serpents through ribcages”) without metaphor clash. Varied sentence openings; paragraphs breathe. One paraphrase loop (“she thought of…she thought of…”) mid-climax costs −0.2; otherwise propulsion clean. No scaffold or artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is taut, high-density; most lines do two jobs (move, describe, or theme). No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent—phoenix seal returns intact. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, satisfying ear test. Occasional elevated adjectives (“honeyed,” “cyan”) risk decorative stacking, but they serve POV’s chromatic obsession and never clog a beat. Minor punctuation elegance: em-dash in vendor interjection keeps momentum breathing.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: embroidery jargon, telescope politics, and coup dread packed into single sentences without paraphrase loops. Rhythm modulates—long breath cadence for description, staccato for Jaxon’s warning. Figurative layer survives the flame test: galaxies “wink,” silk “breathes,” no mixed metaphors. Minor overuse of participle openers, but never within climax beats.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences under song, staccato “Show me” at apex, gentle close. Figurative language dense but coherent—water, light, stone vehicles interlock without self-contradiction. No scaffold loops; every sentence advances image or pressure. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“ephemeral,” “alabaster”) slightly over-ornate for swamp grit, but stays within established lyric register. Opening and closing lines are strong image anchors; condensation paragraph is high-density without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The coral’s grooves mirrored the smudged pencil marks” fuses object, theme, and visual in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last (“sharp things can carve new paths” logically follows scarred general’s touch). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, not abstract. One mixed vehicle—“mist curled like a ghost’s fingers” beside “anesthetic kicked in”—is momentary and does not cloud closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density high—“encrypted notes left in hollow trees” compresses an entire economy. One metaphor cluster near climax (“reckless, pensive mirth”) borders on overwrite but is saved by its oxymoronic charge. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold; occasional “of”-phrase stacks are voice-true. Final line earns its monosyllabic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “pigments mixed from crushed minerals and dreams” seeds both world rule and character motive. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent (sound as key, coin as prism) and pay off in closure. One register lift—“Conceptual Repricing” in editor voice—goes unnoticed in flow, not enough to ding.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean and vivid, but metaphor density spikes in the greenhouse intro (“snap-jaws glinting,” “humid air clung”) without pattern justification, creating momentary purple tint. One template cadence run: “Elias grinned” appears twice in four paragraphs. Otherwise syntax varies, verbs stay strong, and paragraph cuts are purposeful. Closure line “The warp had just begun” is crisp, sending reader back to title without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic control mirrors acoustic theme: longer, resonance-rich sentences during singing; clipped fragments during toolkit work. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays within light-sound domain. One paraphrase loop spotted (“the crack… its crack”) but does not touch closure beat. Information density high—single sentences layer setting, tool, emotional stakes. Read-aloud ear test passes; final line hums back to opening image, sealing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative language is selective—volcano “pulsed like a sleeping giant,” adhesive “whispered”—never stacked. Each sentence advances either decryption progress or geological metaphor; no paraphrase loops detected. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Minor scaffold: “measure the distance… the angles” could compress, but the repetition mirrors machinist protocol and does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “He released the pigeon, watching it vanish into the sky. Then he turned to the skylight….” Action, image, and emotional pivot in two lines. No scaffold loops; varied openings avoid drumbeat. One mixed metaphor—“the echo of lost songs blooming and withering”—occurs in the final clause; because it reweights the premise under Accumulative lens and carries conceptual cost, it is allowed. Otherwise metaphors stay coherent and sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density (“codes are stories we haven’t lived yet”), minimal scaffold. Mixed metaphors kept coherent: light = hush = map = memory. One paraphrase loop: “the way stalks bent… the way shadows pooled” could compress. Rhythm breathes at hinge lines (“She kept walking”), propelling to resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined; figurative language stays tethered to marine optics. Occasional soft filler (“softly ingenious,” “gentle hand against glass”) drifts toward template cadence. No mixed metaphors or loops, yet density drops in mid-section during researcher gathering. Closure line lands clean without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long liquid sentences for kneeling contemplation, clipped fragments at the reveal. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—“she pressed them into the crater glass, watching as the shard’s cloudiness began to clear” does triple duty (action, sensory, causality).

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes: long salt-inked sentences swell, then clipped bow strokes punch. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each detail (cracked clown paint, compass rose glint) advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—neon as nervous fish, melody as collision—never mixed. Information density is high: one sentence can anchor place, reveal character priority, and cue sound.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: single sentences deliver setting, tool, and stake (“Archive of Lost Things, where relics of the Before were locked away”). Metaphors are physically coherent—stars swirl like a cloak only while she hangs mid-air, then settle. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Micro-loop: “obsidian grace” appears twice without new charge, a −0.2 artifact that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, varied sentence length; few adverbs, strong verbs—“waded,” “bled,” “chugged.” One paraphrase loop: “value in the mundane” is stated, shown, then notebook-repeated; minor. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent to light/water. One filter-verb cluster—“she believed,” “she thought”—but not during peak beat. Closing line is crisp, earns its lift.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold—“he’d… he’d… he’d…”—in backstory paragraph. Metaphors (moonlight as milk, celestial lullaby) are consistent and non-contradictory. Opening and closing lines carry propulsion. One paraphrase loop mid-story costs −0.2, keeping it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence variety is wide; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Metaphors are disciplined—algae “pulsed faintly, as if the rock itself were breathing”—and physically coherent. Information density is high: one sentence can locate body, tool, and conceptual stakes (“She pressed her palm to the gauge, its warmth seeping into her skin”). One paraphrase loop: “patterns emerged—geometric shapes that dissolved and reformed, each iteration a step closer to a coherent equation” restates the same idea; minor −0.2, but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so high-band eligibility remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: longer sensory coils contract to single imperative (“Let it burn”) at climax. Metaphors stay coherent—passage as throat, ivy as tongue—but avoid mixed vehicles. No synonym loops; each noun is specific (moss, ash, locket). Opening and closing lines tether and release the motif cleanly. One paraphrase micro-loop around “walls hum/remember” could tighten, but it does not stall propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “colors bleed where her touch distorted the light” does triple sensory duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances mirror, music, or body. One mixed vehicle—“chain coiled like a question”—is minor amid otherwise precise metaphors. Final paragraph slows cadence to match exhaustion, then releases, earning the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with sun arc; paragraphs lengthen then contract to mimic negotiation lulls. Density high—each clipboard scar performs double duty as history and omen. No mixed metaphors; volcanic stone / eroded god faces cohere. Minor scaffold: “the price of redemption, she knew…” repeated thrice; final instance in closing paragraph flirts with thematic echo but lands inside POV musing. No paraphrase loops, no register drift. Proofing clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “He’d funded the dam that choked the river dry, then bought the land when the farmers left” compresses decades into one cause-effect line. Metaphors are selective and consistent—egg as ghost, cracks as language—never stacked in high-pressure beats. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges map/echo motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: each sentence layers image-action-theme. Metaphors stay consistent (loom, threads, prisms). No loops or scaffold; no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with dance tempo. Slight over-lyric in “liquid sunshine” is the only hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long image-driven sentences to clipped reversal command. No scaffold loops; “rust-crowned dome” and “meteor hush” are specific, not thesaurus churn. One mixed metaphor—“rusted crown above scrubland”—is minor. Information density high: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Closure line “inviting you to lean in” breathes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with task—long, silk-strand sentences alternate with clipped exhalations. High information density: one sentence can tether body, tool, light, emotional valence. Minor paraphrase loop on “overlooked histories” concept recurs three times; no mixed metaphors. No artifacts in closure beat; lattice dissolution image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “rope coiled like a serpent” is the only simile in the first 200 words, leaving space for ice-creak rhythm. One scaffold—“the rope’s glow spilled… the rope’s light coalesced”—is cut-worthy but does not touch the closure beat. Strong verbs (“snapping and reknitting”) propel the final ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work—“The wax melted, releasing a faint scent of bergamot and iron” advances atmosphere while cueing the hologram. Figurative language is sparse and coherent; no mixed metaphors. A single paraphrase loop:“decay mirrored…fragility mirrored…” costs −0.2. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene needs, and no artifact touches the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “dust-caked stone walls of the ancient Babylonian palace, her lantern’s flicker casting elongated shadows” does three jobs in one line—place, texture, light source. Varied sentence openers; no template cadence. Metaphors stay within physical logic (star-waiting, wind through reeds). One paraphrase soft spot: “every coin saved was a shield against the void’s indifference” repeats frugality concept already shown; not severe enough to dull closure. Final line cadence mirrors opening with desert wind, creating purposeful bookend rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is compressed and musical—“echoes drowned in silence,” “time bending like taffy”—yet every metaphor is anchored to physical logic. No scaffold, no synonym loops, no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice; final line resolves by image, not explanation. One near-purple phrase (“shifting grace of acceptance”) survives because it is immediately ironized by the pin’s visible scar.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “molten glass into new molds” does double duty (process + transformation). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances tool, breath, or path. Metaphors stay coherent—glass mountains slice mist, never contradicting prior physics. One minor scaffold: “the district held its breath” appears twice; second use could be cut for density.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, minimal filter verbs. One mixed metaphor (“petals raining like confetti”) briefly dulls bloom magic. No synonym loops or scaffold. Final line cadence lands cleanly. A single over-figurative phrase keeps it from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long sensory sweeps and hammer-short beats: “She’d done it.” No filter-verb clusters; strong verbs (“fused,” “exhaled”) carry motion. One near-loop “shell/shell” in adjacent sentences survives because the repetition is functional mirror, not artifact. Metaphors stay coherent—pollen as comet ash, library as infinite shelf—and none obstruct the closure image. High density with zero scaffold earns the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—one sentence can layer sensory cue, world rule, and emotional charge (“diary pressed to chest, its cipher only she could read”). Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer clauses in maze crawl, clipped fragments at guardian encounter. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sentence for fog, staccato for key-press. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal grain. Metaphors stay coherent (garden = memory plot) and do not invade high-pressure beat. One scaffold near “the ship lurched, the fog parting” could trim to “fog parted as the ship lurched,” but artifact is minor and outside closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, varied in rhythm, and high-density: one sentence often layers gear-sound, scent, and thought. No loops or mixed metaphors; one filter-verb cluster (“she realized”) is minor and outside the final third, so 9+ is not barred.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “The cracks began to vibrate, their edges blurring as if the ice were melting into sound” advances action, sets visual, and cues physics. No scaffold loops; figurative language is spare, each metaphor grounded in cave acoustics. Register never drifts above the mapkeeper’s sensory lexicon. Final line cadence—“the harmonic caves were whole once more, their song reborn”—resolves by image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative language is sparse under peak pressure; “shard of hush” is taught early and paid off. High information density: one line often layers sensory, emotional, and cosmological data.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does two jobs—“Rainwater still pooled in the grooves of the monuments, each puddle reflecting a fractured sky” sets scene and mirrors stakes. Minor loop penalty −0.2 for repeated “the hush deepened”; otherwise no scaffold or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent within physical logic (solid fog, gelatinous sheen). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. No artifacts in final third; 9+ not disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “gardens of fire-lilies that pulsed like living embers” fuses sight + metaphor + stakes in one stroke. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for approach, staccato for ignition—without algorithmic pattern. Minor paraphrase loop around “filter/filtered” appears 3× but serves motif, not clutter, and never infects closure beat. No mixed metaphors or scaffold; every clause advances image, motion, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided; “moonlight fractured” is precise. One lapse: “texture visible in the way sand shifted” edges toward abstraction when tension is highest. Otherwise read-aloud fluent; final sentence earns its hush.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences carry sensory, emotional, and world data without scaffold. Metaphors are sparse, precise—“silence tasted of honey and old wood”—and never stack into purple accretion. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances choice or texture. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from tight bunker clauses to open-vowel trellis lines, mirroring pressure release.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is loop-free, high-density; figurative language is selective and paid off (“storm glass had become a prism”). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Opening and closing sentences are ear-tested and propulsive. Minor overwrought phrase—“vaulting hush that made the air itself seem to hold its breath”—is the only hairline slip touching closure-adjacent beat, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract during ascent. No loops or synonym churn. Occasional modifier stacks (“hologram trapped in time”) flirt with purple but serve tone. Strong verbs, concrete nouns. One participle opener flagged but action sequence clear. Closure image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is mostly clean; one scaffold loop (“the line… the line…”) appears in paragraph 1 but does not recur. Mixed metaphors (“emptiness had grown heavier”) are minor and paid off by embodied grip at the end. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or motive. No artifacts in closure beat, allowing 9+ eligibility in other categories.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are dense and image-rich yet propulsive; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn mar the climax. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) nudges register drift but never clouds causality. Final line (“ready to write the next chapter”) is crisp, avoiding scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often paints setting, mood, and stakes. Occasional poetic lift—“glass walls rippling like water”—is earned and brief. No synonym loops or template cadence. One mixed moment: “shivering bliss prickled his skin” edges toward oxymoron cliché, but the surrounding cold imagery saves it. Closure line is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence layers mildew, forgotten years, and bowing shelves. No mixed metaphors, only one template-cadence run (“the way…” triple) that is pattern-taught and paid off; the final clause “heart full” skirts label-speak but survives on context.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences propel without scaffold. Only two mild loops: “the key…a promise” and “the key…symbol” restate the same equation. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb bloat; the final line lands clean. The minor repetition caps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentences lengthen then fracture under musical pressure. No loops, no synonym churn. Figurative language dense but never muddled—metaphor vehicles stay optical/sonic. One mixed risk: “ghost’s whisper” beside “saxophone’s cry” could clash; context justifies. Information density high; every paragraph advances image or stakes. Closure line clean.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is mostly lean and image-dense; sentences vary in length and avoid template cadence. Mixed-metaphor risk in “branches twisted like ancient veins” is justified by arbor’s living-organ conceit. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information dual-loaded (“moonstone dust speck glinting…whisper”). Peak beat (“leaves…markings now clear and steady”) remains uncluttered, preserving momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; sentences open varied. Mixed metaphors avoided. One scaffold loop: “uncertainly certain” is repeated mantra-like; because it reweights concept at closure, the repetition is functional, not artifact. No filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph could trim one adjective (“random intervals”) without loss, but line-level clarity never falters.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences breathe with sensory verbs and metallic nouns; no filter-verb clusters. One scaffold: “molten-metal pit, its surface a molten gold...” (near-paraphrase) costs −0.2. Otherwise density is high—each line layers temperature, smell, myth. Closure line “glow extinguished” lands clean, no mixed metaphor. Publishable with a quick polish pass.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraphing mirrors dawn light expansion. No scaffold, no synonym loops, no mixed metaphors. “Quiet resolve that burned like a candle in a storm” is the single stock phrase; otherwise nouns and verbs are concrete. Adjectives purposeful (old dust, invisible harp). Momentum breathes—compression during approach, expansion during laughter diffusion. Grammar clean; tense stable; pronoun references clear. Read-aloud ear test passes. Artifacts do not touch closure; high-band but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sensory sentence → staccato imperative → quiet declarative. No mixed metaphors; UV vehicles stay consistent. Information density high—single sentence often fuses setting, memory, and bodily response. Minor scaffold: “the forest’s light intensified” echoes twice within 30 words but does not dull closure beat. Clean copy, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Metaphors stay internally consistent: silk stalls *hum*, tapestry *bleeds* color, shard *pulses* heartbeat—no mixed vehicles. Opening line is sensorial hook; final line crystallizes without sermon. Only micro-slip: “sharp yet soft” is near-cliché, but saved by tactile immediacy at closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: long anaphoric sentences build incantation, then staccato clauses at rupture accelerate heartbeat. Metaphors stay within physics of glass/cloud/light; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—“dew distilled into bottled whisper” does three jobs in six words. One scaffold trace: “the patrons began to see—not through their eyes, but through…” repeats prior lens image; minor, does not touch closure. No loops, no thesaurus churn.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is thick with figurative language—almost every sentence carries metaphor—yet pattern is taught early (“time… visible as a shimmering cobalt haze”) and sustains coherence. No mixed metaphors or register drift; metaphors stay within optic/geologic domains plausible to Kael. A few scaffold phrases (“burned like a slow fuse,” “sharp as regret”) are familiar, but they land in low-pressure spots. Closing image is uncluttered, leaving the shard’s hum as resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—copper skin, syrup, starlight—each image pays off in the closure image of the crystalline note. No mixed metaphors; “stone wilted near lies” keeps vegetative logic consistent. One minor scaffold: “the act of concealment had corrupted both artifact and owner” restates prior beat, but it compresses necessary context and does not recur, so penalty is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; high-pressure beats compress to parataxis. Info density strong—one line often layers place, tool, and emotion. Minor scaffold: “the air here was…” (tell) could be cut. No mixed metaphors; “mountain observing a moth” is clean. One paraphrase loop “they’d argued, then panicked, then… nothing” (−0.2). Otherwise propulsive; opening and final lines anchor with image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: single sentences fuse sensorium, myth, tool-use—“stone hummed, a turbine-hum reverie that vibrated in her bones.” No scaffold, no synonym loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent; mixed vehicle “labyrinth of fog and shifting tides” is saved by island-as-body logic. Paragraph cuts test clean; each advances knowledge or image. One tiny register lift—“conceptual repricing” notion implied but not voiced—keeps elite tier intact.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between lyrical accumulation and crisp action beats. Figurative language is selective—fiery confetti, map to the hush—never stacked in high-pressure beats. No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Minor scaffold: “the postcards belonged to her grandmother” could compress, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: one sentence often conveys sensory data and symbolic tilt (“bottle grew warm, as if absorbing his resolve”). No looped stems or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (bottle-as-lens, not mixed vehicles). Rhythm modulates between long breathy clauses and sharp fragments under pressure. Only micro-slip: “hum of spectral echoes” edges toward poetic overlay, but does not obscure causality or dull closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentence for twilight vista, staccato fragments during playback. Occasional scaffold: “the garden filled with the ghost of his voice… the garden seemed to hold its breath” repeats noun-verb frame without new information. Metaphor is controlled (“green thumbprint” is fresh; “velvet disquiet” is earned). No typos; tense stable. Information density high—each sentence advances memory, object, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The sound died too quickly, swallowed by the thick air” advances plot and conveys density. One scaffold loop: “She’d spent years tracking…Today was zero hour” could compress. Metaphors stay coherent—bell tone “like a knife,” clouds “fractal patterns”—no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph cadence slows into earned stasis without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—but the pattern is taught early (“sky hung low…stars burned so close”) and paid off in the final star-speck, so density penalty waived. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; sentences vary in length and cadence. Opening and closing lines are precise and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is spare yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer is disciplined—“sun that had forgotten mercy” is the single intensifier in an otherwise concrete paragraph. High information density: each sentence either moves Elias’s body, re-anchors the box, or filters sensory data through his drought-sharpened priorities. Final image of airborne shards glinting “like stars” supplies luminous closure without metaphoric clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—short clauses at mercury sphere moment, expansive ones during twilight exit. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor (“language losing its syntax”) but it’s brief and pattern-taught. Information density high: one sentence often layers setting, backstory, and emotional tilt. Minor filter verb clusters (“he realized”) but never in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally vivid, but occasional modifier stacks (“pale gold and iridescent,” “storm-gray sky”) and two near-paraphrases (“beauty in the incomplete” vs “transient lay the deepest beauty”) slow the read. Strong openers otherwise; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, causality, or emotional charge. Metaphors are disciplined: “liquid sun” is brief, apt, and physically consistent. Information density is high—copper, rumble, diary, spirit—yet clarity never wavers. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “soft as copper on oak” compresses material, cost, and afterlife into eight words.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, with almost zero scaffold; only one paraphrase loop (“familiar longing… buried beneath equations and footnotes”) repeats inner state already shown. Mixed-metaphor risk—“laughed, a sound like breaking glass”—lands safely because the fragility motif is seeded by glass sculpture. No artifacts in closure beat. Information density high; each sentence advances image or motive. A single over-adorned phrase—“twin pools of liquid mercury”—keeps it from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric rhythm serves twilight mood; sentences vary, propulsion steady. Metaphors organic (‘petals flickering like tiny flames’). One scaffold: ‘he’d learned…he’d chosen…he’d traded’ template cadence in para 4; minor. No loops or mixed vehicles. Clean copy, strong open/close lines.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose breathes with variable rhythm; paragraphs shorten toward the leaf reveal, accelerating momentum. Figurative language is restrained—no metaphor stacking under pressure. Occasional paraphrase loop (“the settlement erupted in cheers” after “cheers” is implied) but no clarity break. Clause order is clean; tense stable. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, not declarative. Minor scaffold present but never touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies: long liquid opener mirrors syrup-time, staccato final lines mimic heartbeat choice. Figurative language sparse and purposeful; no mixed-metaphor clutter. One paraphrase loop—“true north wasn’t a direction… true north wasn’t a place”—is intentional thematic reprise, not scaffold. Clean grammar, meteorite-ink specificity, zero typos. Closure line breathes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is mostly lean, but two adjacent “she’d begun… she’d spent” create minor template cadence; metaphor stack near climax (“nomadic penumbra… elusive state… blurred”) risks purple yet serves concept. No loops obscure causality; final line breathes. High density throughout; artifact-light.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “titles like The Geometry of Silence and Whispers Beneath the Skin leaned against each other” does setting, tone, and character knowledge in one stroke. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “hidden thunder” sustains rather than contradicts the mercury-glass imagery. Rhythm varies: cumulative clauses build atmosphere, then staccato “Rocks tumbled...froze midair” paces the climax. No loops or scaffold detected; every sentence advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes: long kneeling sentence → short thread-pluck → cascading clauses as labyrinth dissolves. Information density high; one sentence often fuses sensory cue, memory trigger, and causal pivot. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line omits scaffold, landing on tactile “fidgeted with his ring” to propel exit. Minor artifact: “tableau of lives interrupted” is a stock phrase, but it sits in a low-pressure bracket, so only −0.1.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusing chess pedagogy with frozen-time curse is fresh, but the tapestry-as-code and guilt-unravel metaphor has prior literary echoes; specificity of platinum labyrinth and ring-fidget tilts it back toward memorable. Conceptual commitment is total—no late rule patches. The transformation test passes: swap chess for any other strategy and the entire symbolic scaffold collapses. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than twist—but coherence stays high, earning upper-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with the climb, no template cadence. Metaphors are mixed once (“crooked teeth… bruised sky… kaleidoscope”) but density never stalls propulsion. Information doubles: “ink made from crushed nightshade” hints danger and lore in one stroke. A single paraphrase loop—“the truth isn’t yours… it’s ours”—is purposeful refrain, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “acid sea lapped… fumes eating air” does double sensory duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Mixed metaphors avoided—acid as thief, mirror, teeth stay within corrosive logic. One clause (“a sound like a million teeth grinding”) skirts cliché but fits POV.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences advance either physical movement or emotional tuning. Figurative language is restrained to two or three metaphors per beat, avoiding purple overload. One micro-loop: “his footsteps echoed, and he wondered if he’d made a mistake” restates anxiety already implied by hesitation; a −0.2 nudge. Otherwise no scaffold, no synonym churn, and strong paragraph cuts that propel toward the pool reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but breathable: participle openers are sequential, not simultaneous; metaphors stay physically coherent (salt-streaked glass, parchment face). No loops or synonym churn; each verb is fresh (“beckon,” “trembled,” “kissed,” “swallowing”). Information multitasks—rain both sets atmosphere and supplies tears mixing with Elara’s. Only one clause borders purple (“dawn bled gold into the bruised sky”) yet it teaches the color palette that recurs in the cork glow, so it earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose propels: each sentence either advances construction or thickens atmosphere; no scaffolding. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“antennae clawing at the sky like skeletal fingers”—and avoids cluttered pattern. Rhythm modulates: urgent parataxis during building; resonant cadence at final hum. One mixed metaphor mined: “moon’s breath” is nebulous, but it sits within a cryptic phone instruction so registers as voice, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, vivid, largely free of loops; only minor template cadence (“She… She…” in two successive opens). Metaphors are coherent (chandelier, currency) and don’t clot urgency. Information density high; most sentences pull double duty. Filter verbs minimal; strong nouns/verbs predominate. No artifacts near closure; final image retains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm flexes naturally: compound seethe of opener yields to staccato trunk discovery. Metaphors (petals “brittle as moth wings,” mist “like cobwebs”) are sparse, precise, never layered. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Information density high—one sentence often salts the air, advances plot, and exposes Elias’s synesthesia. Copy-clean except one missing comma after “dock” in line 1, too minor to ding.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causation. Figurative density is high yet purposeful—“stalactites dripped like frozen tears”—and matches cathedral scale. No mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are propulsive: first anchors stakes, last recharges ants/spiral. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for cavern reveal, fragment for “Empirically intuitive.”

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence advances mood or position. No loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle—“cobalt grotto above clouds stretching like a bruise beneath her feet”—momentarily scrambles verticality, but context recovers it. Otherwise metaphors stay coherent and purposeful, never clogging the climb’s momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythmic variety: short declaratives at climax, longer clauses during reflection. Information density high—“pocket-sized sun engine” compresses profession + scale + tech in four syllables. No synonym loops; “ember nexus” recurs but each reuse adds sensory wrinkle. One mixed metaphor risk—“palette of resolve” borders concept-label, but is salvaged by immediate physical application to shell and gears.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or mythic logic. Figurative language is selective—no stacked metaphors clutter the climax. One paraphrase loop (“I hated them all… I hated them”) is purposeful, enacting obsession. Occasional elevated diction (“jaded wonder,” “conceptual repricing”) is earned by the narrator’s chronicler persona.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One scaffold loop—“the screw wasn’t just a tool; it was a vessel…”—restates without new pressure, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often blends action, image, and lore (“The crystallized ink spread, forming a network of veins that mirrored the scars on his arm”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay consistent (storm/breath/mist). One mixed image—“edges softened by mist that pooled like spilled milk”—is minor. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Clean copy; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold loops; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors total, each paid off (bottle-dove conducts; orchard-silence felled; keys yellowed). High information density: “trench coat frayed at the cuffs” shows status + time + wear in five words. Closure beat is crystal: “bottle lay empty, the dove’s wings still” — no modifier clutter, yet heavy with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful sentence variety; information density is high—each sentence layers image or concept. Figurative language is controlled: no mixed metaphors, no purple stacks. Occasional scaffold (“the softcover dictionary was more than a book; it was…”) but deleted cleanly in revision. Only nudge: repeated “resounding hush” begins to feel decorative rather than propulsive by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is generally varied; however, several “barrier”/“light” repetitions within single beats verge on synonym loops (−0.3). Metaphors stay coherent but stacked in places (“mycelium threading through soil”) risking minor purple tint. No scaffolding sentences or template cadence, and the closing image lands clean, so penalty stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between rain-patter fragments and longer, lecture-echo clauses, mirroring Clara’s twin impulses. No synonym churn or paraphrase loops; “rain tapped a Morse code rhythm” packs two jobs (sound + clue). Metaphors stay coherent—light bending like probability curves—without overwriting. One scaffold clause (“she’d sworn off casinos”) is efficient telling that launches present action. Closure line is crisp, image-driven, prop-free.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Most sentences pull double duty (image + emotional forward motion); only minor scaffold (“She’d…”, “Tonight, though…” opener stems). Metaphors stay coherent—disc as mirror, tunnel as artery. Two paraphrase loops (“sound lingered…reminder that even wrong numbers…”) sap momentum slightly but never obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with twilight cadence; no loops, no scaffold; mixed metaphor count is low (“horizon a bruise” is earned); information density high; opening line anchors stakes, final line recharges flowers/ink motif.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong info-density: one sentence does description, atmosphere, and character (“its arched windows clogged with ivy that pulsed like a second heartbeat”). Occasional modifier stacks (“bruised sky,” “desperate, jocular bark”) flirt with overwriting but serve voice. No scaffold loops; spatial tracking is clean. Metaphors stay coherent—ivy as heartbeat, train to stardust—without self-contradiction. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 8-band ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes—long lyrical sentences for canopy hum, staccato for cane taps. No synonym loops; “vibration” recurs but each time with new sensory angle. Mixed metaphors absent; “trees that sang in harmonics” is consistent with world rule. Only micro-flaw: “time pooled like mercury” edges on cliché, but image is saved by immediate emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates with gravity flux; short sentences under anomaly stress, longer reflective lines in crater stillness. Metaphors are selective, mostly coherent (warped glass, web of timelines). One paraphrase loop—“he’d come here after planting the wrong seeds / he’d spent his career editing history”—but it occurs early and doesn’t blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening sibilant shimmer yields to staccato bow-flicks, then dawn-long exhale. Metaphors stay internally consistent—moon as silver negative, waves as staff lines—never crowding a single sentence. Information density high; one line can split time, reveal motive, paint glow: “He aimed it at the water, framing the moon’s reflection in the viewfinder.” Minor scaffold: two adjacent “the”-openers mid-paragraph, but no loop obscures closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “flames had licked away the artist’s face” carries sight, sound, and tactility in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor. The single elevated phrase—“archive where knowledge was not stored but alive”—is earned by prior sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lyric lushness occasionally overwrites: “shimmering pool of liquid light” + “colors that shifted like memories” in the same sentence creates metaphorical echo without added pressure. Several near-paraphrases (“garden seemed to sing / garden itself seemed to sing”) could be trimmed for density. Clause rhythms, however, are varied and read aloud smoothly; no template cadence persists. The final drum sequence propels cleanly, keeping the line-level flaws from touching the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is propulsive, info-dense: “storm’s energy made the metal walls vibrate, and the air tasted like ozone” performs three jobs in one line. Occasional ornamental metaphor (“edges sharp as knife cuts”) but isolated, not clustered. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Tiny scaffold: “He unfolded his map again” repeats function of prior map line; −0.2. Grammar clean, no typos. Final line “a door opened” is crisp, image-driven. Artifact-free enough for high-band, but not immaculate under 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density: one sentence can set scene, body cue, and foreshadow mirror use. Figurative layer thick but patterned—“bruise on glass,” “silence a wall/bridge”—and repaid at closure; no mixed metaphors. Occasional ornamental adjectives (“cobalt,” “spiralingly”) forgiven for lyric intent. Minor paraphrase loop in “patterns that shifted with her breath / patterns lingered” but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “hush where past meets prophecy” compresses history and foreboding in one stroke. Metaphors (magnetic starlight, forests of thought) recur with purpose and payoff, avoiding purple overload. Rhythm accelerates during rapid-fire moves, then exhales at dawn. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; clauses track cleanly across temporal sequence. Final line earns its cadence without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences multitask (“The fringe gave way to darkness, and she swam, her breath steady, her movements fluid”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—whale eye as “moonlit pools” echoes scrimshaw eyes without strain. One passive cluster (“was gone, was replaced”) in closure paragraph slightly dulls propulsion, holding below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length to match task phases; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“sky… fractured shards”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases image without overwriting. Clean copy, zero artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences advance image or pressure. Figurative layering is high but coherent—quartz as vein, song, threshold—so no metaphor muddle penalty. Minor scaffold: “the world feels both older and newer” abstracts a beat already shown. Filter verbs minimal; rhythmic variation supports breath. Closure line clean; no artifact touches final image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density: single sentences fuse sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“cobalt dust glittered like starlight, but he’d sworn off pigments”). Metaphors cohere under glass/fire/cluster optics; no mixed vehicles. Minor loop: “the plants shuddered… the ivy curled… the rose’s petals unfurled” repeats syntactic stem for rhetorical triad—acceptable as pattern-teaching crescendo. Final line “I’ve just started to see” is crisp, propulsive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“iridescent threads catching light like a whisper”) borders on poetic but stays pattern-consistent. No mixed metaphors; information density high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; no template cadence or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “He’d found... he pressed... he’d learned...” openings cluster in paragraph 2, but break before peak. Figurative density spikes at closure—stars “moved like living things”—yet pattern has been seeded early, so payoff feels earned. Clean grammar, precise punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often performs description, metaphor, and causality (“The cards showed her patterns… but the tape revealed the distances between them”). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed-metaphor muddle. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs (“unspooled,” “snaked,” “hissed”) propel. One minor scaffold: “She’d always been steadily curious…” paragraph edges toward reflective summary, but it is brief and anchors present choice. Line-level craft is otherwise near-flawless, with vivid tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: paragraph breaths swell with light, then tighten into single-line crescendo. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor (liched dust, serpent eating tail) is used once and repurposed in closure. One mixed vehicle—“sour and metallic” for a spoken word—barely bruises clarity. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and mythic freight without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence advances image or causality. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language (“touch like starlight”) is sparse and timed for closure. A couple of adjective pairs (“smooth, gray”) could be trimmed, but artifacts never threaten clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate. One scaffold paraphrase loop: “she’d believed…she’d believed” could compress. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. High information density: “biodegradable adhesive” does world and character work. No artifact in final third; closure image remains luminous, not dulled.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely loop-free; “coffee rings” recurs with变异, not churn. One scaffold pair—“She’d come seeking closure, but the hourglass had opened wounds instead”—could compress. Mixed-metaphor risk in “meteor hush” is saved by context: the universe holding breath. Tense stable, strong verbs, no filter-verb clot.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence advances image or motion. No loops or scaffold; “stardust” recurs with escalating meaning, not churn. Metaphors stay coherent (aurora as portal/breath/chamber) and do not collide. One mixed image—“a sky so vast it felt like drowning”—is earned by emotional overload and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid yet disciplined: “sand that pulsed like a heartbeat” does double sensory duty. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“fractured lullaby of heat and light”—is permissible in lyric mode. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs (“erupted,” “tangling”) propel the final paragraph. Clean copy; no grammar slips or spatial contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: mechanical cadence mirrors gear-turn, then loosens at moss-ground reveal. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (forest-brain synapses). One strained image—“probability bent like willow branches”—but clarity intact. High information density; each sentence advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses without algorithmic pattern; sentences shorten at the scream, lengthen during thaw. Metaphors stay physically coherent—frozen mercury, moonlight cloth. Only nit: “safety is not a cage but a garden” is an abstraction loop that restates rather than deepens the prior image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density, zero loops; metaphors are selective (“star trapped in her chest”) and coherent; sentence rhythm accelerates at pellet throw; minor register lift in “regally unpretentious” but does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or causality. No paraphrase loops; no stacked metaphors. “Bleeding white” and “lighthouse beam” are the only two metaphors in rapid succession, kept sparse and apt. Final paragraph attempts a summative cadence that flirts with template (“one tap at a time”), but it echoes the opening tapping, so pattern is purposeful, not artifact. No typos or tense slips. Clean enough for 8-band, but the slight cadence echo prevents 9.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “liquid gold pooled between rusted cranes” does triple sensory work. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent; “thunderous serenity” risks oxymoron yet pays off in the bay’s acoustic flip. One clause drift—“voice echoing off the metal walls” during barefoot walk—barely grazes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence slips in the Uprising, drone patrols, and regime fear without outline feel. Metaphors stay coherent—kite tail as wounded bird, amber as future-capsule—no mixed vehicles. Only minor loop: “the script began to unravel, its meaning blooming” repeats the unspool image within three lines. Final image is clean, no scaffold, and propels outward.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean and concrete; sentence variety strong, no template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“pearl of stillness cradled like a promise”—is minor. Information density high: single sentences deliver scent, texture, memory. No synonym loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Line-level artifacts absent, clearing 9-band path.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse action, metaphor, atmosphere (“He dipped his brush into a jar of ink made from crushed tarot cards”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (thread as bridge, darkness as canvas). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with climb. Only minor flirtation with purple (“luminescent ache”) but it’s motivated by painter POV and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence lengths vary, openings diversify. Figurative language is restrained—one metaphor per beat—preventing purple overload. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or decision. Minor elevation (“amber bleeding sky”) fits POV; no register drift. Clean grammar, precise punctuation, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, and high information density: each sentence advances image or stakes. One paraphrase loop (“the truth would thaw / the truth was out”) and two “the Council would” hypotheticals dock 0.3; no mixed metaphors; final line propels without scaffold. Figurative language is selective and pays off in the charged poise of the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, memory cue, and metaphor without clogging. Occasional poetic uplift (“sand glittered like fractured starlight”) risks prettiness but stays tethered to POV. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; grammar and spatial tracking are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “coffee stain” line simultaneously reveals bribery, paternal duplicity, and tactile clue. Rhythm modulates—paragraph length breathes with investigative frenzy vs. dawn stillness. No synonym loops; metaphors consistent (orbit, stars, light). Clean grammar; no scaffold. Final line (“dance in their gravity”) is earned, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer—“constellations onto skin,” “digital ghosts whisper in binary”—is patterned early and paid off at amber fractals, avoiding purple density. Opening line anchors stakes and atmosphere; closing line offers image-based resolution. One micro-scaffold: “the firmware’s dissonance—it’s not just noise” could condense, but it does not recur or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high—“tile flake hovered…synchronizing with the rhythm of her chalk” does triple work. One mixed metaphor: “silence began to…breathe” is forgiven because it pays off the living-language concept. No scaffolding in final third; closure image clear.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong rhythmic control—opening sentence’s 22-word sweep vs. closing four-beat fragment. Figurative layering is dense (“stars burned like fractured glass”) but taught early and mirrored at closure, satisfying pattern rule. Minor scaffold: “tessera” is repeated four times in 60-word window mid-story; the noun could have been pronominalized once. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; metaphor logic stays visual-reflective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is ear-tested: varied sentence cadence, no filter-verb stacks, high sensory density without purple overload. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. One metaphor clash—“threads withered before they could bloom”—mixes textile and botanical vehicles, a hairline bruise. Otherwise clean: no loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn; each line advances image or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density: sentences twin sensory with concept (“ozone and acrylic,” “neural map… glowing like constellations”). Occasional scaffold: “The pills? They’re…” rhetorical questions repeat. Metaphors clean but risk stacking (“fractally precise” used thrice). Closure line uncluttered; earns lift. Minor loop −0.2 for repetitive interrogatives mid-paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences vary in length and openers. Few scaffold phrases; “the leaf had witnessed…” recap is strategic. Mixed metaphor risk in “ocean’s breath replaced the absent bustle” stays within legibility. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic control—“wooden beams groaning like ancient bones,” “a mouth ready to swallow secrets”—figurative muddle is avoided. One scaffold loop: “half-remembered tales and half-formed theories” restates the same axis. Density is high; no line dents the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies, openings avoid template, metaphors stay coherent; a few adjacent near-paraphrases (“promise of renewal” / “spring was coming”) and soft abstract nouns (“uncertainties,” “brokenness”) slightly dull edge. Information density is high; no scaffolding or simultaneity errors; closing line lands cleanly on image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary, fog-muted rhythm supports mood. Figurative density is high—multiple metaphors per paragraph—but pattern is taught early and sustains voice. No loops or synonym churn; information density is strong. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing,” “ambient awareness”) nudges above character base, but clarity remains intact. Closure image is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence can stage body, object, and emotional tilt (“He held the bitting gauge tooth between his fingers, tracing its ridges with his thumb”). Metaphors are sparse, precise—“notches like tiny stars”—and never layered into purple. Rhythm breathes: longer horticultural calm, then short metallic beats. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each paragraph advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines are textured and propulsive, the final “protected vulnerability hanging… like mist” recharging the rose/ harbor imagery without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose achieves high density without loops: each sentence layers image, motion, stakes. Metaphors stay internally consistent—tidal, lunar, fossil registers never clash. Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph breaks coincide with hum crescendos. Minor overwriting in “atomically reflective” phrase (−0.2) but does not touch closure; final spiral image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, no looped stems; figurative language is spare and patterned—“liquid light,” “chestnut feathers”—taught early and paid off. One near-scaffold: “the letters never held the thread…” restates prior idea, but momentum recovers. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propelling without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; sentences vary in length to match rising transmitter whine. One scaffold loop—“the tricksters… the tricksters”—in adjacent clauses, but it occurs early and doesn’t recur at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: single sentences layer sensory data and emotional charge. No paraphrase loops; metaphors (constellation-teeth, rubber walls) are consistent with taught spatial-mutiny rule. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges gateway motif. Occasional elegant telling (“He’d come too far to turn back”) compresses without stalling. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns, varied paragraph cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is muscular and image-dense: “mist clung… like a second skin” fogs both quarry and reader in one stroke. No synonym loops; each metaphor advances new information (ribbon color “bleeding” into cracks = intrusion of humanity into geology). Filter verbs almost absent; when used (“she saw”) they signal cognitive reinterpretation rather than padding. Final paragraph’s cadence slows into elegiac triple cadence—“death and life, forgetting and remembering”—earned by earlier pattern, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative bursts appear only at pivot beats and serve shimmer. Minor template cadence in “He’d… He’d…” opener pair; not repeated enough to trigger cap. Clean grammar; no loops or strained metaphors; momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; only one soft paraphrase loop (“paths circle back” reiterated). Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“dusky harmony”). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Clean grammar, coherent tense, strong verbs. High information density achieved through selective detail rather than overload.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies, sentences carry double duty (action + sensory filter), and no scaffold loops intrude until a minor template cadence (“She had...” x2) mid-vortex. Metaphors stay coherent; mixed vehicle of “warlike serenity” is flagged but fits the tonal brief. Closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density: “edges were serrated, as if gnawed by time itself” does double sensory-concept work. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent. One mixed vehicle: “time pooled like spilled ink” then “sutured shut” (liquid → solid) but pattern holds. Closure line clean; no artifact touches final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse action, metaphor, and world-rule (“roots snaked through the bones of forgotten saints, their white limbs twisting into trunks”). No looped stems; each sentence advances stake or image. Metaphors stay coherent—orchard as grave, fruit as heart—without mixed vehicles. Minor purple note (“souls trapped between worlds”) is earned by prior world-building; it does not stall the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openers, only minor scaffold (“he’d…” x3 in one line). Information-dense: desk-lamp flicker on frayed edges does three jobs (light, texture, emotion). One strained metaphor—“dreams that crashed like quarry dynamite”—but it lands cleanly within closure image, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean but lyric: high density per sentence, no synonym loops, mixed-length paragraphs that breathe with ritual pacing. Metaphors are sparse and coherent (spiral → magnetic field → heartbeat); no mixed vehicle violations. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers image-based payoff. A lone template cadence in “She… she… she…” micro-run is audible but does not stall propulsion or touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with ritual pacing: long sentences for lull, staccato for plunge. Figurative density is high but patterned—salt, tide, gear—so it reads as texture, not overload. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or conceptual grain. Minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not story voice, but occurs outside text.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or emotional density. Metaphors are internally consistent (veins/heartbeat), no mixed vehicles. High information twinning—“walls weren’t just walls; they were veins”—but each clause adds new pressure, not filler.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence density is high: single clauses carry triple duty (“The ivy had preserved them, like a green archive, each message a fragment of someone else’s truth”). No mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (river/water vehicles only). No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts test clean. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from terse graffiti decoding to the lyrical final chord, accelerating then softening in exact step with emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose pulses with variegated sentence lengths, strong verbs (“rippled,” “shifting,” “hummed”), and dense imagery that rarely repeats itself. No scaffold sentences or synonym loops; figurative language is selective, never clogging the high-pressure decoding beats. Opening line hooks voice and mystery; final line delivers image that re-circuits earlier motifs. Minor nit: “ghostly serpents” and “ghostly script” share adjective within 700 words—an echo, not a muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is generally fluid, but metaphor density clusters in the first third (“velvet observatory…liquid moonlight…mulberry ache”) before the pattern is taught; no mixed vehicles, yet a few scaffold phrases (“a thousand unspoken secrets…a thousand years old”) mildly dilute propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and causal work—“The chip flared, its light piercing the grotto’s twilight” advances infusion beat, shows stakes, keeps momentum. Metaphors are coherent—lattice, loom, pendulum—all belong to craft lexicon, no mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactical or sensory intel. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on micro-turns. Artifacts absent; closing line “stillness was never truly still” earns its paradox without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Mixed metaphors absent—“vineyard hush” is extended with consistency. Information density high: one sentence often nails motion + metaphor + interior tilt (“shell...worn smooth by time” implies erosion of anger). Minor paraphrase loop at “cycle of rebirth” reiterated three times; costs −0.2. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with echoing hush, giving cadence payoff. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances causal chain or thickens texture. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“cloak of doubt hung from a peg—woven from years of second-guessing”). No mixed metaphors. Final line cadence mirrors chime harmonics: “He walked into the wind, its chimes a language he’d spent years learning to speak.” Clean mechanics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with trance—long sentences swell, then fracture at the helix moment. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “starlight pooled like liquid mercury” is precise, not purple. No synonym churn or template cadence; each sentence advances pattern or pressure. Information density high: one line often does image, motion, and emotional tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid, with varied sentence rhythms and no scaffold loops. Selective metaphor (“skeletal fingers,” “bruised sky”) avoids over-cranking. One mixed vehicle: “pulse left wandering—a force…in whispers” compresses three metaphors into one line but recovers. No artifacts touch closure; high density throughout, yet occasional elevated phrasing (“relic of ages past”) nudges register above Kael’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid, mostly clean; occasional modifier stacks (“lingering luminance that revealed hidden paths”) flirt with purple but stay legible. One paraphrase loop: “the spire trembled, and the ice around him began to melt” could compress. Opening and closing lines carry acoustic echo without templated cadence. No grammar slips; spatial clarity maintained during vapor float. Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence launch points.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: each sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (planks “groaned like old bones” fits maritime decay). One mixed metaphor risk—“key burned against his thigh” (metal ≠ heat source)—but forgivable under lyric license and POV intensity. Grammar clean; opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, but three adjacent sentences open with “He” in the coin-circle beat, creating template cadence (−0.3); one mixed metaphor (“memory of light… pooled like honey”) momentarily blurs physics (−0.2). Otherwise density is high, rhythm varied, no scaffold or loops near closure. Artifacts do not touch final image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean and image-dense: “stone walls streaked with the amber light of dusk” does triple duty for time, place, and mood. One scaffold loop—“echoes began as whispers… the whispers grew louder”—repeats the noun without new pressure; a −0.2 artifact keeps the score sub-8.8. Otherwise rhythm varies, verbs stay strong, and no mixed metaphors muddy the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence openings, no scaffold loops. Occasional intensifier clusters (“earnestly naive grin unwavering”) flirt with over-modification but occur pre-peak, not in closure zone. Metaphors stay coherent: glass bridge as “frozen light” aligns with sunrise refraction without mixed vehicles. No typos or pronoun drift; high density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean and dual-purpose; “boots crunch gravel” advances both setting and character. One paraphrase loop—“town’s survival against the weight of the lake behind her” repeats prior gist minus new pressure (−0.2). Mixed metaphor risk—“reservoir flooded the valley below” vs. “waters rose” is coherent. No filter-verb stacks; figurative language stays sparse, precise. Closure sentence breathes cleanly, no artifact touch. Density high; momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythmic control mirrors flock pulses: long aerial clauses alternate with staccato flame beats. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory data with emotional calculus. Zero paraphrase loops; “cascade’s colors shifted like liquid stained glass” is the only extended metaphor, paid off in crystal flare. Minor register drift toward “conceptual repricing” in closing paragraph stays within her alchemical lexicon and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong verb-noun pairings (“boughs shimmered,” “node pulsed”) and varied sentence rhythm propel read-aloud flow. Figurative language is sparse and coherent; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop (“keep watching… keep revising…”) and one paraphrase pair (“forest spoke… he’d finally learned to speak it”) slightly dull density but occur outside peak closure beat. Otherwise crisp, clean, and typo-free.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong momentum and varied rhythm; some metaphor density in combat ("sugar in tea," "liquid clouds") but not pattern-cluttered; no loops; odd register spikes ("Council of Synthesis") feel label-like; closure sentence clean; minor scaffold in repeated "energy surge" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence lengths vary, opening phrases diversify. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, or causal payload. Two minor artifacts: “storm-born silence” exact repeat; “ink-black water / ink-black water” near-repeat 60 words apart. Neither touches closure, but block entry to 9-band. Metaphors (brain-ribbed stem) are precise, not stacked.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm deliberate; sentence variety good, paragraph cuts clean. Figurative load high but patterned (air = music, echoes = seeds), so coherence preserved; no contradictory metaphors. Minor scaffold: “macerate the air” repeated 3× in final third without new nuance, dulling edge. No grammar slips; pronouns clean. Information density moderate—some emotional states named rather than shown—but momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“lantern… casting no light but revealing hidden things.” No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “the garden seemed to hold its breath” is familiar, but it sits early, not at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence can layer tactile pain, tool-state, and emotional turn. Mixed-metaphor risk (“bridge… collapsed too”) is brief and character-internal, not closure-adjacent. Rhythm breathes with pressure; no template cadence or synonym loops. One minor paraphrase loop—“creative destruction… felt less like philosophy and more like a curse / wasn’t a theory. It was a choice”—keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and imagistic but disciplined: “spectral fingers,” “reservoir of latent energy” each do double duty—atmosphere plus concept. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; every paragraph advances knowledge, choice, or image. Occasional elevated phrasing (“symphony of existence”) flirts with register drift, yet the context justifies the momentary swell. Final river-of-light image lands cleanly without metaphor muddle, keeping closure luminous and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: single sentences deliver sensory data + emotional tilt + foreshadowing (“ghost of time”). Metaphors stay coherent—starlight as liquid, fungi as veins—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “vanished… vanishing… vanished” within two sentences costs −0.2. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph cuts are taut. Opening and closing lines earn keep—anchor voice and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is sensorily rich yet occasionally drifts into modifier stacks (“glass façade warping the light into liquid fractals”). Mixed-metaphor risk is present but controlled; physical logic is suspended by taught surrealism, not violated accidentally. A few template echoes—“thread by thread,” “one ___ at a time”—appear twice; the final recurrence is purposeful, the earlier slightly ornamental, allowing a −0.2 loop hit. Information density is high; sentences carry double duty; beats advance without scaffold clutter, keeping momentum through an 800-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, varied, and read-aloud fluent; sentences carry double duty (world + metaphor or action + insight). Few near-loops: “unfolded horizons” appears thrice with slightly varied contexts, not excessive. No mixed metaphors; no therapy-speak; diction stays within POV reach. Minor padding in classroom recap paragraph; could trim 25–30 words without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, with high information density—each sentence advances mood or clue. Occasional elevated flourishes (“spectral cats,” “bruised violet”) risk purple but stay sparse enough to avoid density penalty. No loops or scaffold; only micro-repetition of “pulse” serves pattern. Final beep is a crisp auditory closer that avoids overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines are lean, high-density: “tasted of rust and salt, thick enough to choke on” does triple sense-work. No loops, no mixed metaphors; metaphor vehicles obey physics. Opening and closing images echo without repetition. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm varies from cardiac fragments to lullaby cadence; sentences layer job-double duty—“He pressed the porcelain shard into the ink, dragging it across the panel” advances action, reifies metaphor, and crystallizes cost. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“He could see… he could feel”) mildly dulls immediacy but misses closure beat, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The diamond grew warmer in her grip” advances both prop state and stakes. One metaphor muddle—“a throat of endless echoes” mixed with “tidal wave of sound”—is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat. Otherwise density is high with zero scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Figurative density high but patterned—arrowhead as second heartbeat, confessions as shards—pays off in closure. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical. One scaffold: “She’d return… She’d return…” repeated anaphora could trim. Information density strong; sentences multitask. No artifact touches final image; momentum carries to spiral. Clean grammar; strong verbs anchor transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long cadences for orchard dusk, staccato fragments as statues crack. Metaphors are coherent—peaches “like captured sunsets” returns as “peaches fell like tears,” creating echo without loop. No synonym churn or filter-verb stacks. One mixed image—“cloud of iridescent dust that swirled into the air, settling on the statues like a curse”—is minor artifact; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; information density high—one line often does image + emotional tilt + world rule. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: ‘the storm had… the storm had…’ anaphora in closing paragraph is near-loop but reads as intentional drumbeat. One pronoun slip (‘its cork sealed with wax’ could scan as neon’s cork) barely blips clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud cadence varies: short declaratives (“He tucked it into his pocket”) alternate with image-rich extensions. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds either sensory data or causal impetus. Metaphors stay internally coherent (“broken toy” train, “mouse’s whispers” boots). Minor pocketed filter verbs (“seemed to listen”) are voice-motivated; they sustain the tentative atmosphere rather than dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean: no loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Figurative language is spare—hyperbolic planes, “corridor of mirrors”—each taught by context and paid off at closure. Sentence variety propels without purple drift. One near-miss: “the library itself were breathing” risks cliché, but immediately grounded in tactile scarf focus. Overall, high density, clear causal order, read-aloud rhythm intact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “light—captured, refracted, vitalized” compresses process into three verbs. Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Metaphors stay consistent (origami fold, liquid gold) without muddle. Final line reprises “hush of improbable beginnings,” closing sonic loop with propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is selective—‘ribbon unraveling like a thread from a tapestry’—and does not congest the climactic beat. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one sweep. Minor scaffold: ‘the object he guarded most closely was…’ is expository tell; cutting to handling would sharpen. Otherwise clean grammar, correct tense, no homophones, high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no loops, clean temporal order, strong verbs (“hurled,” “drank”). Occasional stacked modifiers (“liquid gold,” “radiant hush”) flirt with excess yet serve the fairy-tale cadence. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clean, vivid, loop-free; metaphor vehicles (barnacles, skin, storm) stay consistent with sea-net imagery. Information density high—one sentence often does two jobs: “Each knot held a fragment of a voice…all muffled by time” reveals stakes + texture. No scaffold; paragraph cut test passes. Minor near-miss: “shadow stretched across the net” could imply competing light sources, but image is clear. Final line “She was ready to listen” is taut, resonant, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new tactile or sensory intel. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“broken halos,” “lullaby for the methodically curious”—never crowding causality. Opening and closing lines echo map/ear motifs, creating bookended propulsion. Micro-scaffold spotted once: “He’d spent years methodically curious…” could compress, but it lands outside the high-pressure beat and does not dull the staircase reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is clean, no scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. Metaphors stay coherent (storm-in-glass = ionospheric loop). Information density strong: single sentences couple salt, date, and emotional freight. However, three consecutive sentences open with “She” in paragraph 4, creating template cadence; also, “physics of letting go” repeated four times approaches mantra artifact. These micro-patterns dull final third, preventing 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with the graffito process—long sentences for swirl, staccato for storm hiss. Mixed metaphors are rare; “sky cracked open” is earned by lightning. One scaffold loop: “the flower press bolt plate” is repeated four times with near-identical noun stacks; this dulls immediacy and caps excellence. Otherwise density is high; every sensory detail also encodes emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is evocative yet disciplined: “gears grinding like a tired heart” carries character and world in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence lengths modulate naturally. Mixed metaphors are absent; “joy beneath anguish is a flame no ice can smother” remains coherent within story logic. Occasional overwriting—“soul that frayed at the edges”—is minor and does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; figurative language is selective (patina like old coins, mourning veil) and never stacks into purple. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances cloud-data or emotional charge. Minor filter verb “she felt” appears once in closing beat but does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image, causality, or interiority. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“spirals that mirrored the constellations”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line crystallizes the continuing burden. High information density packed into 726 words without padding or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The starlings outside screamed as if urging her on” advances both atmosphere and stakes. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors—and peaks only at the orb, justifying brief luminance stacking. Scaffolding nearly absent; one tiny loop: “She’d charted the next great discovery—not just a place, but a truth” could trim to “She’d charted not just a place but a truth.” Otherwise propulsive, clean grammar, vivid verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; figurative language is restrained and scene-driven. One scaffold pair (“He didn’t know what challenges awaited, but for the first time in years, he felt ready…”) states the obvious after the emotional peak; minor but noticeable, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive: parallel triplets create incantatory rhythm without mechanical monotony. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat—and stays coherent (arch as sentinel, nebula as sanctuary). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new visual or social detail. The opening and closing lines act as symmetrical bookends that recharge the bell image, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long winding sentences for ascent, staccato fragments during glass fracture, final soft cadence for lullaby. No filler; each line advances image or causality. Metaphors stay consistent—glass as clockwork, fog as time-stir—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “smelled of salt and decay” could compress, but does not touch closure. High density without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer (“veins beneath the bruised sky”) is brief, patterned early, and paid off by frost glazing stones, so it earns its place. Occasional adjective triads (“tangle of dead vines and fractured stone”) risk ornamental density but remain within POV’s worn lexicon. Closure sentence (“nut…cracked but intact”) lands with precise cadence and no overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence can segue from grief to rheology to sister silence without scaffolding. Metaphors stay physically coherent (foam fractals, nutrient exchange). Only tiny loop: "the pieces fell into place" repeated; otherwise zero synonym churn or filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraphs cut cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace—short sentences for lull, longer for prismatic description; no template cadence detected. Information density is high: one sentence often sets scene and theme ("She believed that before a tale could take shape, there must be a void"). Minor paraphrase loop ("stories begin in the smallest, most fragile things—/a note, a glance, a jar of moonlight") but it echoes list structure intentionally. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Clean proofing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Very high density: each sentence does double duty (condensation sampled, door ritual, vial names erased). Mixed-metaphor risk (“frozen seafoam beneath shifting sands”) is justified by coral pavilion’s own contradiction. Minimal loops; only micro-repeat is “tidal formations” but serves as motif anchor. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beats. One scaffold spot: “remorse, like water, found cracks” borders aphorism yet is saved by chef-water linkage. No artifacts in closure beat—final line is clean concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the pendulum: long sentences for arc, fragments for tick. Information density is high—“teardrop of polished brass” does three jobs: shape, material, and symbolic tear. Two minor loops: “Both of you carry burdens. Both of you keep time” is a paraphrase pair; “its bells trembled, and the grain elevator’s creaks softened into a lullaby” stacks metaphors without pattern payoff. No artifact touches the closure beat; final line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence variety and read-aloud rhythm are strong; information density high—each groove pass advances stakes and image. Mixed-metaphor guard is clean: “liquid mercury” and “shattered constellations” occupy separate beats, no collision. One paraphrase loop—“the mirror wasn’t just reflecting light; it was reflecting her”—is forgiven because it reweights the stake. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance image or action without scaffold. One paraphrase loop—“the seeds of vigilance… buried in the margins” restated twice—slows momentum slightly. Metaphors (serpent-coiled key, specter shadows) are coherent and sparse. No filter-verb stacks or mixed vehicles; clarity holds through the flip.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is sentence-level music: varied rhythm, breath-length paragraphs, high information density. Figurative language is selective—“spines vibrating faintly”—and never clutters high-pressure beats. Zero synonym loops or template cadence; only a single paraphrase loop (“the grove held its breath… siskins paused mid-flight”) forgiven for cinematic pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long, sinuous sensory clauses and curt fragments that mimic breath-hold before moves. No loops or scaffold; every sentence either advances image or escalates pressure. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and coherent—no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters. Final line lands on concrete image that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare and purposeful. Occasional elevated phrasing (“static of unspoken things”) stays within Lirael’s literate POV. High information density; every paragraph advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and propulsive; every sentence twins sensory duty with causal feed (“metallic tang → adds water”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line crystallizes image without exposition. Occasional adjective pairs (“pungent, earthy scent”) risk mild purple but always serve Lira’s professional nose, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional adjective clusters (“bioluminescent light, their growth so rapid”) flirt with overwriting but pass. Strong verb economy and varied paragraph shapes propel the read. Final line lands with quiet snap.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong nouns/verbs (“container monoliths,” “wind howled”) reduce need for modifiers; sensory economy fits 750-word frame. Mixed-metaphor risk—“puzzle box designed to outthink her”—but pattern is taught early and recurs at closure, just tolerated. One paraphrase loop (“the patch…warm”) appears twice; trims easily. Sentence variety good; opening paragraph alternates long descriptive with short kinetic clauses to establish cadence. No scaffold impeding closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathy sentences for aurora, staccato “clang” for chisel. Mixed metaphors are rare; “sculpted hush made flesh” is concrete within synesthetic rules. One scaffold loop: “silence pooled like indigo ink” and two sentences later “silence unravel”—similar liquidity trope without added pressure, −0.2. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean, high-density image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and mostly propulsive, but figurative density clusters in several adjacent lines (“molten gold,” “needle through silk,” “tapestry of grief”) without taught pattern, creating minor drag. One paraphrase loop: “the canyon held its breath” followed by “avalanchingly quiet” concept twice in two paragraphs. Strong verbs predominate; only fleeting simultaneity slip—“ground shifted, and a fissure split” implies both happen at once. Closure image (“quiet hum in his chest”) is clean, unmuddled.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is propulsive, high-density: each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is purposeful—fragment’s “half-remembered heartbeat” foreshadows merge. No scaffold loops; varied sentence openings. Micro-redundancy “light flickered…light flared” is localized and does not touch closure. Grammar clean; spatial logic exact. Final line lands with imagistic punch. Minor heightened diction (“lucid turbulence”) fits tone and is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; figurative language is selective. One paraphrase loop: “He wondered if she’d meant for him to feel…” restates prior beat. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Scaffolding minimal; information density good. Final paragraph could trim one abstract clause to let sapling image breathe alone, preventing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: frost etching, prism glow, arbor pulse all serve double duty. Figurative control—“frozen lightning,” “truthful lies”—remains coherent. One scaffold loop: “She realized…revelation sinking in” could compress, but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; however, occasional modifier stacks (“stoically sparkling hues of dusk”) flirt with purple, and two paraphrase loops near mid-point dull momentum. No mixed metaphors at closure; final sentence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences vary in length; openings avoid template cadence. Figurative control good except “ancient ribcages” mixed with “skeletal hand” in same paragraph—minor metaphor overlap. No loops or scaffold. High information density: hammer-light, shard-blood, orb-warmth compress world, body, tool. One notch below 8+ only because no phrase surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay physical and consistent (quicksand, vortex, thread). One mixed cluster—“gravity reversed, colors inverted”—is acceptable compression during free-fall. Final paragraph lands with cadence variation and no overwriting. Clean copy; no artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes: long sensory sentences in ascent, clipped fragments at lamp death. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stake. Metaphors (“darkness felt heavier, a physical thing”) are brief, single, and apt. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored; no filler between. Minor density alert—three adjectives in “pale blue, smoothed by years” but compressed into one quick phrase, forgiven at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence can stage, sense, and symbol (“glass panels glowing faintly under a sky thick with stars”). Metaphors are clean and consistent—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the shadows weren’t just shapes anymore—they were *alive*” could trim the exposition, but it lands outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and loop-free; figurative layering is disciplined, never clogging causality. Density is high—each sentence paints plus advances. Minor scaffold: “quiet explosions of human experience” appears twice with only tonal difference; a trim would sharpen. Otherwise read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “lightning flashing…like a celestial heartbeat” does double duty as meteorology and metaphor. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Only micro-slip: “quantified sorrow” is abstractly named twice before it is dramatized; a −0.2 hesitation. Final clause “unfolding with every step” is a touch template-earnest, but does not occlude the resonant closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers sensory or causal information. Figurative chains (“plums of molten gold, pears that dripped liquid twilight”) stay coherent under greenhouse alchemy logic; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “the greenhouse shuddered, as if the building itself remembered” is template cadence, but occurs mid-story, not at closure. Final line cadence is clean, propulsive, echoing “seed in winter,” rewarding earlier orchard metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances stake or atmosphere. Metaphors are clean (dust-veiled ceilings, glassy page) and never clash. High information density—every sensory detail also advances POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings. Occasional template cadence (“he…”, “the…”) but not clustered under pressure. Two adjacent near-paraphrases (“heuristically gentle,… cautious” / “approached the unknown with caution”) dock −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is solid—each sentence either advances image, stakes, or atmosphere. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare (“shimmered like starlight,” “colors bleaching like old ink”) and avoids purple clutter. Information density high—e.g., “violet hue” simultaneously paints scene, shows method, reveals partial success. One paraphrase ripple: “She had done it. She’d conjured meaning...” is slightly redundant but occurs at cathartic beat and therefore allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, propulsive: “The stench of brine and opium mingled” twins sensory hit with world-rule in four words. Figurative control high—“trust breaking” captured as audible glass-snap of reels—metaphor stays concrete. Minor rhythm echo: “She’d tried…She’d followed…” repeat-she’d cadence in adjacent lines; doesn’t scar clarity but keeps this from pristine 9. Line density strong: every sentence either clocks time, textures space, or sharpens choice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence advances image, motive, or world rule—no scaffold. Figurative language purposeful, patterned (taste-as-data), peaks at copper-blood without muddle. Rhythm breathes with beats—long sensory curls then abrupt “He spat.” Zero loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line crystallizes reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “moss-slick floors,” “poisoned honey ink.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative density spikes only in the final paragraph, but pattern is taught early (“quill wilts”) so it reads as culmination rather than clutter. One participle opener flagged (“Inside, she found”) yet action remains sequential.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Most sentences carry double duty—sound + motion + light—achieving high density. A few decorative triads (“like the ringing of a bell, like the glisten of ice, like the whisper of the clouds”) edge toward template cadence but serve closure echo. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “she began to build” is filler before the kinetic list. Overall ear is musical, flaws cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“energy leaking like a virus” beside “heartbeat” threads—barely blurs clarity. Otherwise precision in nouns/verbs carries momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic, with only one scaffold loop (“the mailbox… the mailbox”) and no mixed metaphors; sensory detail is selective, not showy. Information density is high—each neighbor’s sentence both world-builds and advances the lore—earning the high-band slot.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify, no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned (spinner/web/dice) and payoff-taught, avoiding overwriting penalty. Occasional stacked modifiers (“concrete bones entwined with kelp and rust”) but never obscure causality. Strong information density; each sentence advances image, motive, or beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density high: single sentences embed salt geometry, memory theft, and occupational routine. Figurative control: “shadows that seemed to pull at the edges of his mind” compresses external light and internal disorientation without overwrought metaphor. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; transitions are causal, not additive. Copy-clean except one minor tense consistency hitch—“had been exhuming” should align with simple past surrounding it, but clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm is consciously musical but never mechanical; variation in length and comma pulse keeps the read-aloud ear engaged. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere or ritual step. Only minor scaffold: “the hush was not passive; it was a force” could be compressed, yet it occurs early and doesn’t recur at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is clean, sentences varied. No loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor—“engravings shifting like liquid”—but clarity intact. Information density is high; each sentence advances. Minor register drift into abstract nouns (“conceptual repricing”) keeps it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty: sensory detail plus emotional algebra. Metaphors stay physically coherent (ink-shadows, watercolor edges). No synonym loops; “shell,” “garden,” “radiance” recur with shifting charge. Opening and closing lines frame voice and stake cleanly. One mixed metaphor—“memory trying to claw its way free”—is minor; claws fit shells only obliquely, but the urgency merits tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “stalactites dripping like liquid time” marries sensory detail to temporal stakes. No synonym churn or template cadence; each metaphor is single-layered and internally coherent. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“seemed to lean closer”). Closure line “echo of her purpose” is clean, propulsive, echoing opening “marble sanctuary” without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyric compression suits the piece—“stone coils like a sleeping serpent” is fresh; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop (repeated thesis “echoes are memories”) and two near-synonym pairs (“reed-blown melancholy” / “low, resonant tone”) dull momentum mid-page. Otherwise density is high; each sentence layers symbol or sensory detail. Final line cadence resolves on an off-beat syllable, mirroring the endless hum—an intentional rhythmic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences vary in length to mimic breath of listening. Minor loop—“the sailor’s ghost had lingered not out of vengeance, but out of love”—re-states prior line, and “windows were fragile things” editorializes, but artifacts do not touch the closure beat. Figurative layering stays coherent; no mixed metaphors obscure causality. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density: every sentence advances image, motive, or world rule. One scaffold loop: “the diamond…diamond…diamond” within five lines—minor, does not obscure closure. Metaphors stay coherent (apples as suns, branches as fingers). Clean grammar, no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “jagged fingers streaking the night with electric blue” does three jobs in eight words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent—storm as language, glass as prism, sand as time—no mixed vehicles. Final line (“symphony of thunder and fractured radio waves”) lands with cadence match to opening, earning its lyrical swell.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: sentence lengths shear from expansive to clipped as the box awakes. Figurative language is selective—two metaphors per beat, never stacked; vehicles stay physical (sand-beast, jarred breath). No filter-verb clusters; props tracked without puppet micro-movement. One near-loop: "the box shuddered, and a tinny, distant melody spilled out" contains internal duplication ("tinny"/"distant") but the echo is brief and sonically apt. Closure line is clean, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines carry triple duty: “His hands, gloved in cracked leather, adjusted the frequency dial” = tactile, backstory, action. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm flexes with battle tempo. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to hold its breath”) is ornamental, not in closure beat. Clean enough for 9−.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong verb density—“filings coiled…straightened…locked” propels without adverb clutter. One paraphrase loop (“the revolution wasn’t over; it had just begun”) could compress. Otherwise rhythm breathes with beats, no mixed metaphors, clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “condensation after the drought finally broke” does weather + politics in six syllables. Metaphors are sparse and apt—walls “writhe” under lantern stress—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies: long sensory sentence cycles into staccato “She lit the lantern.” No loops or synonym churn; one near-scaffold (“watchfully calm” repeated) but serves thematic branding. Closure line is stark, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, sensory, and mostly propulsive; only minor scaffolding—“the air hummed with a vibrant hush” (abstract) and the somewhat formulaic storm-to-redemption arc—detract. Metaphors interlock cleanly: heart/clock, storm/conflict, light/redemption, avoiding mixed vehicles. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; every sentence adds texture or advance. Final line cadence is purposeful, giving a soft landing that reopens rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lines multitask: “The glider—her *Skein*—dove toward it, wings folded” packs motion, tool identity, and emotional tilt. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Figurative control peaks in the final “hum” that is not a ring—precise, unextended, unforgettable. Minor paraphrase near “acid mist seeped…eating at her tools” is the only loop, too minor to cap.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Information density is high—every sentence advances search, pressure, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops; “glowing labyrinth,” “sea of data streams,” and “cold light casting shadows” are distinct images. Metaphors stay coherent (labyrinth→servers, sea→streams). Final line “her mind racing toward the edge of the system” propels without figurative muddle. A single filter-verb cluster “she wondered if Elara had touched it the same way” is minor drift, not enough to dull the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence. High information density—one line often paints frost, emotion, and myth in a stroke. Occasional stacked modifiers (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “faint silver sheen”) flirt with purple but stay voice-motivated. No scaffold loops; figurative vehicles stay internally consistent; tiny paraphrase echo (“storm was coming … storm was a manifestation”) is the only detectable loop.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence clusters or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is spare and accurate—"fold in patience" is the lone slightly abstract phrase, but it is tethered to a physical gesture (gloved hand tightening on the parasol tip) soon after. High information density achieved through integration: one motion (hooking the rail) simultaneously reveals tool, boat, and trapped woman. No scaffolding or simultaneous-action errors; verbs stay strong ("hauled," "groaned," "wrapped"). Only a hairline slip of elevated diction—"conceptual cost" in the final realization—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “lacquered wood glowing like trapped sunlight” does triple sensory + symbolic work. No synonym loops; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Two minor scaffold spots—“the light is fading / but colors are still there” could trim, yet serve transition. Metaphors internally consistent (sun-moon, dance, frost) and paid off in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer hymnic cadence for ritual, staccato for stone-shift. Metaphors stay coherent (smoke-coiled voices, wind-chime laugh) and don’t stack into purple density. One scaffold detectable: “strangely honest” is repeated four times with near-synonym drift; still, it serves thematic insistence rather than clutter. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks; information density is high yet limpid.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and mostly loop-free; only mild scaffold in repeated “as if” constructions. Metaphors are coherent (vines as fingers, arcs as secrets). Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic cargo. A faint register drift toward editorial “we realize” is avoided; the voice stays anchored to Lila’s perceptual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language is selective (“suspended hush…like a second skin”) and does not clog high-pressure beat. One minor template cadence (“He…then he…” ×2) but it does not touch closure. Opening and final lines are sharply anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional fragments that mimic fog drift. No scaffold loops; information is dense. One mixed metaphor—“tidal longing in his veins”—slightly muddles, but does not touch closure. Final line is crisp, recharging “echoing” motif. Minor over-poeticizing in middle paragraph holds score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: “clock hand…spinning like a dervish, emitted a faint, high-pitched whine” conveys motion, sound, and metaphor in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances gear, wind, or body. One mixed metaphor—“clouds churned like boiling milk”—is the only figurative muddle, and it sits mid-story, not at closure, so penalty capped at −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is pleasing; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Density is high—“hymning the mundane” compresses concept and method in four syllables. No scaffold loops, but two adjacent “hope” scents verge on synonym churn. Mixed metaphors (“fragrant reminder that even in endings, there was beginning”) are minor. Closure line “The pulsing stillness of it all” lands cleanly, no artifact interference.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences advance premise or image without scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“key… key…”) is forgiven inside a 740-word limit. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“stars seemed close enough to pluck”). No mixed metaphors or register drift; final image is crisp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, high density: every sentence advances stake or aura. Figurative layer is spare but precise—“certainty frayed at the edges.” Fountain resurrection is rendered in concrete verbs without purple flourish. Final sentence lands with variegated rhythm; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyric patterning (“light,” “stillness,” “pearl”) risks repetitive cadence but is justified by accumulative design. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “pearl of stillness” stays coherent because the text physically makes a pearl that stills water. Minor scaffold: “its surface” repeats three times in one sentence; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; high-density lines (“amber pendant swung between them, catching the mosslight”) do double atmospheric and symbolic work. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds tactile or emotional news. Metaphors stay coherent (hush as syrup, servers as anchors) and do not crowd any one beat. Final paragraph lands on short declarative cadence that releases prior lyric tension without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pulses—longer clauses in mist description, staccato “She deleted.” No template cadence or synonym loops. Mixed metaphor check: “tangled like kelp in a storm” followed by “current waits” is consistent aquatic field. One scaffold phrase “she’d come to” opens two adjacent sentences; minor, does not obscure closure. Density high—single sentences do setting + interior + symbolic tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variation is organic: participial openers (“coiled like a question mark”) alternate with subject-verb sparks (“mushrooms burst forth”). No scaffolding loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors stay internally consistent—gold as sunlight → golden threads → golden dust—so physical logic is not violated. Ear-test pass: read aloud, the prose inhales during buildup and exhales in the final two-word line “just as it should.”</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar eco-fantasy tropes (dying magic, harvest-moon rite) are retooled through the tinkerer’s engineering lens—cogs and pollen vials feel fresh against moonlit ivy. The “spinning vine” re-roots the Midas motif in living chlorophyll rather than metallic greed. Risk taken: quiet ending where nothing explodes, magic simply needs daily tending—an anti-climax that earns its poignancy. Not quite 8.5 because the creature chorus risks cuteness, slightly diluting the edge of necessary sacrificial cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Information density is high: one line can layer cold, material, myth, and motion. Only minor loop: “the way the snow fell… the way the dead trees creaked” is a conscious parallel, not artifact. Metaphors stay coherent—flash-paper as time, apple shells as star-dust—no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; metaphors (frozen starlight, silent wound) are sparse and paid off. Information density is high—each sentence advances mechanism or stakes. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor—“store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is ear-catching but purposeful, so waived. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: single sentences do triple duty—“The grotto seemed to sigh, the air lighter by a fraction” advances myth, stakes, sensory change. Metaphors are grounded (grotto-as-beast) and mutually coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: two “adjusted the lamp” phrases within seven lines create faint echo, not enough to dull closure. Rhythm breathes with pressure—short clauses at crack moment, longer cadence for dawn release.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm: paragraph lengths breathe with candle flare and kettle hiss; sentences switch from participle openings to subject-verb under pressure. Only minor loop—“the wood…raw material of memory” nudges close to paraphrase of earlier “raw material of memory,” but compression elsewhere keeps propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, metaphor, and interiority (“carousel that devoured time”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay physically coherent (lagoon as clock, gears as laughter). Read-aloud rhythm varies: short imperative during release (“I’m tired.”) vs rolling accumulative clauses earlier. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Copy clean: tense consistent, pronouns clear.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean, high-density lines: “Moonlight pooled on the floor, illuminating a jagged metal fragment lodged in a crack” does triple sensory, prop, and mood duty. No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during conduit reroute, then relaxes into longer reflective cadence. Opening and closing images (twilight → dawn) bracket the arc neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective—no clutter in the high-pressure bear beat. Opening sentence anchors voice and metaphor instantly. Minor scaffold: “a scent that clung to her like a second skin” is familiar, but it’s the only cliché and doesn’t touch closure. Rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses during the harmonic moment, then exhales—controlled cadence supports meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “the canal’s stillness hummed with a serene upheaval” fuses oxymoron to theme in one stroke. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops. Metaphors stay physical—liquid silver, drowned coins—and never collide. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, not explanatory; scaffolding is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and informational work (“rope… revealed a constellation of stars”). No synonym loops; “knot” recurs only when meaning reweights. Metaphors stay coherent (dock as temple) and paid off in closure. One minor scaffold: “He understood now” could be cut, but does not obscure causality. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with fog rolls.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary cadence from rolling cumulative clauses to staccato fragments during the crack. Information density high—each descriptive touch also telegraphs world-rule (starlight vials = prior theft). Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. A single scaffold clause (“the world had withered…”) is unavoidable summary at this length. Final third avoids purple overload, sustaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective (“broken mirror,” “wind chimes”) and does not clog high-pressure beats. Information density high: one sentence often does two jobs (anchors + mood). Minor scaffold: “its surface dotted with…” could compress, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no template cadence or synonym loops. Occasional purple flecks—“ashen residue of a thousand unremembered dreams”—but density stays below the penalty threshold and never muddies the final image. Information density is high; each sentence layers sensory cue or action.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm modulates effectively—long breathy sentences for garden awe, clipped fragments during ping crescendo. Occasional modifier stacks (“shimmered like mother-of-pearl”) flirt with over-richness but never stall propulsion; no loops or mixed metaphors. Clean mechanics, precise pronouns, strong verb choices.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “glass panes began to rattle—a low, thundering calm that vibrated in his chest” compresses sound, space, emotion in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Paragraph cuts are surgical; removing any nightly return would break pattern accumulation. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image. Minor overworlding in “restless spirits” metaphor, but forgiven under lyric permission.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; figuratives (“blackened spine,” “jagged teeth”) serve the ridge’s body imagery without overcrowding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed vehicle—“pendulum bob…scarred by centuries of friction” followed immediately by “metal seemed to shiver”—momentarily blurs animate/inanimate, but the effect is brief and closure clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long, soil-heavy clauses and short luminous fragments (“1899,” “Alistair”) that mimic thread-snips. Metaphors stay physically coherent—threads equal voices, constellations equal dates—so no mixed-vehicle clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances either discovery or cost, culminating in the spare final line that lets the stars shimmer without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long sentences for cataloging, fragments for crack moment. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds data or temperature shift. Metaphors stay physical—gears, lubricant, ledger—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with ash image that recharges “sketched” future. No scaffolding artifacts in closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “ember alcove where mist curled like smoke from forgotten hearths” fuses setting, temperature, and history in one stroke. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the music/wave motif. Sentence rhythm breathes with signal rise and fall. Only hairline slip: “thistled calm” is novel but context teaches the image by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical without mechanical patterning; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density is high—each sentence does double duty (e.g., “powder is her medium, but also her method”). One paraphrase-loop appears—“the mirage of safety lingered, but she knows better. Safety is an illusion”—costing −0.2. Mixed metaphor count zero; no register drift. Clean copy, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, character, and world (“The brass gear…hummed…like a trapped heartbeat”). One paraphrase loop is flagged (“His hands bled, his back ached, but he didn’t stop”). Metaphors stay coherent—gear as heartbeat, sediment as memory—without mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective stacking (“abrasive calm, a razor wrapped in silk”) is purposeful and pattern-taught, so the overwriting check is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent—library “breathes,” rosette “spins”—without mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated diction (“relic,” “etched,” “braid”) fits Clara’s music-teacher lexicon. One paraphrase loop: “vanishing arts” concept restated three times; minor but noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean: zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is sparse but precise (“sculpture of light and life”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges graffiti motif. One near-mixed metaphor: “synaptic plasticity” applied to plant neurology—acceptable within speculative frame and pre-signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary naturally. Occasional scaffold—“It wasn’t the object itself that intrigued her; it was the way…”—repeats without new pressure. Mixed metaphors rare; “hush wasn’t emptiness; it was potential” lands cleanly. Filter verbs light; most description is anchored via tactile placement. Minor synonym drift around “quiet/hush/silence” but never clouds causality; closure beat is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lean; high info density: “threaded her fingers into the fissures” does tactile and action work simultaneously. Minor scaffold: “garden’s true purpose: not a tomb, but a laboratory” is useful compression, not redundancy. Mixed metaphor check clean; no filter-verb stacks. Final third avoids figurative muddle; one “shuddered, as if breathing” is earned, not strained. Overall momentum breathes with scene tempo, qualifying for 9-band but for isolated ornamental phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: each sentence advances setting, object lore, or interiority. No scaffold loops; sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts create visual rhythm. Mixed-metaphor risk (“aged parchment” stone, “tarnished silver” eyes) is minor and does not recur in climactic beat. Figurative language retreats during rupture, giving clarity. Copy accuracy clean. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line offers resonant image recharging dice motif.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid yet leans on decorative metaphor strings (“orchids bloomed like defiant lips,” “brush…fanned like a starfish”) that slightly dilute climax beats. No template cadence or synonym loops, but density of figurative language in final third holds the piece below 7.0. Sentence rhythm varies, paragraph cuts are clean; small tightenings would lift propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is fluid, readable aloud, with purposeful paragraph variation and strong verb choice (“seeped,” “refracted,” “smudged”). One minor paraphrase loop: “The thaw had begun” echoed twice within four lines (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density high—each sentence advances emotional or sensory layer. Closure image untouched by clutter. Would benefit from pruning two adjectives (“emerald-tinted,” “crystalline”) to let nouns stand naked.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or mechanism; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors are spare—“beam slicing fog like a blade”—and do not congest the high-pressure beat. Rhythm accelerates with compound sentences during flare, then cuts to single-clause triumph. One mixed image: “radiance piercing fog like a star” contradicts “devouring darkness inward”; minor, but nicks peak clarity. Copy is clean, typos absent.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences vary in length to match pulse. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“repulsive allure,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges toward thesaurus territory but stays within Mara’s aestheticized gaze. One scaffold clause (“the thing before her was a grotesque mosaic…”) could trim without loss. Otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: each sentence layers map, body, myth. Figurative language disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no purple drift. Rhythm varies: long clause for discovery, staccato for collapse. Only minor scaffold: “the sound grew louder” repeats concept of escalation; doesn’t touch closure, so stays within 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; information density high—one sentence often layers sensory detail, historical inference, and forward motion. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“ivy-choked archway”). Paragraph cut test passes: every graf advances knowledge or charge. A lone template cadence in the final smile line keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: single sentences fuse action, setting, interior—“She unscrewed the inkwell, dipped a quill, and began to write on a scrap of parchment: The drawbridge rises, but the water holds secrets.” No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (liquid amber, ghostly architecture). One near-overwrite: “hushed blaze of the setting sun gilded” nudges purple but serves tonal charge; does not obscure causality. Final line earns its lift.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “stamp’s weight…felt heavier, a silent plea” performs triple duty—tactile, symbolic, foreshadow. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor disciplined (“dappled resolve” re-illuminated at end). Opening and closing lines act as brackets, propelling entry and exit. One mixed vehicle (“blackout crept like thief”) is cliché-adjacent but isolated; does not touch closure, so penalty minor.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density: "polish until the stone weeps" does image + method + emotional bleed. No synonym loops; metaphors consistent (light, folding, flight). Minor scaffold—"the lantern maker…" repeated opening three sentences—dulls slightly but never touches closure; still below 9 due to that micro-repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; short bursts during node entry, longer coils for crater descent. Information density high—“veins of light stretching into the horizon” does triple work. Minor scaffold: “the hunt wasn’t over. It had just begun” is paraphrase; “she felt alive” is label-speak. No metaphor clash; visuals stay coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: every sentence advances image or causality. No loops or scaffold; metaphor is sparse and precise—“crown of shadows.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line crystallizes without flourish: “Now we listen.” Register stays consistent; no corporate drift. Closure beat is unmarred by artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templated cadence. High density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, motive, and object. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“guilt pulsed beneath his ribs like barnacles”—but it clears quickly and does not touch closure. Minor over-modification in dusk paragraph could trim 10 words, keeping score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “stones pitted by decades of salt and regret” fuses world + emotion. No loops; metaphor fields stay coherent (storm/sea/edge). Passive “was traded” is the only soft verb beat, instantly justified by Clara’s forced passivity in ritual exchange. Closure line—“she walked through it, her steps steady”—lands with crisp, unadorned release.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is tight: every sentence advances image or decision, no scaffold. Metaphors are sensory, not mixed (“seagull screeched… merrily melancholic, like a lullaby in a minor key” holds). One paraphrase loop: “She’d spent years gravitating toward safety, toward the paths others had paved” — “toward” repetition is deliberate cadence but still scans as template; minor. Opening and closing images (compass on railing, town lights) frame without echo-fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is compact, high-density; most lines advance image or motive. Metaphors are spare—“bioluminescent algae swirled like drowned stars”—and do not crowd peak beats. One scaffold trace: “She didn’t know if she believed… but for the first time… she felt something akin to hope” layers three hedge clauses. Otherwise clean; no loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathe-able: “scent clung to her skin like a second layer of flesh” does sensory + metaphor + consequence in one stroke. No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors; “dormant hearts” is precise because ash-embers literally pulse. Filter verbs used only when voice-motivated (“she understood”). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, no explain-everything capitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is patterned—crack as question mark, tree as hourglasses—without overwriting. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“unfastened,” “billowing,” “swallowed”) carry motion. One mixed metaphor (“fabric pooling like ink” vs. “ink staining skin”) is minor and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences multi-task (“She closed her eyes and let the memories wash over her—not just her own, but the ship’s”). One paraphrase loop (“long-dried tears on faded photographs” echoed twice) deducts −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no register drift. Rhythm accelerates into the final paragraph without artifact touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, readable, low on scaffolding; sentences advance moment-to-moment. Two minor loops: “angles… they’re a” echoed in back-to-back lines; “the cradle of sparks wasn’t a place but a idea” grammar slip. Metaphors are spare, avoiding density clog. Information density adequate; opening hooks, final line lands. No artifacts near closure; stays within 9- band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences multi-task (action + atmosphere + math reference) without scaffold. One mixed-metaphor risk—“star dust screamed”—but the personification is brief and pattern-consistent. No loops, no filler; paragraph cuts are clean. High-band ear-test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: timer’s red heartbeat doubles as metaphor and tool; envelope sheet is “singed”—one word carries burn risk and legacy. Metaphor chain (storm=beast, clouds=mercury) stays coherent, no mixed vehicles. Minor template cadence in “When masks slip… When scars speak…” but it’s pattern-driven, paid off. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, few filters, but metaphor strings in opening paragraph (“prismatic shadows… obsession with light”) verge on overwriting. No loops or scaffold; sundial angle mechanics stay precise. Closure line “And that, Kael thought, was the point all along” is tidy but not artifactual.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “trench coat, patched with mismatched fabric, flapped like a moth’s wings” does triple duty (visual, tactile, character state). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Figurative language spikes in calm beats, clears space during quill stroke, so never clutters closure. Metaphors internally consistent (moth / decay / light). Clean grammar; pronoun chain unambiguous after Marla enters. Final line crisp, image-driven, no filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean and musical, with only one scaffold loop (“the compass… the compass…”) and no mixed metaphors; sentences vary in length to mimic tide-pull without drumbeat monotony. Occasional poetic elevation (“diffuse the tides through instructions woven into an antique lace pattern”) is justified by the story’s lyric register and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “entropy had reclaimed order,” “dust blurred the lines between life and decay.” Figurative language is coherent (stellar metaphors applied to botanical decay) and peaks without muddle. Minor redundancy in “gradual change” phrasing (lines 12 and 28) triggers a −0.2 loop penalty, but no scaffold or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy. Final line (“evolved her”) risks abstraction but earns it through accumulated specificity. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph cuts serving emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “charcoal smuggler’s ledger strip, half-buried... edges frayed as if gnawed by time” conveys history, texture, and mystery in one phrase. Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose—but “trapped auroras” and “ancient ribs” slightly verge on familiar lyricism. Minor scaffold in “She would return... Instead, she’d craft...” could tighten. No loops or register drift; sentence variety supports momentum. Closure image remains undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “walls glazed with ice that refracted the dim glow” establishes atmosphere, character history, and thematic tension in one phrase. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “unshaken marvels” repetition (three mentions), but it’s motif-driven, not scaffold. No loops or filter-verb stacks; every line advances plot, character, or texture. Final line (“utterly alive”) resonates without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “glass fractured like a spider’s web” does double duty (image + foreshadowing). Sentence rhythm varies—short staccato during descent, flowing in library scenes—without monotony. One minor flaw: “bioluminescent ink” slightly overwrites, but payoff in floating books justifies it. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances character, setting, or stakes. Final line (“permanent address”) recharges the opening coffin promise.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and efficient, with high information density (“hope frayed like old rope,” “movements as quiet as the amplified quiet”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor flaw: “sanctioned moon” risks obscurity—“censored” or “forbidden” might clarify—but its poetic ambiguity serves tone. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; figurative language is coherent and sparse in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “petals glowing faintly as if lit from within” leans decorative, and “foggy lucidity” risks abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “revealing what was hidden” followed by “sought to heal, not just document.” Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“petals unfolded in slow-motion symphonies,” “breeze that tasted of salt and regret”) but avoids overwriting in high-pressure beats. Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates during disintegration. Minor flaw: slight redundancy in describing the fragment’s pulse (“pulsed faintly,” “edges biting”) and two adjacent lines summarizing time’s fraying. Otherwise, high information density, strong verbs, and zero scaffolding or loops mar the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “feathers dyed in hues of twilight, their quills wrapped in copper wire” conveys map, beauty, and function). Sentence variety supports tension, though three adjacent sentences begin with “The...” during scavenger approach (minor template cadence). No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (cotton candy as ghost, seeds as starlight). Final burst of light could risk purple prose but is earned by buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative (“aurora’s neon glow—a spectral light that seeped through the fractured roof like liquid mercury”), with strong verbs and selective sensory layering. Sentence openings vary, and paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in the climax (“scream of glass shattering, of promises unraveling”)—a mixed metaphor that slightly blurs causality. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near redundancy: “residual warmth of forgotten fires” followed by “ashes and regret.”

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gloves slick with sweat” advances character and atmosphere; “prismatic haze that short-circuited the grate’s lock” fuses action and image. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light motifs) and payoff-driven (wilted lily = cost). Minor redundancy in “quietly savvy” repetition (lines 4 and 24), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“footsteps fading… beacon… hummed”) varies sentence length to echo departure and lingering presence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“drip of melting ice... echoing like a ticking clock” establishes sound, time pressure, and decay). Syntax varies purposefully—fragments for tension, flowing clauses for reflection. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. One mixed metaphor: “ghost of a system” clashes with the room’s tangible ice/dust, causing slight coherence drag. Otherwise, figurative language is controlled and payoff-driven (e.g., “bubble trapped in molten glass” prefigures the bookmark’s crack).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “pages yellowed like old wounds,” “gun glinting” convey mood and threat efficiently. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., post-creak freeze). One paraphrase loop: “phobias screamed, but she stood” echoes earlier “hands shook,” but serves escalation. Figurative density peaks appropriately in climax (“whisper now a roar”), avoiding muddle. Final line resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “stone teeth gnawing at the wind” conveys setting, threat, and metaphor in one image. Sentence openings vary (“Mara…”, “The air…”, “Tonight…”, “She unwrapped…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence—e.g., the single-line “The fort’s walls groaned” punctuates intrusion. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“silence that thrummed with potential energy”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Final line’s “silence would wait, patient and infinite” recharges the opening hush with earned resonance, avoiding purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and efficient, with high information density (“droplets freezing mid-air and reforming into new shapes—a key, a lock, a door”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Overwriting appears briefly in “fractal, repeating in layers, each iteration slightly altered”—redundant modifiers—but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s “mundane mysticism” risks abstraction but is anchored by broom/bench actions. No scaffold loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “breath visible in the chilled air,” “vibrations resonating in Elias’s chest.” Sentences vary rhythmically, balancing short beats with flowing description. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the climax (“canvas,” “brushstrokes”) risks purple prose, but it’s grounded in Elias’s perceptual shift. No loops, redundancies, or scaffold—every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“coaxing,” “redirecting,” “recalibrate”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in “withered vine dresser” repetition and one paraphrase loop (“mend what’s broken… let them tell the story”). No scaffold or template cadence; rhythm supports pressure. Final line (“bloomed—not in spite of its wounds, but because of them”) is resonant without purple prose. Figurative language is coherent (marbles as ledger, maze as question mark).

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “mechanically warm precision” conveys both tactile detail and character attitude. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“time itself stretch, thinning like taffy”). Minor scaffold in “her mind racing with the director’s words” slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops or register drift. Final line (“she smiled”) earns its quiet closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density (“sheet music floating like lost confessions,” “strings glistening like spider silk”). Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent metaphors (“spider silk” / “wordless conversation”), but clarity holds. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. No loops, scaffolding, or register drift—every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “steel barnacle,” “mustache like frost,” “swallowed truth” avoid purple excess while anchoring metaphor in physicality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language intensifies purposefully toward climax (roots “clawing into paper’s fibers”). Final paragraph’s rhythm breathes with earned calm, resolving cadence without slackening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “mouth choked with ivy,” “hush that followed a sudden confession—a pause so thick it felt like a living thing.” Syntax varies effectively; paragraph cuts heighten rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “raw and gaping” followed by “cover-up… buried” slightly redundantly summarizes the truth. Figurative language is restrained in peak beats; no overwriting. Final line (“too heavy to carry”) cleanly echoes the opening “weight of a swallowed truth.”

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“shelves sagging under unread truths” implies both setting and stakes). Figurative language is coherent (library as “labyrinth of catacombs,” silence “seeping into bones”) with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “fractured black”/“stagnant water” pool description slightly blurs cause/effect, but closure image (“river flowed on, unburdened”) remains sharp. Zero paraphrase loops; syntactic variety maintains rhythm without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose avoids overwriting: figurative language is selective (“roots twisting like ancient veins”) and payoff-driven (curl’s glow echoes “sun’s light trapped inside”). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—longer cadences pre-eclipse, staccato during climax (“Mara’s eyes flew open”). One minor redundancy: “hummed with anticipation” and “air hummed” in adjacent paragraphs. No scaffold loops or register drift; closure beat remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “steel ribs rusting into the earth like the bones of a forgotten god”). Figurative language is coherent—dragons flee, walls retain memories—and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “bronze quiet” repeated twice, but rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s hum and unfurling wings land with clarity, no scaffold or loops marring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “beam carved through fog like a silver blade” establishes voice and stakes immediately. Sentences vary rhythmically; paragraphs breathe with scene needs. One paraphrase loop (“manipulate without interference… altering courses”) and slightly strained metaphor (“roots twisting through governments”) incur small penalties. Final lines avoid scaffold, landing on resonant image (“game was afoot”) that echoes opening cadence without repetition. High information density throughout—no wasted lines.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “constellations of hidden circuits,” “shadows that danced like dervishes” verge on mixed metaphor. Sentence openings vary well, but two adjacent lines restate the function of silence (“absence of noise” / “absence of silence”) without added pressure—a paraphrase loop costing clarity. No scaffold or register drift, but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“words curling like smoke,” “air thrummed”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “fractured through prismatic walls,” “glowing faintly, as if echoing the lake’s icy breath,” and “symphony, unheard but felt” verge on stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but three adjacent figurative descriptions near the opening flirt with density overload. Closure beat remains clear, so penalty is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“shimmered,” “fractured,” “crumbled”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in “procedural generation of her own life”—slightly academic for POV—but quickly grounded by sensory detail. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors earned stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “filament of hush” does thematic, sensory, and plot work. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—staccato for action, flowing for introspection. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors (“palimpsest of emotion”) are coherent and grounded. Minor overwriting in “ghostly whispers—a filament of hush” slightly strains clarity, but peak beats remain legible. Final line (“found her voice”) resonates without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “ash instead of rain” conveys anomaly, setting, and foreshadowing in four words. Syntax varies purposefully—complex sentences for reflection (“To nurture integrity…”), fragments for tension (“No sirens, no crowds—just silence”). One minor artifact: “credibly curious” slightly abstracts motive, though immediately grounded in map cross-referencing. Final paragraph’s “quietest places often held the loudest truths” risks near-profundity but earns it through concrete buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“silver vapor rose, twisting like a ghost”) and avoids redundancy. Sentence openings vary (“Inside, Lirael…”; “She’d learned…”; “The scent hit her…”), and paragraphs shift length to mirror emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “tapestry of inherited sorrow” slightly drifts into abstraction, but closure remains sharp. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“painted,” “peeled,” “vibrate”) and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful but borders on overuse in high-pressure beats (“knots of fear,” “tapestry of time”); one mixed metaphor (“loom of existence” vs. “tapestry”) triggers minor coherence drag. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with explanatory phrasing (“The texture of time...”), dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glass cathedral among rusted shipwrecks” establishes tone economically, and metaphors cohere (silence as wall/threshold, music as unbinding). Minor overwriting in “chronic hush that softened the edges of ruin” slightly strains, but figurative language serves theme. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and structure. Final paragraph’s “light in the ash” risks cliché but is redeemed by concrete antecedents (charred twig, warm bowl).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “air hummed with the static charge of dusk’s first sigh” establishes tone and motif economically. Figurative language is consistent (amber, static, scent as emotion) without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“professionally thorough nature demanded…”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines breathe rhythmically, echoing opening cadence to close the textural arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “heels crunching gravel” establishes sound and status; “paper-scented calm” merges setting and mood. Minor overwriting in “stormy concerto” (slightly generic) and “whimsically attentive ambiance” (adverb-heavy), but figurative language pays off—the fan’s breeze delivers the envelope and stirs “whispers of old stories,” linking mechanics to theme. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence (“fan still turned… cycle turned anew”) echoes opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and dense (“air hums with ghosts of unspoken dialects”), with strong verbs and specific nouns. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light = connection) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“fractured rainbows across the soil”) slightly stalls momentum, but propulsion returns quickly. No loops or scaffold; final line (“a thread connecting two hearts”) resonantly recharges the central motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid yet precise: “waves moved backward, then forward, then sideways” conveys chaos economically. Figurative language is purposeful (“silver serpent,” “diver through syrup”) without muddle. Minor density in the tunnel description slightly slows momentum, but sentence variety maintains propulsion. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“some stories weren’t meant to be told in a single breath”) perfectly recharges the cadence motif.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“dripping stalactites fed the soil” establishes setting and causality). Figurative language is pattern-taught (fractals, mosaics, starlight) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in one beat (“gently inventive, she’d devised a ritual”) slightly dulls immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates toward climax (“The orchard’s air hummed… trees shuddered… fruit pulsing”) then resolves in quiet poise, with zero artifacts obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“staining the air a sapphire hush,” “laughter, brittle as glass”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light, sound, texture) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “ghost in her mind” and “labyrinth of pipe chases” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors opening, creating resonant propulsion without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “damp fibers clinging like a second skin” advances atmosphere and character. Sentence rhythm varies effectively—longer clauses for reflection, staccato phrases for tension (“It’s reconstructing. By releasing control.”). One minor overwriting lapse: “storm season’s breath thick and electric” edges toward purple, but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line serves momentum, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “cliffs crumbled under the moon’s indifferent gaze,” “sea’s breath seeped through cracks,” “mud that smelled of iron and decay.” Figurative language is coherent (light/water/painting motifs) and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold in “chaotic swirl of blues and grays, mocked her… lacked the *something*” slightly redundantly conveys frustration. Otherwise, high information density, varied syntax, and momentum sustained through tactile verbs and selective detail.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “shadows that danced across the walls” does setting, mood, and foreshadowing. Sentence variety supports cadence shifts (long flowing lines for cave description, staccato for climax). One paraphrase loop: “overlapping shadows” repeated three times in close proximity slightly dulls impact. Figurative coherence holds—light/shadow motifs never contradict—but “teeth like polished onyx” feels slightly ornamental amid otherwise integrated imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise: “boots tapping a hollow rhythm,” “fractured like shattered glass.” Sentences vary in length and propulsion, matching scene tempo. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One near-miss: “reactively visionary” appears as label without immediate dramatization, but context clarifies. Final paragraph’s “mosaic… symphony” metaphor risks abstraction but is grounded by the physical trumpet. High information density; every image serves atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “breath fogging the cold air” conveys temperature, physiology, and mood. Figurative language is purposeful (“mist clung… like breath of a sleeping giant”) without muddle.

    Prose is dense with purpose: “breath fogging the glass” establishes chill and immediacy; “quill scratching through forgotten patterns” merges tool and theme. Figurative language is restrained yet potent (“songs meant for ears long gone”). Minor redundancy in “sculpt space for reflection” echoed later, but no scaffold loops. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors whale songs—lulling yet precise—earning its lyricism without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “jagged shadows that danced like spies” advances atmosphere and foreshadows intrusion; “gravity pulled sideways” conveys spatial mutiny economically. Minor overwriting in “hushed thunder of the storm carrying them”—slightly mixed register—but no loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony. Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates then resolves cleanly. Information density high: nearly every line serves character, setting, or stakes without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and efficient, with high information density (“lilies and ironed linen” establishes setting and theme in five words). Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for reflection, staccato beats during tension. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are consistent (ink as mood ring, breach point). One slight overwriting: “liquefying rigid thinking” edges toward abstraction but is grounded immediately by action. Final line resonates without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “pages were a patchwork of parchment, graph paper, and even a few scraps of old banknotes” conveys history, craft, and economy in one line. Figurative language is pattern-taught (textures → time → tapestry) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “She believed that every texture… held a story”—slightly tell-y—but immediately dramatized by her writing. Final paragraph’s cadence (“persisted, her incandescent restraint guiding…”) crystallizes tone without redundancy. No loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “steel mountains,” “shadows stretching and shrinking like living things” serve atmosphere and theme. Sentence variety avoids monotony; paragraph cuts align with emotional shifts. Minor overwriting in “ink that smudged like tears”—a slight cliché—but compensated by strong verbs (“clawed,” “ripping,” “pry”). No loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or texture. Closure image (“staring into the harbor’s black mouth”) resonates without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dust motes swirled in the slanting light of a dying sun” establishes atmosphere while advancing time. Figurative language is coherent (observatory as “fossilized question,” note as “memory trying to reform”). Minor overwriting in “resonant hums to retell” slightly softens causality, but no loops or scaffold dilute momentum. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic release—long sentences dissolving like wind-carried notes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fried dough and diesel,” “eyes replaced by dollar signs,” “edges smooth from handling” all do double duty. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during planning (“Over the next week…”), pausing at closure. Minor overwriting in “tapestry of demands” risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate concrete grounding (“Every symbol… has a purpose”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances character, conflict, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“the summit’s airless chill seeped through her suit, but she ignored it”). Figurative language is restrained yet potent (“mirror reflecting humanity’s fleeting presence”). Minor overwriting in “luminescent gas that danced above the crater”—“danced” slightly anthropomorphizes—but doesn’t obscure clarity. Sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence, and the final line (“quiet, persistent truth in the archives of time”) recharges the premise without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “mist clung like a second skin,” “iridescence flashing like liquid sunlight”—metaphors serve theme and character. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with action (short during soldering, longer in reflection). One minor slip: “rhythmic clatter of the lift’s chains” slightly contradicts later “creaks harmonizing,” but not enough to obscure causality. No loops, scaffolding, or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “streak of gray against the iron sky,” “hissed as it melted snow.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (condensation → rivers → light) and pays off without muddle.

Final line’s falcon laugh resonates without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “ivy clawed at weathered stone,” “bells muffled by rust,” “dust settled into neat patterns” do triple duty (image, sound, theme). Figurative language is consistent—sound as lifeblood—and never muddles causality. Minor redundancy in “crumbling wall”/“skeleton” arch description, but rhythm varies purposefully. Final paragraph’s cadence (“not with hammers… but with patience”) echoes the story’s ethos without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “algae-slick stone,” “symbols that shifted like liquid”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“unsnarl” applied to whispers, then voices) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in the memory surge (“crown she’d never worn”) edges toward the ornamental, and one near-paraphrase (“hush wasn’t empty—it pulsed…”) slightly dulls momentum, but no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is precise: “scuffs gnawing at the wood like teeth,” “laughter like shattering glass,” and “wind through a keyhole” avoid mixed metaphors while advancing atmosphere. Paragraphs vary rhythmically, and every line serves multiple functions (e.g., “copperlight repose” conveys mood, setting, and thematic residue). Minor figurative density in mid-section (“mosaic of memory and myth”) borders on ornamental but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift mars the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “gown woven from threads of a thousand funerals” conveys history, texture, and sorrow in one phrase. Rhythm varies purposefully—long sentences for atmosphere, staccato for climax. Minor overwriting in “spectral iridescence” and “latent magic” slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops or scaffold mar clarity. Final line (“laughter lingered—a sound of mournful elation”) resonates without redundancy, repaying the opening’s tone.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“paths once sacred now crumbled, symbols once revered now faded”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (thread as question mark, labyrinth as nervous system) and paid off in the glowing seams. Minor overwriting in the opening (“exhausted eyes” + “sunken” + “glassy” in one clause) risks purple prose, but clarity holds. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors dawn’s arrival—light, ascending, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots twisting like serpents through ribcages” does setting, character, and theme work. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“The trees…”, “She carried…”, “On her third day…”). Figurative language is coherent (roots as listeners, shrine as heartbeat). Minor overwriting in “faint, resonant energy”—“resonant” slightly redundant—but no artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “cobblestone floors,” “kinetic energy from her footsteps,” “wax seal—a phoenix rising” each advance setting, character, and plot. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph cuts align with emotional beats. One minor flaw: “futuristic nostalgia wasn’t about clinging to the past—it was about reinventing it” edges toward thematic statement, though embedded in Lira’s realization. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “needles darted like comets” conveys motion, sound, and metaphor). Figurative language is pattern-taught early (dust constellations, luminescent threads) and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots clawed at the sky like ancient fingers” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is coherent (water droplets as tears, songs like church bells) and peaks without muddle. Minor redundancy in “fierce tenderness” phrasing slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“And so she did”) resolves with rhythmic closure, echoing earlier motifs without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“The coral’s grooves mirrored the smudged pencil marks…” links object, memory, and theme).

Final line (“the ocean whispered back”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “moss-choked paths,” “laughter echoing through the orchard as if amplified by the fog itself.” Figurative language is purposeful, not purple—light “weaving strands of color” ties to her method.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Strong verbs (“pulsed,” “coax,” “pry”) and concrete nouns (“crumbling mural,” “fractal wind chime”) avoid abstraction. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“fissures split wider, revealing…”) leans slightly purple but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Final line (“forever curious”) lands with earned simplicity after rich texture.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “beetles marched in time to the seed’s vibrations” merges action, rhythm, and theme. Sentence variety supports momentum—short bursts for tension (“He grinned.”), flowing clauses for description. Minor overwriting in “fractal shadows on the walls” (slightly redundant after “fractal patterns” on seed), but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“The warp had just begun”) resonates without summarizing, closing on active ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “bioluminescent tides painted the air in hues of reef-shadow joy” does atmosphere, setting, and tone in one stroke. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate breath. One minor slip: “reef-shadow joy” slightly strains as compound modifier, but payoff in final line (“ensconced in the arms of the sea”) redeems it. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every line advances character, conflict, or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every line advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language (“museum of extinct feelings,” “bamboo that vanished when the last rainforest sighed”) is coherent and purposeful.

Closure image (“library hummed back”) recharges opening motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “shelves sagging under leather-bound dictionaries” conveys weight, age, and neglect in seven words. Figurative language is purposeful (“silence between her and her estranged sister became a chasm”) without purple excess. Minor scaffold appears in “carefully reckless nature had led her here—to this dim, mothball-scented vault—before paths diverged,” where the em-dash clause slightly paraphrases prior context. Sentence openings vary (“The extinct language archive hummed…” / “Dr. Elara Voss… adjusted…” / “Her carefully reckless nature…”), maintaining momentum. No loops or artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—most lines multitask (e.g., “its arches trembling as the building breathed” establishes setting, rhythm, and metaphor). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“dappled resolve shimmering like volcanic glass”) risks slight register drift, but not enough to obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes earlier motifs without redundancy. One near-paraphrase (“fragile trust between strangers” / “secrets a little safer”) barely dents momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dust motes swirled in the sunlight like tiny galaxies” does atmosphere, character, and motif in one. Sentence openings vary (“Elias adjusted…”, “He’d trained…”, “The attic doubled…”), paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence.

Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“She kept walking”) delivers resonant closure without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“charred edges a reminder of fire’s fleeting dance”). Sentence variety supports rhythm—complex constructions for wonder, fragments for awe (“The researchers gasped”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“ancient and alive,” “lonely, beautiful work”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “shadowseam wonder” risks neologism strain, yet earns it through accumulated texture. Read-aloud cadence is fluid, with strong verbs and specific nouns anchoring abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or thematic pressure. Figurative language is coherent (“regret… like molasses left too long in the sun”) and rarely overloads. Minor scaffold appears in “She believed the seeds held a map…” followed by near-restatement, but momentum holds. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with emotional cadence. Final paragraph’s clarity and restraint elevate rather than obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “neon signs flickering like nervous fish” establishes tone, setting, and metaphor in one stroke.

    High information density: “moss that pulsed like a second heartbeat” conveys setting, character, and theme. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“celestial cloak,” “cosmos itself held its breath”—edges toward purple but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure image (“heart full of obsidian grace”) is clear, though “obsidian grace” slightly abstract. One paraphrase near climax (“shedding of the self to make room for the infinite” / “liberation”) costs 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative, with strong verbs (“bled,” “pooled,” “glistening”) and varied sentence openings. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “tapestry of colors—blues and greens and hints of amber—all dancing in the mist” leans purple, and “noctilucent reckonings” introduces jargon. No paraphrase loops, but the phrase “read between lines” recurs without deepening. Final paragraph’s “clear complexity” borders on abstract, slightly dulling closure’s sensory punch.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)

Final line (“Elara listened”) achieves perfect cadence: quiet, charged, and resonant with all prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in “walls choked with vines that had grown bold” slightly strains metaphor coherence, but the cost doesn’t dull closure. No loops or scaffold—each image accrues meaning. Final line (“The corridor’s echo had found its voice”) perfectly echoes the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but fluid: “colors bleed where her touch distorted the light” does triple duty. Minimal overwriting—figurative language is pattern-taught (refraction, sound-as-weave) and pays off. One slight redundancy: “perceptively calm” appears twice, though second use reinforces endurance. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors fading resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with strong information density—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes—but contains minor overwriting: “slow dance of celestial bodies” appears twice with identical phrasing, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “ghost” moon and “bridge” shadow verge on mixed metaphor. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final paragraph’s cadence resonates, but the repeated celestial motif dulls propulsion slightly in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (“a relic of a species wiped out by the drought he’d engineered”). Figurative language is controlled—salt as “confetti,” cracks as “ancient scripts”—without muddle.

Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the theme without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: metaphors (“threads of forgotten memories,” “loom, her limbs the shuttle”) serve theme and action. However, figurative density borders on overwriting in mid-dance (“alarming serenity… vacuum waiting to be filled”), slightly dulling propulsion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “prismatic shadows,” “shards,” “hues,” “cascade of light” risk synesthetic saturation. Final paragraph regains clarity, though “harvest of echoes” repeats without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“piercing the dusk,” “unraveling of assumptions”) and purposeful figurative density. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “half-lit epiphanies” appears twice in close proximity without added pressure. Final beat avoids scaffold—closure image (stick’s warmth, stars) earns resonance. No register drift or syntactic monotony; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“mist curled like spun sugar and the air tasted of dew and distant thunder”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting: “geometric shadow, a map of loss and hope” leans slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete imagery. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent. Final beat (“moth’s spirit would smile”) risks sentimentality but is earned by preceding restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “braids coiled like a serpent,” “melody—a lullaby...name erased.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/memory motifs) and payoff-earned.

Final line (“light reconfigured from memory”) perfectly echoes opening, closing the cadence without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but risks overwriting in peak beats (e.g., “laughter weaving through the rewilded forest” leans decorative). Minor scaffold in “She’d always believed… but now she saw” could be dramatized. Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; the bergamot-and-iron scent and vine motifs pay off without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lantern’s flicker casting elongated shadows” advances atmosphere and character. Figurative language is pattern-taught (shifting grids, bioluminescence) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “dusky harmony” repetition (lines 4 and 28), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“The covenant was sealed”) resonates without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful (“heart soft as moss,” “time bending like taffy”), with strong sentence variation and paragraph pacing. However, recurring phrases like “the pin vanished, only to reappear” create minor paraphrase loops, and “shifting grace” appears as label-speak without concrete embodiment. The cellular memory explanation feels expository (“harvested from her own blood”) rather than dramatized. No fatal artifacts, but the final paragraph’s “grace had shifted” slightly dulls the closure image by restating the concept instead of trusting the pin-in-hand visual.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “twilight frost… clung to skeletal branches like a second skin”). Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph cuts align with ritual beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One near-overwriting: “molten glass into new molds” slightly generic, but compensated by visceral details elsewhere (“oil[ing] gears with liquid that smelled of midnight and memory”). Final line (“space between breaths”) perfectly echoes opening, earning lyrical payoff without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“roots had clawed through stone to claim the sky”). Figurative language is purposeful, not excessive, and sentence openings vary. However, a faint paraphrase loop appears: “mend not just quartz eyes but the fractures” / “mended more than quartz.” Also, “liquid starlight” risks register drift but is earned by context. Closure beat remains clear; artifacts don’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “pollen from a pistachio shell cameo blank” establishes texture economically. Figurative language is purposeful—“roots anchored in soil that pulsed with a faint, blue glow” ties biology to cosmos. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She’d been summoned…”, “As she stood…”, “Elara inquired…”). Minor artifact: “fractal of possibilities” edges toward jargon but is immediately grounded by tactile shell comparison. Closure beat (“warm, its patterns rearranged”) avoids purple prose while deepening mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and efficient, with strong verbs (“shelves shuddered,” “spine opening”) and sensory specificity. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“unheard symphony” opens and closes the piece). Minor overwriting in the spider beat (“hollow filled with live spiders” slightly redundant), and one paraphrase loop (“renegotiate their terms” / “renegotiated wisely”). No scaffold sentences or syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Final line’s cadence masterfully echoes the opening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “jagged teeth marks from her twin’s half-serpentine jaws” conveys history, relationship, and embodiment in one phrase. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer sentences for discovery, staccato for tension.

No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “gears groaned,” “shadows elongated,” “braids snapped into place” advance plot while enriching atmosphere.

Minor overwriting in “scent of aged parchment and iron” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final beam of light pierces cleanly—no muddle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“fingers traced the frost’s ridges, each groove a fossilized echo”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound as light, silence as bloom) and coherent, though “hammered repose” slightly strains metaphor logic. Minor scaffold in “She’d learned long ago…” could be tighter, but momentum never stalls. Final paragraph’s cadence (“duet of hush and hum”) perfectly resolves the opening’s harmonic premise without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “shattered panes rattled like skeletal wind chimes” establishes setting, tone, and decay in one phrase. Sentence openings vary (“In the glass…”, “Her name…”, “The collapse…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “fragile alchemy of hope and memory” risks abstraction but is anchored by preceding concrete action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gelatinous sheen coating spires in shimmer that made clouds look like poured milk” advances atmosphere and plot (distortion affects shadow measurements). Minimal artifacts—only slight overuse of “hush” (three times) near climax, but it serves tonal accumulation. Sentence variety avoids monotony; paragraph cuts align with emotional beats (e.g., post-evaporation reflection). Figurative language coheres: fog as breath/memory, identity as sculpture, all grounded in observatory’s physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stone walls cradling gardens of fire-lilies” establishes texture economically. Figurative language avoids muddle—flame “dances without smoke,” lilies “bloom violently” like fireworks. Minor redundancy in “ambient awareness” repetition, but no scaffold loops. Closure beat (“becoming fire”) resonates without overwriting. Sentence variety supports rhythm: short staccato phrases (“She knelt.”) amid lyrical flows.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with high information density (“tide’s breath painted the walls in silver,” “fermented, like seaweed in the sun”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence, and figurative language is coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “warmly observant of every detail” leans toward label, but quickly redeemed by concrete specifics. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; final lines resonate without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“wings of patience,” “silence heavier than stone”) and avoids redundancy. Sentence variety supports momentum: staccato countdown, fluid ascent, abrupt hatch closure. One paraphrase loop: “intangibly tangible” appears twice without added pressure. Figurative language is coherent (silence as edible, blanket, seed), though “xenial trellis” borders on over-compression. Final line resonates without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“water so clear it mirrored the terrace’s kaleidoscopic spires”). Figurative language is coherent—glass, prisms, fractals form a consistent motif system.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “frost-kissed grass,” “ozone and elderberries,” “paint flaked away like old skin” each advance setting, mood, and plot. Figurative language is purposeful but slightly dense in opening paragraph (“hologram trapped in time” risks abstraction). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure beat (“story to write… until next sunrise”) perfectly echoes inciting incident’s time pressure. One mixed metaphor: “thief” for time clashes with organic motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ashen charcoal sanctuary” conveys texture, tone, and theme in three words. Figurative language is restrained in high-pressure beats (e.g., “emptiness had become a cage” appears once, then embodied). Minor redundancy in “fading threshold” repetition, but it serves accumulative design. Final paragraph’s “loaded emptiness” crystallizes tone without purple prose. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively—short sentences for tension, longer for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “spores had been mutating into crystalline structures, sharp as regret” does triple duty (image, stakes, character). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, conflict, or character. Figurative language is coherent (pressure → diamonds → mist), and rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final line (“shadowseam wonder”) recharges the opening without redundancy, closing the cadence cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “golden shadows deepened, stretching across the floor like liquid gold” does atmosphere, character perception, and foreshadowing in one. Minimal scaffolding; every sentence advances plot, character, or mood. One slight overwriting risk (“sepia reading room swallowed the last sliver of sunlight”) but payoff justifies it. No loops, mixed metaphors, or filter-verb stacks; closure beat (“stepped into the golden shadows”) resonates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)

Final line propels closure with earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and varied, though one overwriting slip: “molten gold that seemed to swallow the horizon” leans purple. Otherwise, high information density—“bioluminescent glow of algae clinging to the walls” conveys setting, mood, and plot function. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Minor scaffold: “She’d been underestimated since birth…” slightly tells, but quickly grounds in action. No loops or artifacts in closure beat.

One minor paraphrase loop (“steady… steady”) slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold, filter stacks, or cadence runs mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (“moss-slick cave,” “leaves sharp as knives”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (swirling = uncertainty) and pays off in closure. Minor redundancy in “grinding his teeth” followed by “Uncertainly certain”—a near-paraphrase loop—but it’s brief and thematically functional. No scaffold sentences; every paragraph alters knowledge or charge. Final line’s simplicity (“It was a mirror”) earns its weight through prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain drummed… melancholic rhythm that matched the ache in Kael’s bones” establishes voice, setting, and emotion in one breath. Figurative language is purposeful—molten metal as cathedral, names as anchors—and avoids purple excess.

Final paragraph’s starkness (“hand closed on empty air”) delivers clean, resonant closure without clutter or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (veil, tooth, harp) and payoff-integrated; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “books flew from their shelves, their pages flapping like wings” does triple duty (action, image, theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (glass, light, sound motifs) and pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “prismatic shards that danced across the asteroid’s twisted spires” advances setting, character, and mood simultaneously. Minor overwriting in storm description (“howling maelstrom of cobalt and violet”) slightly blurs causality, but rhythm tightens at climax (“The scholars gasped—not at the light, but at the symbols”). Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final line resonates without scaffold: “Civilizations… built on the courage to see what mirrors hide.”

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “air thickening into syrup of sound” does atmosphere, emotion, and causality in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (resonance → hum → chord → note) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “needles of obsidian, threads of spun starlight, vial of liquid silence”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary; final line (“never been whole to begin with”) recharges opening creed with earned poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “resonant hush, the kind of silence that amplifies the smallest sound”). Figurative language is purposeful: petrichor “grew sharper, almost alive” foreshadows the lagoon’s sentience. Minor flaw: “Hinged awakenings” risks abstraction but is quickly grounded in physical action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentence variety supports cadence shifts from contemplation to awe.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “groaning like a creature caught between worlds” merges sound and metaphor economically. Sentence openings vary (“She pressed…”, “A flicker…”, “Lira was…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “turbine-hum reverie” risks abstraction but pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “autumn leaves clung… like fiery confetti” establishes tone without overwriting. Figurative language is purposeful—glass “hummed,” etchings “pulsed like heartbeats”—and coheres physically. Minor redundancy in “reckon through the hidden layers” / “only just begun to reckon” slightly dulls the final beat, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary (“Mara… knelt,” “She’d been commissioned,” “The abbey’s head nun…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional rhythm. Closure image (“autumn leaves fell once more”) resonates without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose shows high information density (“hull lined with bookshelves that seemed to defy gravity,” “bioluminescent fungi” chamber) without overwriting. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—longer during visions, clipped at climax (“Lead on.”). One minor artifact: “fraying at the edges” slightly cliché for identity loss, but redeemed by concrete follow-through (tears, blank pages). No loops or scaffold; closure image sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “lanterns flickered like half-forgotten dreams” merges atmosphere, metaphor, and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One minor flaw: “spectral echoes of a ghost town revival” slightly muddles temporality (are the echoes *of* revival or *preventing* it?), but clarity recovers instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or thematic pressure. Figurative language is controlled (“bruise-purple twilight,” “defiant green thumbprint”) and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy appears in “archive this pattern, too, adding it to the library of emotions”—a slight paraphrase loop—but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the garden’s pulse, and the final paragraph’s cadence lands with quiet authority. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“frost from the oak acorn cap cradled in her palm” establishes object, action, and reverence). Figurative language is pattern-taught (spirals, light, ice) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in “twin voids that swallowed the starlight”—slightly strained—but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line (“leaves unfurling like green flames”) recharges earlier motifs with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “frayed hemp,” “slick with years of neglect,” “fractal patterns” do double duty in atmosphere and causality.

Final paragraph’s cadence (“listening, always listening”) reprises motif without redundancy, closing with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density: “calloused from decades,” “primal elegance,” “flicker of something softer.” Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “fractured across the sky, its tail splitting into a dozen shimmering fragments” edges toward stacked modifiers, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; every image serves theme or character. Final line (“a woman who had learned to find strength in the act of letting go”) risks summary but lands because it reconfigures prior action, not replaces it.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely clean with strong sentence variety and purposeful rhythm. High information density: “skeletal reminder of life’s fragility” conveys setting, theme, and tone in one phrase. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“scorched wasteland stretched endlessly… sun that had forgotten mercy”) edges toward purple prose but serves voice. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; however, “tangled covenant” appears twice as abstract label without embodiment, slightly dulling thematic integration. Closure lines (“heart light,” “sighed… burden”) land cleanly without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled: “time losing its syntax,” “mercury stilled, forming a perfect sphere.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “mosaic of moments, each one fragile and infinite”—a near-cliché cadence that softens the final beat. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

Figurative language is pattern-taught (“bronze quiet” recurs) and payoff-earned (the quiet lingers post-revelation). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or pressure. Minor deduction for one slightly overwritten phrase (“liquid mercury” eyes)—evocative but bordering on stock—but clarity never falters, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hooves sinking into damp sand,” “sky bled from orange to indigo.” Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors or purple prose. Minor scaffold in “a skill honed in libraries where ancient texts whispered…” slightly abstracts, but quickly grounds in action. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One near-loop: “dead things could nourish new life” echoes later “coax life from death,” but accrues meaning rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“wind’s whispers,” “crackled like dry leaves”) and avoids redundancy. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“pierced,” “crept,” “unravel”) and sensory specificity. Figurative language is dense but coherent—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm accelerates during swaps. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “a fragment of light so pure it hurt to look at” verges on purple, and “sound of silence, captured in a tiny vial” risks abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“He’d expected resistance, but not this. The sky outside had darkened further…”) slightly paraphrase tension without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (sound as smoke, scars as memory) and peaks without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “platinum walls gleamed faintly, as if absorbing the faint light of a sun that hadn’t moved in decades” merges setting and theme. Varied sentence openings avoid monotony; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (memory shift, labyrinth center). One paraphrase loop: “fidgeted productively” then “fidgeted with his ring” slightly redundant. Figurative language is coherent (threads = emotions), though “woven hush” risks vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “towers of bone rose like crooked teeth against a bruised sky” establishes setting, tone, and metaphor in one breath). Figurative language is pattern-taught early and pays off—“kaleidoscope,” “lens,” “refract” all culminate in the spire’s light burst. Minor flaw: “the price of forgiveness was high… but he also knew” slightly tells rather than shows internal conflict. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or purple excess; every sentence earns its place. Final line (“learned how to see”) is strong but could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fumes eating the air like a thief,” “gears whirring like a mechanical heart.” Figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off (quilts → constellations → kintsugi).

Final line (“The proof was in the silence”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “rusted antennae clawing at the sky like skeletal fingers” establishes tone and stakes in one image. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor figurative density in the climax (“twisted monument to the dead and the lost”) borders on ornamental but pays off in the final spin. Sentence openings vary naturally; rhythm accelerates during building, breathes at sunrise. Closure image (“censer foot still spinning”) crystallizes without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“shuddered,” “tore,” “occlude”) and selective sensory detail. Opening line (“chandelier of green”) establishes voice and stakes efficiently. Minor overwriting in the first paragraph (“branches bent low under the weight of truffles” borders on mixed metaphor—truffles grow underground), and one paraphrase loop (“fragile kind of honesty, but it was a start” echoes prior sentiment). Final paragraph’s rhythm falters slightly with abstract phrasing (“felt hope”), but closure image remains potent.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “petals brittle as moth wings” conveys fragility and ephemerality in one stroke.

Minor overwriting in “nest of silver and seaweed” slightly strains metaphor, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line (“a child’s laughter waited to be reclaimed”) recharges the locket’s “someone else’s laughter” with earned resonance—zero artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“brittle as dried leaves,” “emerald shards”). Figurative language is restrained in peak beats—no purple prose during the vision. Sentence variety supports momentum, though one paraphrase loop occurs (“the map’s glimmer… golden light” then “glimmer intensified”). No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“cartographer of her own heart”) risks slight sentimentality but earns it through earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “cobalt grotto above clouds stretching like a bruise” establishes setting, tone, and metaphor in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (bleeding light → liquid silver → viscous pool) without muddle. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “pulse quickened” followed by “chest rising/falling in rhythm” slightly redundantly. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters with generic “cloak billowing,” but closure image (“hands glistening”) redeems specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but mostly purposeful: “glowing cracks weaving gold,” “sound like a thousand crickets waking” serve atmosphere and character. Minor overwriting in climax (“violet and crimson, swirling like a nebula”) slightly muddles focus. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively.

Figurative language is consistent (clocks as living systems, silence as measurable substance) and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold appears in “the pause between heartbeats? The space between one thought and the next?”—a slight paraphrase loop—but it’s brief and thematically functional. Rhythm varies naturally, and the final lines land with crystalline clarity. No artifacts obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid yet precise: “shimmering, semi-transparent field designed to keep pests out and humidity in” establishes function economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (barriers “breathe,” farm “hummed”) and pays off in closure (“permeability wasn’t vulnerability—it was strength”). Minor redundancy in “fractal shadows”/“fractal patterns” slightly dulls density, but rhythm varies purposefully—long sentences for wonder, staccato for tension. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)

    Prose is dense but propulsive: “ivy that pulsed like a second heartbeat” establishes rhythm without purple excess. Figurative language is coherent (bioluminescent graffiti as “ancient warnings,” shadows as “dervishes”) and escalates purposefully toward the climax. Minor flaw: “desperation” appears twice in close proximity (platform as “stage for his desperation,” later “materialized from the ivy” amid his desperation), creating slight synonym churn. Otherwise, syntax varies effectively—short staccato phrases during tension (“Minutes ticked by.”) contrast with flowing descriptions of the station’s decay.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “trees hummed in frequencies beyond human hearing,” “time pooled like mercury.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (vibration = communication) and pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“vintage camera with no film hanging around his neck” establishes object, history, and paradox in one phrase). Sentence rhythm modulates with scene intensity, and figurative language is coherent (harbor as liquid silver, silence as canvas). However, slight overwriting appears in “melody that captured the beauty of loneliness, the ache of things unsaid”—two near-synonymous abstractions in one clause. No loops or artifacts dull closure, but this minor redundancy prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “charred edges… smudge of soot and a single, unblinking eye” establishes mood, character, and mystery in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “bruised sky like a bruise on glass” avoids mixed metaphor by anchoring abstraction in physical sensation. Sentence openings vary (“Lira stood…”, “The dental mirror hung…”, “Her attribute was…”), and paragraph lengths breathe with scene rhythm. One minor slip: “spiralingly calm” borders on invented adverb, though context earns it. No loops, no scaffold—every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final image lands with zero fat.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences often multitask (e.g., “magnetite pieces trembled as if eager to move” conveys object, atmosphere, and anticipation). Figurative language is coherent—magnetic fields, seeds, forests form a unified motif—and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold appears in “messages about choice… seeing the board before the move,” slightly echoing earlier phrasing, but no loops or cadence fatigue. Final paragraph’s rhythm swells then stills, mirroring the grotto’s pulse, with zero simultaneity errors or filter-verb stacks.

No loops or scaffold; closure image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: “ice crystals hung… like suspended breath” advances atmosphere and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs breathe with scene needs.

Figurative coherence holds—quartz “sings,” ice “breathes”—without mixed metaphors. Final line (“into the unknown”) resolves with image, recharging earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose maintains high information density: “sunlight fractured through molten-glass orbs strung like lanterns” establishes setting, mood, and motif in one breath.

Final line (“the pilgrimage wasn’t over—it had just begun”) resonates without stating theme.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “time pooled like mercury,” “light spilled through cracks.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow motifs) and never muddled in peak beats. Minor scaffold in “crafted mourning jewelry—rings… pendants…” could tighten, but no loops or register drift. Final line (“Light the way”) resonates without redundancy. One near-paraphrase (“mending what others had lost” / “mending what cannot be unbroken”) costs 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glass dripped like a thousand inverted hourglasses” establishes motif while advancing atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (tape as serpent, rain as lens) and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold in “Their stories pooled... invisible threads waiting to be measured” slightly restates prior idea, but momentum recovers instantly with the knock. Sentence openings vary (“She’d always...”, “The skylight rattled...”, “Mara frowned...”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final line’s “listened” resonates without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: “dust motes… fleeting atom of nostalgia” merges image and concept efficiently.

Closure image (“hues ripple like a promise”) avoids purple prose through concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“frost crackled, releasing a hum that vibrated in her teeth”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled—ivy taps Morse code, sand swirls like a storm—without muddle or overwriting. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and momentum never stalls. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in “meteor hush,” which risks poetic vagueness over concrete resonance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “celluloid glinted under the flickering bulb” conveys light, texture, and instability in seven words. Sentence openings vary (“Mara’s gift…”, “She unwound…”, “For a moment…”), avoiding template cadence. One minor overwriting slip—“forgotten lyrics searching for a tune” leans slightly purple—but pays off tonally at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s “steps light” contrasts earlier “ache in her chest,” showing change without telling.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled: high information density, varied syntax, strong verbs (“loomed,” “shuddered,” “dissolved”). Figurative language is frequent but pattern-taught (celestial imagery throughout) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“symphony he’d never written, a painting… a poem”) edges toward stacked modifiers, slightly blurring focus. No loops or scaffold; final line (“chase the aurora again”) recharges the opening without redundancy. Read-aloud rhythm flows naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose balances lyric density with propulsion: “bioluminescent sand that pulsed like a heartbeat” does triple duty (setting, rhythm, motif). Sentence openings vary (“After...”, “Kael...”, “The air...”, “One evening...”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., post-clock discovery). Minor overwriting in “fractured lullaby of heat and light”—slightly abstract—but redeemed by tactile follow-ups. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final sentence crystallizes closure without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gears grew like leaves and pistons hissed like cicadas” establishes texture economically. Figurative language is coherent (mechanical biology sustained throughout), though “hum of insight” verges on label-speak. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm.

Final line (“The graceful collapse had begun”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “corals bleeding white, their skeletons exposed like bones in a graveyard” merges image, emotion, and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. Minor overwriting in “mosaic of grief” and “periodically eternal” risks abstraction, but payoff justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “silence clung like cobwebs” advances atmosphere and character. Figurative language is pattern-taught (liquid gold light, thunderous serenity) and pays off in the climax. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“calloused from years of wandering concrete and soil alike”) slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops or artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sulfurous mist clinging,” “melody of roots and chlorophyll,” “sky in hues of fire and ash.” Figurative language is consistent (botanical-mechanical blend) and never muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fragments → mirrors → threads → web) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in the tarot description (“shattered mirrors”) slightly dilutes momentum, but the final paragraph’s cadence (“threads pulsed, the portrait breathed”) achieves near-perfect propulsion. No loops, no scaffold—only one slight redundancy in “fading into the grain” / “fractured symbols.”

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, varied sentence rhythms, and vivid, purposeful imagery (“skin glowing like bleached bone,” “ink swirling like liquid night”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight overuse of figurative language in the opening paragraph (three metaphors in quick succession), but none obscure causality or dull the closure. Final line lands with quiet propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is vivid but over-ornamented in high-pressure beats: “ice crystals bloomed beneath her touch, cracking like a whispered secret” mixes bloom/crack metaphors. Repetition of “dizzying quiet” and “bravely conflicted” creates scaffold loops. Final paragraph’s “revolution began” lands cleanly, but mid-story suffers from stacked modifiers (“dangerous liaison letter, its edges sharp with urgency”) that blur propulsion. Density is high, but figurative muddle slightly dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “grains glittered like fractured starlight,” “tranquil blaze that warmed her skin.” Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Figurative language is coherent—sand as secret, silence as seed—and never muddles causality. One minor redundancy: “fragments into something whole” slightly echoes “mosaic of shattered rhythms,” but it’s thematic reinforcement, not loop. Final paragraph’s cadence (“The roses nodded… The glass dome hummed…”) creates resonant rhythm without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “zigzag of crimson light,” “lullaby sung by wolves” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphor in causal action. Sentence variety supports rhythm—short staccato beats during strikes, longer flows in reflection.

Final line (“this time, he’d listened”) perfectly recharges the opening’s focus on auditory attention without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: most lines multitask (e.g., “gears grinding like a celestial heartbeat” establishes sound, motion, and metaphor). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One slight overwriting moment: “dossier thick enough to choke a lie” risks mixed metaphor but lands due to prior textual buildup. No loops or scaffold; closure image (“nib cold against her fingertips”) is clear and resonant. High information density without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “needle a silver quill against the canvas of flesh” does triple duty (character, setting, motif). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One paraphrase loop: “dissonance will consume us all” / “dissonance gone” risks redundancy, but closure payoff justifies echo. Figurative coherence holds (amber’s “honeyed glow,” “fractal patterns”), though “haunted firmware” leans abstract. No scaffold or momentum drag; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sentence variety and purposeful figurative language (“mist clung… like a second skin”). Information density is high—each image serves atmosphere, character, and plot. One overwriting slip: “ephemeral galaxies” and “lilac-hued glow” lean decorative without advancing pressure. No loops or scaffold, but “whispers grew louder, not in volume but in clarity” slightly paraphrases the prior whisper-coiling line.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“stars burned like fractured glass,” “warm coldness”) borders on mixed metaphor but remains legible. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final third avoids artifacts; closure image is clear. One slight redundancy: “chipped” used thrice near climax, but not enough to dull impact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “shadows pooled where they shouldn’t” conveys dissonance economically; “fruit blushed riper” merges action and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (melody “spiraling outward like smoke”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “watercolors” simile slightly dilutes peak-beat clarity, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“waiting for the next encore”) resonates without redundancy, repaying the opening’s “hushed expectation.”

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fractally precise facets catching the studio’s neon-blue light” establishes tone and texture in one stroke.

No loops or scaffold—each line does multiple jobs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “wooden beams groaning like ancient bones,” “silence deepening until it felt like a living thing.” Figurative language is coherent—amber, sand, echoes recur with evolving weight.

Final line lands with rhythmic precision, echoing the opening’s amber motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely masterful, with high information density and rhythmic control (“mist clinging to the cliff’s edge like a second skin”). However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “burned spy who’d learned to read the silence between heartbeats” edges toward purple, and “truth revealed itself in layers, like ice thawing” risks mixed metaphor. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the dream sequence slightly restate realization without added pressure. These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fog rolled in like a second skin” establishes atmosphere, metaphor, and boundary-blurring in one phrase). Minor overwriting in “palimpsest promise” repetition risks abstraction, but the needle’s tactile returns ground it. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the ferry’s rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “distill complexity into essence” appears verbatim twice—docking 0.3 from a potential 9.2.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “horizon bled orange,” “air tasted of ash,” “thrums resonated in her bones.” Figurative language is patterned (phototropism, light/shadow) without muddle.

Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors wheel-spinning—steady, circular, forward-moving—charging closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “calloused hands brushing leaves,” “notches like tiny stars,” “protected vulnerability hanging in the air like mist” do triple duty—character, atmosphere, theme. Sentence variety supports rhythm: short taps mimic gauge beats; longer flows mirror harbor whispers. One minor flaw: “wistfully pragmatic understanding” edges toward label-speak, though immediately grounded in action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image (“rosebush waited for spring”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph lengths mirroring tidal shifts. Figurative language is rich but coherent—no mixed metaphors or purple prose. One minor loop: “coexist with this energy… coexist with her own future” borders on paraphrase, but the repetition serves thematic reinforcement rather than redundancy. Final line (“she began to write again”) echoes opening action without scaffold, creating resonant closure. No filter-verb stacks or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“petal-strewn crown,” “liquid light”) and varied syntax that avoids monotony. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot—no scaffolding or redundancy. Minor overwriting appears in “prismatic quiet” (used twice), and “helix”/“spiral” verge on repetitive, but these serve motif coherence. Final paragraph’s rhythm beautifully echoes opening, creating closure through cadence without looped phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“converged,” “knelt,” “crackled”) and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple layers—character, plot, atmosphere—without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, with strong verbs (“thrummed,” “shimmered,” “hissed”) and selective sensory detail. Figurative language is purposeful—“shadowed nexus swallowing him whole” sets tone without overwriting. Minor redundancy in describing claustrophobia twice, but no loops or scaffold. Closure beat (“walked through it, wistful rebellion in his heart”) lands cleanly, though “wistful rebellion” slightly edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (“mist clung… like a second skin” establishes mood, setting, and metaphor). Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm varies purposefully. Minor scaffold in “opposites unified” phrasing risks abstraction but is grounded by immediate visual payoff (ribbon “glowing like a vein of blood”). Final paragraph avoids summary, closing on resonant image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “sky hung low, a spongey gray that seemed to absorb sound” does triple duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“instruments hummed like anxious sentinels”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor deduction: “nervously confident smile faltered” leans slightly cliché, and “water-stained”/“waterlogged” near-repetition in adjacent beats.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly disciplined: “scent that clung to the air like a memory” and “notes weaving through the air like threads of light” serve atmosphere without muddling causality. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“kaleidoscope of colors,” “luminous moment”), slightly blurring focus. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts are purposeful. However, “pixelated pattern pulsed, almost alive, like a heartbeat trapped in glass” mixes biological and digital metaphors, creating slight coherence drag at a crucial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“half-swallowed by ivy,” “crumbling poster”) and varied syntax. Information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in the climax (“dusky harmony deepening into night”), and the phrase “polished calm, a perceptively calm demeanor” risks synonym churn. No fatal loops or artifacts, but slight redundancy in describing Elias’s calmness reduces propulsion in mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“silver moth trapped in amber,” “stars pooling like melted silver”) but avoids overwriting—each metaphor advances atmosphere or character. Sentence variety supports momentum: opening complex sentence establishes setting, short staccato phrases heighten climax. One minor loop: “burden” appears three times in two paragraphs (telegram → Veyra’s warning → Lirael’s realization), slightly reducing freshness. Final line (“daylily-pressed telegram crumpled in her pocket”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“time pooled like spilled ink” establishes setting, tone, and theme), and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Minor overwriting in the labyrinth’s whisper sequence (“child’s laughter… world ending in fire”) borders on stacked modifiers, slightly blurring sense. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near “anxious elation curdled into dread” could tighten. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with “steps light” cliché, though “cobalt glade… never felt so alive” recovers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “torchlight flickered like souls trapped between worlds” establishes tone while anchoring setting; “stitches small and precise, each one a whisper of regret turned into resolve” fuses action and theme.

No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences restate the cipher’s nature with slight redundancy. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and revelation. Final lines land cleanly, though “cautious exuberance” slightly labels emotion instead of embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Figurative language is controlled (“dark liquid swirling like a tiny galaxy”) and coheres with established logic. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“a Rorschach test of possibility”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure lines (“mulberry stain on the fabric of the world”) are razor-sharp and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but generally precise, with strong verbs (“pierced,” “dissolved,” “shimmered”) and varied sentence structure. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “swirling vapor that engulfed him” followed immediately by “vapor coiled around his legs” risks paraphrase-loop. The phrase “brilliant dimness” is evocative but conceptually contradictory, creating slight metaphorical friction. Closure image remains clear despite these hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)

Figurative coherence holds—coins as data, static as test, wavelength as heartbeat—and the final line (“greet it”) resolves with understated power. Information density is high; every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “amber light of dusk” conveys time, mood, and visual texture in four words. Figurative language is purposeful (“monsters etched as if carved by fear itself”) and avoids muddle. Minor redundancy in “faint and fragmented, like wind through a keyhole” slightly dulls propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic closure—cadence slows as stars “wink,” echoing Elias’s earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose avoids loops: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (e.g., “copper had oxidized to a sickly green” implies time and neglect). Figurative language is purposeful (“bridge of frozen light” echoes the bell’s function) without muddle. Sentence variety propels momentum—long descriptive strands early, staccato beats during climax. Minor overwriting in “cosmic imbalance—a rift in the weave of reality” slightly dilutes immediacy, but clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “foundations like broken teeth,” “mirrored hush” avoid cliché through specificity.

Closure image (“a starling sang, and she listened, her heart full”) earns its simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bioluminescent veins,” “soundless echo,” “liquid silver” clouds—all serve atmosphere without overwriting. Sentence variety avoids monotony; paragraph cuts align with beat shifts (node success → next disruption). Minor scaffold in “muscle memory” repetition (twice in three paragraphs) slightly dulls immediacy. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure image (“buckle warm in his palm”) recharges earlier motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “cracks spiderwebbing,” “neural filaments pulsed faintly.” Figurative language is purposeful, not decorative—opposites (fire/ice) mirror thematic tension.

Figurative language is coherent: water/secrets, seed/puzzle, brook/door metaphors interlock. Minor overwriting in “storm-born silence” (repeated twice) slightly dulls uniqueness. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters with abstract phrasing (“crucible where possibility took root”), though closure image remains potent.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: sentences advance atmosphere, character, and action (“gloved hands trembling,” “cord frayed, handle cracked”). Varied syntax supports momentum. Overwriting in peak beats: “shimmered with a thousand tiny voices” leans purple; “macerated the air” repeats with diminishing precision. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“echoes grew stronger, bolder” after “pulse with life”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “statues coated in rime like ancient ghosts,” “lantern… revealing hidden things.” Figurative language is purposeful, not excessive—metaphors align (mist as thought, boundaries as doors).

Final paragraph’s “frozen in twilight’s embrace” crystallizes tone without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density (“rusted girders humming with the serenely electric static”). Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “skeletal hand” → “spectral fingers” → “glowing veins” risks slight metaphor sprawl. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“serenely electric tension,” “liquid light winding through the rocks”) borders on ornamental but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s “river of light sang” lands cleanly, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hull shuddered, its usual hum replaced by a hollow echo” compresses sensory and emotional data.

Final lines earn their lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (cracks as maps, echoes as voices) and pays off in the diamond’s fracturing. Minor overwriting in the climax (“tidal wave of sound,” “maelstrom”) slightly blurs causality but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully, and the final line (“a reminder that some languages are meant to be felt, not spoken”) perfectly recharges the opening premise.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “petrichor, maybe, or the metallic tang of secrets” merges setting, mood, and theme in one phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “twilight’s bruise” conveys time, mood, and political decay in three words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as wound/stitch/storm) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “thunderstorm in a bottle rattled against his hip, its cork sealed with wax”—redundant specificity slightly dulls propulsion. No loops or scaffold; prose artifacts absent from closure beat, preserving impact.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: sentences advance multiple aims (“rusted and sagging” conveys setting + mood + history). Figurative language is coherent (moonlit metal → crescent shard → glowing edges). Minor overwriting in “misting hush” repetition slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Closure beat (“silence wasn’t an end. It was a beginning”) avoids summary by echoing earlier motifs with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft shows high information density (“analog memories… fragile, tangible echoes”) and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“corridor of mirrors, each reflecting a different version of the library”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language remains coherent (scarf as memory-object, geometry as key). Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“energy she’d unleashed”), but closure image (“whisper, *Continue*”) redeems momentum. Minor register drift in “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing costs 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “watercolor palette on the sill” establishes object, setting, and ritual in one stroke. Figurative language is purposeful (“horizon bled gold,” “time folded like origami”) without muddle.

No loops or scaffold—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “blinding glow” beat, but closure remains sharp. Rhythm varies purposefully: long sentences for contemplation, staccato for unraveling climax.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the parchment creaking under his touch” conveys sound, texture, fragility). Rhythm accelerates toward climax: projector threading’s steady pace gives way to trembling needles and grinding stones. One minor artifact: “methodically curious” slightly drifts toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in action (scouring archives). No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels.

Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm mirrors emotional arc. However, two adjacent lines (“The ice cavern’s walls began to shift… Stalactites dripped like wax”) border on paraphrase-loop. No scaffold or register drift, but figurative density in peak beats slightly obscures physical causality—minor artifact near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “avalanchingly quiet,” “stone spires clawed at the bruised sky” do atmospheric, character, and thematic work.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “amber through the cracks,” “maws snapping at her heels,” “mist swirled, formless.” Figurative language is purposeful—quill wilting as lie-detector never overextends. Minor scaffold in “She packed her tools…” list, but quickly offset by active verbs. No loops or register drift; final paragraph’s cadence (“Truth… was nourishment”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity. One near-paraphrase (“repurposed… echoes”) slightly dulls peak revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful, with high information density: “pendulums from copper and quartz, their arcs timed to catch the light and cast prismatic shadows” advances setting, character, and theme. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“melody so pure it made the clouds part”), bordering on purple prose, but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final line masterfully recharges opening motifs. One paraphrase loop (“silence was the canvas, and her bells painted symphonies”) slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “petal-shaped solar panels,” “fears inside were restless, their energy leaking like a virus.” Figurative language is purposeful—no purple excess—and metaphors cohere (fire purifies, static sings). Minor deduction for slight overuse of “static” as motif near climax, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“now it felt like a song”) crystallizes tone without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “cobblestones gleamed,” “faces blurred by time.” Sentences vary in length and structure, supporting rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density is high (e.g., locket description conveys age, condition, and clue). One minor overwriting moment: “vibrant mosaic of green and gold” leans decorative but doesn’t obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“She’d solved the mystery...”) versus dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but occasional overwriting dilutes peak beats: “shimmered like liquid” borders on vague, and “ghostly images of the scientist dancing—a waltz, slow and deliberate” slightly redundantly modifies. Still, high information density prevails—most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm modulates effectively; final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes theme without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “boots crunching over brittle white fragments,” “silence so complete it hummed.” Sentences vary rhythmically, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. Minor flaw: slight overuse of “pockets of gravity” as a phrase (three times in close proximity) risks scaffold repetition, though meaning evolves each time. No mixed metaphors or purple prose; every image serves the accumulative drive. Final line’s “gleaming silence” perfectly echoes the opening’s tactile stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“fireflies drifted like embers, their glow reflecting off the origami crane’s delicate folds” advances atmosphere, object, and motif). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “terrestrially cosmic gaze turning inward” edges toward abstraction, though quickly grounded. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—cadence slows, then walks away with assurance.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (“wisteria vines curled around wrought-iron benches,” “engravings shifting like liquid”). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating at the climax. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is precise and earned. Final line (“a voice answered”) delivers propulsion and closure without overwriting. Minor deduction for slight lyric excess in meteor description, but no artifacts impair clarity or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “thorns sharp enough to draw blood” conveys danger, beauty, and pain in one phrase. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“dissonant chorus,” “constellations of light”) slightly muddles causality, but rhythm varies effectively. One paraphrase loop: “archived every failure... storing it in jars” could tighten. Closure beat (“lighter... shed a skin”) avoids artifact, though “ghostly resolve” repeats without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere (“stalactites dripping like liquid time” does triple duty). No loops, scaffolds, or synonym churn; figurative language is coherent (time as liquid, treason as calibration). Final paragraph avoids summary—“vanished, leaving only the echo of her purpose” crystallizes closure without explanation. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “mosaic of broken promises” (metaphor slightly strained), but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“stone coils like a sleeping serpent,” “webs of intrigue”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match ascent momentum. One paraphrase loop weakens impact: “truth would rise… slow unraveling” and later “ensure the truth is heard” slightly redundantly frame the same intent. Figurative coherence holds—no mixed metaphors—but “progressive disclosure” stands out as abstract amid concrete textures. Closure line (“pressed to his heart”) resonates without artifact, though earlier “richly perceptive” borders on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“candles burned lower, their light borrowed starlight”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional beats, and metaphors cohere (ghosts as dancing shadows, voice as wind through reeds). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful, not decorative. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “fragile” motifs, but no artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“harbor lights flickered like drowsy fireflies” establishes setting, mood, and metaphor). Sentence variety supports rhythm: short clauses for action (“He smiled”), flowing phrases for reflection. Minor overwriting in “bioluminescent trails weaving through the reeds like liquid silver”—mixed vehicle (weaving + liquid)—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding; every image serves theme or character. Final paragraph’s simplicity (“watched the fireflies until dawn”) earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “dust froze mid-fall; the trees ceased their rustling” uses semicolon for simultaneity without error. Figurative language is selective (“apples glowed like miniature suns”) and never muddled. Minor scaffold appears in “her intuition prickled... practiced precision”—slightly generic—but quickly redeemed by concrete action. No loops, synonym churn, or register drift; closure beat (“boots crunching on grit”) lands with clean, resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language (“storm clawed,” “drowned skies”) that avoids purple excess by anchoring metaphors in action (palm on vibrating glass). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching storm intensity. Minor flaw: “lyrically prophetic” appears twice as a near-label, slightly flattening subtext. Otherwise, high information density with zero scaffold or loops—every line advances atmosphere, character, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “crunching sand that had drifted through cracks” advances setting, character, and mood. Occasional overwriting (“positively wistful gold”) slightly clashes with vagrant POV but serves tone. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“He carried…”, “Elias had been…”, “He’d spent…”). Minor scaffold in verse revisions—three attempts feel slightly staged—but each deepens thematic precision without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “horizon bled tangerine and lavender” establishes tone while anchoring time; “sonic waves rippling through the ice” merges action and setting. Sentence rhythm varies skillfully—staccato during conflict, flowing in resolution. Minor overwriting in one beat (“logically emotional, a paradox that made his chest tighten”) edges toward label-speak, but is redeemed by immediate physicality. No loops or scaffold; every line advances pressure, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frost etched the basalt sanctuary in silver” establishes tone and texture in one stroke. Sentences vary rhythmically—long coils for observation, staccato for action (“He knelt again”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (filings “dance,” hum “sharpens” in cold). Minor deduction: “softly purposeful” slightly risks label-speak, though immediately grounded in resetting filings.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong verbs (“groaned,” “slammed,” “writhe”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: “flickering flame that seemed to pulse in time with her heartbeat” edges toward purple, and “watchfully calm” repeats as a near-tautology. No paraphrase loops, but “entangled memories” appears twice without deepening. Closure line (“done being controlled”) lands cleanly, though slightly on-the-nose compared to earlier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line yield (“vibrant hush,” “metallic tang of clockwork gears”). Minor overwriting in the storm metaphor (“patient and ominous”) slightly strains coherence, but not enough to obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors resolve—steady, insistent—matching rain and ticking heart. A single mixed register (“deliberate, meaningful steps”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “air tasted of rust and possibility” fuses setting and theme in one phrase. Sentences vary rhythmically—staccato for tension (“No. That’s not it.”), flowing for flight (“The *Skein* surged, its gears screaming”). One minor slip: “transliterate wildly” slightly abstracts peak action, but immediately grounded in sail-tweaks. Zero loops or scaffolding; every line propels.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs (“danced across the interface,” “gnawed at her”) and varied syntax. Information density is high: the patch introduces symbol, backstory, and tactile anchor in one beat. Minor flaw: “brightly attentive” appears twice verbatim—a small loop. Figurative language is controlled (“footprints in snow” for deleted files), though “glowing labyrinth” leans slightly generic. Final paragraph propels momentum without overwriting; closure image (“mind racing toward the edge”) avoids purple prose. No scaffold or redundancy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “silence felt like a language,” “ice floes shifting, their edges cracking like glass.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (aurora as moral compass) and pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “the world seemed to grip reality loosely” avoids cliché through tactile specificity. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Minor artifact: “fold in patience” appears twice with near-identical phrasing, risking paraphrase-loop, but payoff justifies recurrence. No filter-verb stacks or purple prose; every line advances atmosphere, character, or pressure. Final image (“scent of salt and frost”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density (“lacquered wood glowing like trapped sunlight,” “sky hung low, bruised with the promise of rain”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in one beat (“dance creates the world”) edges toward abstraction, but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is consistent (smoke-coiling voices, wind-chime laughter) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “conjuring clearings through peripheral awareness” risks abstraction, but it’s grounded by immediate action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors “whisperfield calm.”

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“vines climbed like green fingers”) and consistent. Minor overwriting in one beat (“transmute rust into art, abandonment into possibility”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“began to shoot”) resolves with quiet propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: most lines advance character, theme, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph lengths shaping visual cadence. Minor overwriting appears in the phrase “mosaic of color and shadow that seemed to pulse with a rhythm he almost recognized”—slightly redundant with later “fractured sequences.” No loops or scaffold, though one adjacent paraphrase (“fractured, a series of jumps and pauses” / “jumps and pauses, like the crystal’s facets”) nudges density downward.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“fog clung like a second skin,” “visions dissolve like sugar in tea”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every line advances atmosphere or character.

    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled—“domes piercing the clouds,” “cracks spiderwebbed”—without purple excess. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the climax (“deafening roar,” “sustained note”) and one paraphrase loop (“spinning anew, faster… accelerated to a blur”). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes then accelerates appropriately. Final line (“Then, he leaped.”) is perfect—concrete, decisive, echoing earlier verbs (“lunged,” “ran”). No scaffold or AI artifacts mar clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—sentences vary rhythmically, paragraphs breathe with emotional beats. Figurative language is purposeful (“pulsing stillness,” “scent of hope”) without muddle. One paraphrase loop: “fractured goodbyes into something bearable” slightly echoes earlier “bridge the chasm.” No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Closure image hums with earned resonance.

    High information density: “ivy and honeysuckle, hummed with the whispers of forgotten seasons” establishes atmosphere, sound, and temporal depth in one phrase. Varied syntax avoids drumbeat rhythms; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., post-revelation silence). Minor overwriting in “tapestry of memories, both joyful and painful”—slightly abstract for peak beat—but quickly grounded by Elias’s dialogue. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, conflict, or setting.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist curled like smoke,” “zephyr bloom—a fragrance like jasmine and ozone” do double duty establishing atmosphere and advancing mood. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Her fingers traced…”, “Using a tool…”, “Hours passed…”). One minor overwriting risk (“reflectively vibrant glow”) slightly muddles causality, but clarity at closure remains intact. Paragraph cuts serve emotional beats—no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “honeyed hush thick as syrup” merges taste and sound; “rusted server racks cradled terrariums” juxtaposes decay and nurture. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One minor slip: “proactive about grief” edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in Elias’s orchid gesture. No loops, scaffolding, or purple excess—every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language (“time and truth tangled like kelp,” “shadows that moved like liquid”), but avoids purple overload by anchoring metaphors in physical sensation. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional rhythm. Minor flaw: slight synonym churn in “whispering secrets she could almost understand” / “pages… whispering back” / “whisper of closing pages”—a faint loop that dulls the final image’s uniqueness. Otherwise, high information density and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled: “wind-up birds that chirped in forgotten tongues” establishes voice economically.

Minor overwriting in “luminous orb” moon description, but rhythm varies purposefully—short sentences (“It worked.”) punctuate lyrical flows. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances theme or atmosphere. Closure beat (“world felt whole again”) avoids abstraction by grounding in dappled shadows and humming sapling.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied syntax, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence propels. Minor overwriting in “flash-paper alchemist knelt in the snow. His breath hung…” (two consecutive atmospheric descriptions) slightly dulls momentum, but not enough to obscure causality. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters just slightly with “The world would have to wait”—a rare abstract note—but closure image remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“gears scattered like dead leaves”) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “wounded season” repetition, but no loops or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with abstract phrasing (“reverse-engineered a miracle”), costing 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“air tasted of wet metal and old prayers”) and varied sentence architecture. Figurative language is coherent—flame “licked like a tongue,” hush “curling into smoke”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “boundary-lessly trapped limbo” slightly jars, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “clinking fractals” and “fragmented but familiar” melody deliver closure with rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“steam curl toward the ceiling while the world outside blurred into abstraction”) and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “silver threads that blurred the city’s skyline into a watercolor haze” risks purple prose, though pattern-taught. One paraphrase loop: “hollowed her, leaving a space” / “carve something new from the void.” Otherwise, high information density, zero scaffold, and strong propulsion through concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language (“bruised violet,” “stuck coin sun”) is coherent and purposeful.

Information density remains high without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely polished with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high: “moonlight pooled on the floor, illuminating a jagged metal fragment” advances setting, plot, and mood. But minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “functional resurrection, a rebirth of purpose through redirected flows” stacks near-synonyms. The phrase “stoic wonder filling her chest” uses label-speak instead of embodiment. These don’t obscure closure but prevent 8.5+ line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “petrichor… seeping through cracks” conveys weather, setting, and emotional intrusion in seven words. Sentence openings vary (“In the hush…”, “Lira, an introverted…”, “The crystal whispering…”) avoiding template cadence. One minor overwriting lapse: “glacial hush deepened” slightly muddles thermal/tactile registers, but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“shimmered,” “lapped,” “creaked”) and purposeful figurative language. Minor overwriting in “serene upheaval” and “slow fuse” leans slightly purple, but pattern is controlled. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“he’d found something far more valuable”), reducing immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “planks bleached by decades of salt and sun,” “spirals that pulsed faintly, as if remembering.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (lightning → memory → promise) and pays off. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in one paragraph, but rhythm remains varied and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly disciplined—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“low, resonant vibration,” “lonesome splendor”), slightly diluting propulsion.

Final lines avoid artifact, landing with rhythmic clarity and motif reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frozen tear,” “liquid light,” “spiderwebbing cracks” do triple duty. Minor overwriting in the opening (“bedraggled form—a tattered velvet doublet…”) risks purple prose but pays off in thematic texture. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final lines (“flawed… alive… bitterly sweet struggle”) crystallize theme without redundancy. One mixed metaphor (“world breathe” after mechanical sterility) slightly blurs physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“kelp-drift peace” evokes setting, tone, and decay in three words). Figurative language is controlled—no purple excess—and metaphors cohere (mirror, song, roots). Minor scaffold in “smothering guilt” leans diagnostic, but it’s isolated and quickly grounded in action. Final paragraph’s rhythm—short, declarative, then expansive—perfectly modulates closure without artifact or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “cobblestones streaked with the ashen residue of a thousand unremembered dreams” advances atmosphere, character, and theme in one stroke. Figurative language is consistent (light/shadow, sound/silence motifs) but borders on overuse in early paragraphs—“bruised sky,” “fractured starlight,” “sidereal patience” cluster without breath. No loops or scaffolds; every sentence propels. Final lines earn their lyricism without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “teeth approximating infinity in their spiral design” conveys object, theme, and limitation simultaneously. Minor overwriting in the opening (“shimmered like mother-of-pearl” followed by “sentient flora”) slightly dilutes momentum, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Sentence openings vary (“Lumin stood…”, “Across the quiet sigh…”, “You sense it too…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line’s “gentler flame” resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies effectively, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “shadows that danced like restless spirits” and “living embers” edges toward mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences summarize ancestral losses rather than dramatize them (“his great-grandfather… his aunt…”), slightly dulling momentum. Closure image remains sharp despite this.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “glassy slopes,” “jagged teeth,” “air thickening like syrup” advance atmosphere, character, and tension simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs (staccato during crisis, flowing in resolution). One minor redundancy: “steady as she wound the gears that kept the village’s heartbeat alive” slightly overlaps with later “rhythm steady.” No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle—peak beats remain clear despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “cobalt paint that shimmered under the moon” does atmospheric, symbolic, and spatial work. Sentence openings vary (“After the chess clock...”, “She spread...”, “The final thread...”). One minor overwriting lapse: “labyrinth of frayed threads that seemed to whisper of uncharted echoes” edges toward abstraction, but is redeemed by immediate tactile grounding (“run her fingers along the frayed edges”). No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “obsidian spire clawed at the horizon” merges setting and theme; “ink mingling with crisp air” ties sensory detail to action.

No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Closure image is sharpened, not dulled, by lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in “soft, expectant hush that lingers like the final note of a violin”—slightly ornamental—but quickly redeemed by concrete action. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s “ash on her hands glittering like stardust” risks cliché but earns it through contextual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: metaphors (“gravel in a tin can”) are precise and unmixed, syntax varies purposefully, and every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Minor redundancy in “sedimentary layers”/“sediment” (lines 12/20) slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors Elias’s resolve—short clauses building to earned stillness. Closure image (“heartbeat”) lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“shelves sagging under centuries of leather-bound secrets”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (music as language, noise as hatred) and pays off in closure without muddle. Minor overwriting in “braid diverse voices into harmony” risks abstraction but is grounded immediately by concrete action. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Final line recharges the rosette motif with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “a tangled mess of vines, its leaves yellowed and curled”). Minor overwriting in the climax (“sculpture of light and life”) slightly muddles the closure image. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“rewiring of its very essence” after botanical pruning) creates slight coherence drag.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Her job was simple… recite logs in her sleep” establishes routine and expertise). Figurative language is pattern-taught: “nectar dusk” echoes honey imagery, charging closure. Minor artifact: “pollinating doubt” slightly strains metaphor logic (doubt vs. curiosity), but coherence holds. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates during drone discovery, breathes in final booth scene. Deduction: “cryptic riddle” phrasing verges on label-speak, but immediate dramatization mitigates.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “streetlights daydreamed in their amber haze” does triple duty (setting, tone, POV). Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose—though “inadvertently profound” slightly risks abstraction (saved by contextual grounding). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One minor loop: “displaced objects” repeated without added pressure in mid-ritual, but closure beat remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bioluminescent algae painted the walls in shifting hues of teal and violet” establishes tone economically. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Figurative language is purposeful (“silver strands trailing behind her like a lifeline”) and consistent with underwater logic. Minor overwriting in “cascade of images—her grandmother’s face, the garden whole, the ocean healed” slightly softens immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mar key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “steps carved from stone that shimmered like aged parchment” establishes tone and texture economically. Figurative language is consistent (staircase as breathing entity, loss as infinite silence) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “calculated the odds... derived through mathematical proofs scrawled...” slightly redundantly links calculation and proof, but no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks.

    Prose is dense with purpose: “orchids bloomed like defiant lips” merges image and theme without purple excess. Sentence variety supports momentum—fragments for urgency, flowing syntax for reverie. One minor artifact: “methodically hopeful” borders on label-speak but is redeemed by fossil/cataloging metaphor. Closure beat (“brush lay empty… fanned like a starfish”) avoids overwriting while crystallizing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “bread shaped like initials… a vow to remember”). Figurative language is purposeful (“grief filtered, leaving only beauty”) and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy in “thaw had begun” appearing twice slightly dulls momentum, but rhythm varies effectively—short punches amid lyrical flow. Final paragraph’s cadence (“a loaf, a song, a story”) resonates without overstatement. No scaffold loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the lighthouse’s shadow stretched over him, cold and accusatory” does setting, mood, and character in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (“beam slicing through fog like a blade”). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Only minor density excess in “reverse-engineered its mechanics for years”—slightly tell-y, but swiftly redeemed by action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is precise, with high information density (“bruise-colored sky,” “diseased star” for the shadow). Figurative language is potent but occasionally dense in peak beats (“jagged shadows that clawed at the walls” borders on mixed metaphor). Minor scaffold in backstory block (“photographically cursed since childhood…”) could be tighter. No loops or register drift; diction stays character-bound. Final paragraph’s cadence sharpens closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “cumulus scrolls, their edges frayed like sheet music” does triple duty (image, metaphor, foreshadowing). Rhythm varies—staccato strikes vs. blooming resonance. One minor flaw: “fractal generating—a method she’d invented” slightly tells, but immediately dramatized. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Closure line (“taste of salt and victory”) recharges opening salt spray.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most lines multitask (e.g., “skeletal remains” conveys setting, stakes, and backstory). Figurative language is purposeful (“silhouettes blurred like dunes in a storm”). Minor overwriting in “rhythmic thudding that matched her pulse”—slightly redundant. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Final line’s cadence (“screaming all along”) delivers perfect closure beat without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, avoid filter verbs, and layer sensory detail with thematic weight (“ivy parted to reveal a rusted iron door”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in “greenish folds” risks abstraction but pays off in the final gardening metaphor. Closure image (“gardeners of memory”) recharges the opening ivy motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “arches cradling murky water where sunlight once danced” conveys setting, loss, and time in one image. Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose—though “hushed blaze” slightly risks abstraction (saved by immediate grounding in liquid amber). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors thematic resolution without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose shows high information density: “bloated from decades underwater” conveys time, damage, and neglect in three words. Sentence openings vary (“The blackout crept…”, “Lira froze…”, “Inside, the chamber…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “dappled resolve” (used twice) slightly dulls the final image. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“polish until the stone weeps”) and pays off in the climax. Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“luminous torment, beautiful and agonizing”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but clarity remains intact. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“laugh like shattered glass,” “grief made solid”) is precise and pattern-taught. Minor scaffold in “circuit breakers hummed and cooled belowdecks” slightly stalls momentum, but propulsion quickly resumes. No loops or mixed metaphors; final paragraph’s cadence (“Let them come”) delivers earned punch without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and high information density (“stone arches framed the dusk like a crown of shadows”). Figurative language is controlled, though slightly dense in the opening paragraph. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for one near-redundant phrase (“flicker of recognition… stars had whispered a name they both knew”) that borders on paraphrase, but momentum remains unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “watch hand trembled, as if aware of the guilt”). Figurative language is purposeful—“barnacles” concretizes guilt; “sieved hush” evokes both texture and loss. Minor overwriting in “writhing in his chest” slightly strains physical logic. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence sharpens closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “stones pitted by decades of salt and regret”). Minor overwriting in one beat: “furrowed hush before the storm” borders on mixed metaphor, though it’s redeemed by later reuse. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors steady resolve amid chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“waves slapping the hull like a metronome” conveys sound, rhythm, and Clara’s anxiety). Minor overwriting in “flickering faith of her childhood wash over her”—“flickering faith” borders on mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final third avoids artifacts, though “mosaic of blue” leans slightly generic amid otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “slick with moss that pulsed faintly blue” does setting, mood, and foreshadowing in six words. Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create rhythm. Minor redundancy in “fragments of guilt that surfaced like ink in water” followed by “labyrinth of choices”—but quickly resolved. No scaffold loops; every image serves escalation or closure. Final line’s cadence perfectly encapsulates Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“spice-paste...glowed faintly violet” shows magic’s activation). Figurative language is coherent—ashes as “dormant hearts,” scent as “second layer of flesh”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“tidal wave of cosmic intimacy”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but rhythm varies naturally and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “robes pooling like ink” conveys color, texture, and emotional weight. Figurative language is pattern-taught (cracks, hands, ink) and never muddled; metaphors cohere (time as rain in a saucer, repentance as ash and honey). Sentence variety propels momentum—fragments for tension (“The glade shuddered”), flowing clauses for reflection. One minor slip: “frayed at the edges, as if time itself had gnawed at it” slightly over-explains, but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“stitch the fraying edges of reality itself” conveys role, metaphor, and world logic). Figurative language is pattern-taught (tears → light → garden) and payoff-integrated. Minor artifact: slight overuse of “stitch” variants, but not looped or scaffolded. Final paragraph’s “ghostly resolve” echoes opening without redundancy, deepening resonance. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively; no syntactic monotony or purple prose muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “bottled lightning bug collection—stolen moments of light” does triple duty (object, metaphor, character). Sentence openings vary (“On the black sand…”, “She was…”, “Her hands…”), and rhythm breathes with the scene’s pulse. Minor overwriting in “dazzling, chaotic spiral” slightly dilutes the bugs’ earlier specificity, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“listen to every one”) echoes the opening hush, closing the cadence with earned simplicity. High information density throughout; every image pulls weight.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with strong verbs (“gnawed,” “muffled,” “ignited”) and varied syntax. Information density high: “half-painted sundial” conveys backstory and urgency in three words. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One slight overwriting: “cradle of sparks—a network of like-minded souls hidden beneath the fort’s glittering facade” borders on explanatory. Final paragraph’s rhythm effectively mirrors thematic closure without drumbeat cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “aurora painted the sky in liquid green and violet” conveys color, motion, texture, and mood in one phrase. Syntax varies rhythmically—fragments for tension, complex sentences for revelation. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence propels. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “star dust screamed”) skirts overwriting but avoids muddle by grounding in prior logic. Final line resonates without redundancy: “finally learned to listen” recharges “messengers” and “language” motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “iron ribs groaning like a beast in pain” merges setting and emotion economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (storm = truth-force) and pays off in closure (“storm kiss my wonder”). Minor overwriting in one beat (“clouds roiled like liquid mercury”) risks purple prose but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero loops or scaffolds; every sentence advances character, theme, or pressure. Final line’s rhythm (“raw and unfiltered”) echoes opening’s “storm’s breath,” creating earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density—“prismatic shadows,” “gears clicking in rhythm with his thoughts”—without purple excess. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One paraphrase loop: “not decoded… recontextualized” followed by near-redundant explanation slightly dulls momentum. Figurative coherence holds: light motifs unify setting, object, and theme without mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: “luminous fracture against the darkness” earns its lyricism through context. Minor overwriting in early description (“skeletal structure of corrugated metal”) slightly slows momentum, but rhythm accelerates during molt. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors cohere (moth wings, seeds, bricks). Final paragraph’s cadence—“It wasn’t much... but it was enough”—resolves with understated power.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glass ribs shimmering with trapped sunlight,” “strings humming with residual energy” do triple duty (image, atmosphere, character). Figurative language is coherent—light swallowed, notes hanging like questions—and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold in “she’d come here to escape…” paragraph, but no loops or register drift. Final line (“Tonight, she’d surprise it back”) crisply resolves the opening tension with rhythmic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “violets bled into golds,” “net frayed into smoke” do double duty. Figurative language is coherent (light/liquid motifs unify seed, pool, mirrors). However, slight overwriting in the opening paragraph (“time pooled like dew… forgotten hymns”) risks purple prose, and “luminous doubt” borders on label-speak. No loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “fractured visions and mend the seams” / “web… strand had snapped.”

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “damp tang of post-rain earth,” “translucent as sea foam” avoid cliché through specificity. Syntax varies purposefully—long descriptive lines yield to staccato beats during stitching. One minor overwriting slip: “bruise of cerulean” slightly strains metaphor, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot.
