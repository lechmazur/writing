  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is imagistically rich and demonstrates purposeful rhythm variation, yet suffers from pervasive overwriting that dulls momentum. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence—"charcoal smuggler's ledger strip clenched between her teeth, its edges blistering her lips," "sky became a blade of starlight," "dawn seep down the cliff faces like pale enamel"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that slows rather than propels. Several metaphors are mixed or strained: "flames licking the rafters like wolves tasting blood" conflates vehicle and action incoherently. Template cadence runs appear: "She crouched... She followed... She pressed... She knelt... She pocketed... She understood... She crushed... She turned... She emerged... She paid... She would open... She lifted." Paraphrase loops recur: the "scorched testament" is described three times in adjacent paragraphs with slight variation, and "steady adaptive" is repeated without added pressure. These artifacts cluster in the second half and touch the closure beat ("discovering purpose in the pauses, her steady adaptive heart"), triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid ("silent clouds that hung like unplayed chords"). Information density is high in the fork-striking sequence. However, multiple paraphrase loops damage momentum: paragraphs 18–19 restate the theme of silence-as-expression without added pressure, and "silently expressive" recurs as template phrase. The phrase "the conservatory glowed like a sunrise trapped under ice" is strong, but the final third accumulates poetic assertion ("counting her footsteps as measures, her heartbeat as tempo") that substitutes lyricism for narrative advancement. Template cadence in "she struck another, then another" and synonym churn around "silent" / "silence" / "hushed" trigger line-level drag.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (lens as ticket, library dome cracked like skull, fire translating grief into light). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, stakes, or character. However, several beats exhibit scaffold artifacts: "inadvertently stubborn" appears twice verbatim as a label, "occupying impossible spaces" recurs as template phrasing without evolving meaning, and "distress signals" is repeated across paragraphs in summary rather than fresh action. The final third sustains metaphor density without pattern-teaching, creating mild overwriting (−0.4 for figurative saturation in peak beats). Stock metaphors like "tugged at him like an unpaid debt" and "books breathing underwater" reduce specificity. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, but cumulative text-pattern issues and filter-verb stacks ("he saw," "he felt," "he understood") dull immediacy in key moves.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift effectively. Information density is high—most lines do double work. However, paraphrase loops appear: "gently persistent through the alleys" in paragraph three is echoed by "the residents' gently persistent way" in paragraph thirteen, and "amplified quiet" recurs without material shift. The phrase "drawn the antique silver bell" appears twice in near-identical constructions. Template cadence in several "She [verb]" openers and the repeated stem "Tonight/Then/There she" across paragraphs create mild sluggishness. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "breathing continued" is vivid, "open mouth that had forgotten speech" is strained. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.4), and one mixed metaphor (−0.3) totals −0.9, landing the score near 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout: petals as "slow fireworks," flowers as "tiny lanterns," wisteria scent "drinkable," breath tasting "purple, medicinal." In peak beats—camera projection, orchard passage—this density persists without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating a decorative haze that competes with momentum. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She unfolded… She loosened… She asked… She understood… She felt…" The final paragraph loops conceptually, restating the transformation in multiple abstract claims without a single sharp image. Clarity remains adequate, but propulsion suffers under ornamental load, and the lack of varied sentence openings flattens rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with high information density: "roots threading backward through years, branches corkscrewing into futures not yet chosen" does dual work (image + causality). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent (sap as breath, bark as photographic paper, planks curling like burning film). Two slips: "periscope" then "helical well" stacks metaphors for the same function without added pressure, and "quaking reverie that rattled her teeth with centuries" mixes tactile and temporal vehicles. No paraphrase loops detected. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm supports accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clarity is mostly maintained, but several lines exhibit figurative overload that slows comprehension: "taped beneath a piano bench by the last music-man before the regime padlocked the turnstiles; he had died singing, but not before he encoded the vault's location in the order of keys left stuck to cracked velvet, a silent chord that could open earth instead of ears" packs nested clauses without clear priority. Minor paraphrase loop: "she scattered a fistful…pressing each grain into the soil" restates the planting action. Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" across three consecutive beats. Stock metaphor: "sunlight pouring in like brass band music." These artifacts cluster near the closure sequence, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual texture. Figurative density is high throughout—"aurora bled," "cells divide in cambium layers," "hemorrhaging russet," "bruised note"—and several metaphors stack in peak beats without pattern-taught payoff, triggering overwriting penalty (−0.5). Mixed vehicle: "cello roar" conflates string and wind. Paraphrase loop: "the gap she had preserved by collecting absences" recaps "collecting absences" already stated two paragraphs prior without new pressure (−0.2). No template cadence or filter stacks, but density occasionally obscures causality (what mechanically happens when she "feeds" intangible gap to forge). Information density is high; propulsion steady but textured rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies, but several beats rely on decorative lyricism that slows momentum: "the scent of iron and marigolds," "a ribbon of pale light unfurl across her palm," "tears drying into luminous disbelief." "Illuminated moment" recurs six times, borderline loop territory. Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed metaphors ("moth wings" for realization, "destiny's door," "glass negatives," "constellation of forgotten grins") that remain legible but crowd the texture. Two paraphrase loops: the woman's grief is restated three times (widest smile/mother's gaze, husband's face, man she first loved). Sentence openings vary. Clarity is good; no causality breaks from line-level issues. The final train image ("destiny breathing back") charges the close, but the density cap for overwriting applies: −0.6 for pervasive figurative layering and −0.3 for the "illuminated moment" loop.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and auditory variety. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (sensory detail, character reveal, thematic charge). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "drip-lines racing," "mercury dreams," "emotional tectonic shift," "glass thread yet to harden." Minor deduction: a few vehicles edge toward overwriting without full pattern-teaching—"thoughtfully spirited" glass, "defeated army retreating" cornice—and the concentration of metaphor in some beats (heart loosening like ice, heart rearranging as tectonic shift, footprints lifting off ground) occasionally blurs immediacy under peak pressure without causing closure opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Opening and closing images are strong. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. However, figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "camera-smoke," "iron stacks," "stars spilled like unpaid extras," "dawn bruised the horizon," "rust into galaxies" crowd nearly every paragraph, creating minor overwriting that competes for attention. Mixed metaphor: film cans "stacked like vertebrae" then "the library's metallic creaks folded into a hush" blurs the anatomical image with acoustic softness. Template cadence appears in paired participial openers: "Kneeling, I gently rotated…" / "Hands shaking, I pried…" Signal of craft debt that does not obscure causality but reduces line-level tightness. Deduct −0.6 for density and coherence slips; no artifact touches closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and carries high information density in many lines ("The fort's stones answered, groaning as if remembering the weight of every absent banner"). However, multiple passages loop similar imagery without advancing pressure: the booklet is described shedding gold dust/flakes at least three times, the hush is repeatedly "ambered" or "marbled," and the mapping action cycles through bracket/spiral/smudge/line without escalation. The phrase "mildly obsessed" appears twice in identical form. Figurative density is near-constant (moth wings, guilty evidence, temperature of extinct suns, cooling wax) without pattern-teaching or strategic breathing room, risking overwriting in a lyric mode that doesn't fully offset the decorative load.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "In loop one hundred and ninety-three" / "Now, in loop three hundred and seventy-three"; "The frozen courtyard at twilight" opens three paragraphs; "through looped timelines" recurs four times. Stock metaphors—"cold burning sensation," "revolution occurring in its neural architecture"—dull peak beats. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate the loop premise without new pressure. Figurative language in the climax ("moment before creation, mundane and mystical simultaneously") borders on mixed metaphor but remains legible. The final third carries multiple template stems and synonym churn, disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many lines doing double work (e.g., "dust floated like plankton in the beam of her pocket torch, settling on the obsolete projector whose lens was missing" anchors object, POV tool, and prior loss report). Several patterned artifacts accumulate: "ambiguously clear" and "resonant hush" recur as labels without fresh sensory grounding; "the timeframe after words become unnecessary had begun" and similar abstract constructions elevate register beyond a night registrar's likely interior voice under pressure; paraphrase loops appear ("heart drumming a funeral march," "pulse stumbled"). Template cadence in some beats ("She knelt… Then came voices… She almost stepped out… She withdrew…") and stock metaphor ("like a wound," "grew teeth") further dull momentum. These artifacts touch the middle beats but not the closure image directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −1.2 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Paraphrase loops and scaffold phrases recur: "She understood" appears five times, often opening consecutive beats with similar syntax. Template cadence runs through the middle section with parallel "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. "Commemorating small victories elaborately" repeats verbatim across three paragraphs without variation. Mixed metaphor in "blooming withering cycle of giving and taking" blurs the vehicle. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the mutual-service theme without advancing situation. Figurative language ("forgotten promises," "constellation of broken memories") appears in most sentences of key beats without clear payoff, approaching overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the aviary module where the native moth-bats folded their glassy pinions and pretended to sleep" anchors setting, creature, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "patient spider," "prism," "paper fan," "lattice of light." Deduction for mild overwriting in the midpoint descriptive run ("subsonic hum that vibrated the titanium ribs" followed by "interference patterns" and "signature of subdued awakenings") where metaphoric density briefly slows momentum without pattern-teaching payoff. The final paragraph's repetition of "mechanically warm" and "obliging" reads as intentional echo rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately and clarity is maintained across most beats, but several patterns dull momentum: paraphrase loops appear ("trapped between spaces—between the pit and the stage, between rehearsals and performances, between being heard and being invisible"; "the spaces between, the disruptions, the water-damaged pages"), template cadence runs stack similar structures without variation, and the final paragraph summarizes the arc rather than propelling through image. Information density is uneven—early beats advance efficiently, but middle paragraphs recycle "between-spaces" and "wordless conversation" as thematic labels without adding pressure. No major grammatical errors, but "flip-book" and other contemporary references jar slightly against the Victorian-ghost register. Filter-verb clusters ("understood," "realized," "knew") in the climactic beats reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or pressure. Figurative language is controlled and specific ("green pigment smudged beneath her thumb, releasing a ghost of chlorophyll sorrow") with vehicles that cohere. Minor overwriting in the aurora description ("green ropes dragging violet scars") and one paraphrase loop (paragraph 7 restates the stranger's arrival without adding pressure). Template cadence appears briefly in mid-section ("She touched... She moved... She wrapped") but breaks before becoming pervasive. The final logbook entry provides efficient closure without summarizing emotion. No clarity-breaking artifacts touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language ("damp wool," "mercury or guilt," "beaded gyroscope") earns its keep by charging objects with thematic weight. Two line-level issues: paraphrase loops in adjacent beats—"pressed her palm…steadying herself" then "braced the wheel upright and pressed her ear"; "swallowed truth" recurs five times without evolving pressure. Template cadence in mid-section: "She + verb" stems stack across four sentences. Subtract −0.6 for loops and stems, but closure beats remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    Rhythm is controlled and purposeful, with varied sentence lengths creating a meditative cadence suited to the Accumulative lens. However, line-level clarity suffers from dense figurative layering without clear payoff: "walls warping into shelves of moss-laced parchment," "shelves folding into wings of paper cranes that dissolved into ash" mixes metaphor and literal action, obscuring whether these are perceptual images or physical events. Paraphrase loops appear: "the library itself was the obsidian refuge" restates the opening image without added pressure; "cryptic folds in a well-worn origami swan" recurs four times across the piece with minimal variation, functioning as scaffold rather than charged motif. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the regenerative silence pool," "felt her own edges soften," "felt her memories flatten") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Stock metaphors ("thick as dust motes," "cool as the obsidian refuge") and elevated diction ("regenerative," "transcription," "stalactite") create a uniform, distancing texture that does not modulate with emotional intensity. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job (description or state assertion) rather than advancing multiple story dimensions simultaneously. The final third does not sharpen propulsion or clarity; instead it layers more figurative language ("scales knitting into wings of black paper," "parchment leaves budding, flowering, falling") that aestheticizes the transformation without making the cost viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is generally high and the opening/closing anchors are strong. However, several prose artifacts weaken momentum: paraphrase loops ("the ordinary magic she guarded was fading" / "eyes had begun to glaze over screens, wonder traded for certainty" restates the same diagnostic), stock metaphors ("door had cracked open inside their ribs," "silk scarves in wind"), and filter-verb stacks in the eclipse beat ("felt the ridge inhale," "felt their gazes climb"). Template cadence in the children's beat ("a girl…heard," "a boy…felt") and the phrase "softly adaptive" repeated without evolution trigger minor penalties. The figurative density in high-pressure moments ("trembling rope," "warm handholds," "after-echo like a pebble") borders on overwriting without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere or plot. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("scream that had decided to stay," "sunrise seen from underwater"). Two frictions lower the score: some metaphoric stacking borders on overwriting ("axis displaced," "yaw," "dial" cluster in quick succession without full clarity), and a few phrases loop conceptually ("bronze quiet" appears three times, sometimes as atmosphere, sometimes as closure image, blurring its charge). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high ("white explosions that looked like negatives," "island was a lithophone," "oars, each pull a bar in a new score") and mostly coherent, but several metaphors crowd single beats without clear payoff (lighthouse as "pen and darkroom," fortune as "tiny lantern"). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He wanted to orchestrate... to transpose life..." / "He recalled the line... realized the island..."—parallel infinitive chains across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "open secret" recurs six times with slight synonym variation ("open secret planted like a seed" / "an open secret signaling nothing and everything"), dulling precision. Information density is strong elsewhere; no outright clarity breaks. Deductions: −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops, capping at upper 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language appears in most sentences throughout, creating density without always advancing action: "echoes lingered longer than lungs," "struts of unraveled stillness," "teaching the assembly that absence can be ornament." Template cadence is present in several beats: "He pressed... He dipped... He invited... He spoke..." without variation. Paraphrase loops: "the loops began to overlap, forming chords" then "loops slowed, stretched, finally lay flat"—restating resolution across two beats. Stock metaphors: "fog," "wind through a net," "waves frozen at midnight." Information density is high but propulsion is uneven; some lines perform rhetorical work without scene momentum. The overwriting at closure (dimensional anchor groaning, whale bones, Möbius strip of intent) blurs the final image slightly. Apply −0.8 for figurative density in peak beats, −0.4 for template cadence, and −0.3 for paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "tuning fork," "palimpsest," "Devonian tides," "speaker cone," "tie-rod loosening," "batonless," stacked within beats without breathing room. Mixed metaphors cluster (the spire as tuning fork, organ pipe, speaker cone; the horizon as score, halo, and letter). Template-cadence runs appear in the memory sequence ("First memory...Second memory...Third memory...Fourth memory...Fifth memory") and movement structure ("First movement...Second movement...Third movement...Fourth movement"), reducing propulsion to checklist. Paraphrase loops: "the mirrored horizon" repeats seven times; "chronologically homesick" appears twice as ornament. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("batonless," "chronologically brave"), triggering the global 9+ disqualifier and high-band cap at 8.8 per Q7 artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.6)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is dense ("cathedral bones," "darkening brightness," "wound leak hours instead of blood") and mostly coherent, though occasional mixed metaphors emerge ("algae bred by neon rain" is vivid but the causal chain—neon breeding algae—strains plausibility). Minor template-cadence issue: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Kael [verb]," creating slight rhythmic monotony across the middle third. No paraphrase loops. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge the drop-ripple motif effectively. One clarity slip: "periodically eternal: every seventh minute it forgot its age" introduces a rule but never uses it on the page, functioning as ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies well, many lines do double work (e.g., "vibrations traveled...entering the bones of her ankles like a shy knock"). Stock metaphors appear: "tears...silver as tin," "emotion had been wrapped in felt." Template stems cluster in the closing paragraph: "She signed...He answered...Together they carried...She kept...When students arrived...But tonight." The phrase "filament of hush" recurs but shifts meaning purposefully. Clarity and propulsion are strong; minor loops and decorative phrasing prevent higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (vellum content, lichen-map function, pigeon-circuit proof compressed efficiently). Minor loop: "solitude" appears four times across the piece, twice in close proximity without functional shift—apply paraphrase-loop deduction (−0.2). Stock metaphor: "Ice traced her spine" is a bodily cliché without embodied specificity. "Layered tranquility of earth breathing" and "silvered proof" tilt decorative in peak beats, risking slight overwriting. Clarity and propulsion otherwise strong; no template cadence or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied, with strong image density in peak beats ("starlight filtered through cracks...painting everything the color of dried blood"). Several passages show paraphrase loops: "The energy beings had no texture, no weight, only presence" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "impossible choices" appears as both title and refrain without evolving meaning until the end. Template cadence emerges in the closing third: "I walked because...because...because" and "Some roads you walk because...Others you walk because..." create a drumbeat that dulls momentum. Figurative language is generally clear, though "time's texture" remains abstract despite repeated invocation. Baseline scaffold penalty (−0.6) for loops and template runs; additional (−0.3) for figurative abstraction in the peak "texture of time" refrain that never fully concretizes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or thematic motif. Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the tradition motif. Minor overwriting: "ash-slick mud," "chronic hush," "copper light," and figurative clusters in adjacent sentences occasionally pile up ("jagged ring," "tired listeners," "minor seventh begging resolution" within the first three paragraphs). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Syntax supports momentum. The density and lyric texture elevate without obscuring clarity, though the figurative load is borderline dense in the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively (short urgency: "She hesitated. The transformation was already beginning"); information density is high (coat/vials, static/wool/silk all work multiple jobs). Figurative language is controlled and character-specific ("bloomed like a bruise," "cathedral of static"). Minor scaffold appears: "She couldn't answer" is inert filler, and "the grotto now a cathedral" slightly over-reaches. The paraphrase loop "pressed the petal to her wrist" / "The petal clung to her skin" registers as −0.2, and one template stem run ("There was the grief... There was the rage... And beneath them all") merits −0.3 in Q7, totaling −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and selective sensory detail ("salt wind flapped the card catalog drawers like gull wings"), but suffers from scattered overwriting and metaphor density in non-peak beats: "necessary mirrors," "compassion, like tide, must return," "freight that must change carriers to stay afloat," and "the symphony, though ended, still reverberated in the hush between heartbeats" accumulate without clear payoff at closure. Template cadence appears in the opening sequence: "locked her ledger...followed the music...felt the familiar tug...crossed the plaza." Paraphrase loop: the final paragraph restates the cyclical premise already established ("another quiet waiver, another disguised return, another cycle beginning exactly where the last one resolved"). Information density is moderate; several beats compress transit efficiently, but the locket and envelope mechanics are somewhat expository. No clarity breaks, and figurative language remains coherent within vehicle logic.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or character. However, several lines carry template cadence or near-paraphrase: "the crystalline orchard kept chiming" / "each note a breadcrumb" / "a reminder that solitude ends" loop the closure's conceptual payload without adding pressure. The phrase "luminescent ache" recurs four times, functioning as scaffold rather than evolving motif. Stock metaphors ("dusk pooled," "shadows lengthening into one") and a filter-verb cluster in the lattice-vision paragraph ("she saw faces... all threaded") dull immediacy at a peak beat, triggering a cumulative artifact deduction of approximately −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is very high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence: "liquid lace," "silverfish fleeing a net," "breadcrumb of sound," "Möbius strip, one side memory, the other possibility." While many images are vivid, the relentless lyricism flattens propulsion in the middle third and risks overwriting. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines (the pendant's function is re-explained; the cost of borrowing time is restated). No hard causality breaks, but the cumulative metaphor load and occasional synonym churn ("accrued...borrowed...reimbursing") reduce clarity under pressure. Template stems appear in shorter runs but do not dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated register—which risks overwriting in a single-scene piece. Mixed metaphors appear: "dovetail with the dark" is abstract, "vectors of longing" mixes geometry with emotion, "turquoise memory" personifies without clear vehicle. Template cadence emerges in the middle third ("I understood then," "I realized," "I lifted") where repetitive stems flatten propulsion. Information density is strong; most lines advance atmosphere or ritual. Clarity holds despite ornate diction, but the prose does not breathe; no plain sentence anchors the lyricism, creating cumulative drag.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally controlled with varied rhythm and purposeful detail. Information density is high in the opening third (three years, mapping, ferromagnetic tape). One paraphrase loop: "the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" appears verbatim in the first and eighth paragraphs, functioning as a refrain but bordering on scaffold. The line "He had cached them for her, though he hadn't known her face until this moment" tells the thematic link rather than letting the action carry it. Filter verbs ("felt himself becoming visible") are voice-motivated and sparse. Minor metaphor strain: fragments "wanted to be heard" anthropomorphizes without clear embodiment. No major artifact clusters, but the refrain and one summary beat prevent entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("lightning spider-webbed," "leaves bearing the faint imprint of a woman's face"). Information density is high in the transformation sequence. However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "pretending to be stronger than nature itself" and "control over the uncontrollable" restate the theme; "circuitously sincere" appears twice as a phrase-stamp rather than fresh embodiment. The phrase "reluctant metamorphosis" in the final paragraph reads as labeled theme summary. Filter-verb density is moderate ("felt the mossy trellis catch," "felt their collective consciousness"), acceptable for this voice but noticeable under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent with strong images (monastery as "broken tooth," woman's fingers "gnarled like driftwood") and varied syntax. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: seven consecutive paragraphs open with "Mara [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating a predictable rhythm (−0.5). Paraphrase loops surface: "thresh meaning from experience" recurs three times without variation, and the "unearthed convergence" phrase is repeated verbatim. Stock metaphors (defeated army, breathing thing) lack transformation. The closing lines summarize theme rather than landing on a charged concrete image, reducing propulsion. Information density is adequate but the final two paragraphs rehearse established ideas rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (cave as score, shadows as tidal lines, hair as salt petals) mostly coheres, though density is high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor, risking overwriting in the middle third where "steadily unpredictable pulse," "overlapping shadows," and "bright darkness" cluster without breathing room. Two paraphrase loops appear: the cave "inhabited memory" / "every visitor's footprint a note" restates the same content adjacently, and "steadily unpredictable" recurs five times, twice within close proximity, edging toward template cadence. Information density is strong; most lines advance atmosphere and concept. Clarity holds at closure, so artifact penalties remain modest. No grammar or tense slips; syntax varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (cobblestones as words, boots as apostrophes, ink pooling like blood under scar tissue). This creates a lyric texture but borders on overwriting in the opening and middle thirds, where stacked vehicles occasionally compete (is the harbor a page, the masts sentences, the boots apostrophes—all at once?). Rhythm varies and no template cadence or paraphrase loops are evident. Information density is strong; most lines advance both search and atmosphere. The final beat's clarity holds despite compression. Penalty for figurative saturation in non-peak beats: −0.5; the closure image itself is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and the prose carries vivid images ("cedar-smelling mist," "tickets only the dead still carried"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several phrases recur with only slight variation—"starlit vault in mist," "cracks in pavement forming arrows," "phantom train ticket punch," "trembling certainty"—creating a template cadence across the piece. The repetition is pattern-taught and thematic but borders on loop in peak beats (midpoint confession sequence). Minor filter-verb stacks ("He saw," "He realized") dull immediacy in places. No causality break, so artifact penalty remains in Q7 only: −0.6 for template cadence and phrase recycling across multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do two or three jobs (e.g., "Her task was to transcribe its shifting digits before dawn, though she told herself it was only archaeological duty, not belief" layers goal, constraint, and internal conflict). The figurative language is vivid but occasionally dense in adjacent lines without clear pattern-teaching: "salt, whale song, and the jasmine scent of a garden in a memory belonging to someone named Nur" stacks three sensory channels and a nested possessive in one breath, then the next line continues with "forgotten patterns" and "keel stone." Two minor paraphrase loops: "the moment starlight touched the square, memories… surged" is closely echoed by "Each alignment softened the borders of her self," both describing permeability. The scaffold "yet she understood every grief and wonder" and "yet everything she now trusted" recycles the "yet" contradiction template. These stack to −0.8 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack, and because they appear in the first half, they disallow 9+ globally per the automatic cap rule.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("bruise inside the sky," "magnetic moans," "Möbius sigh," "choral walls") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure; this triggers overwriting deductions. Paraphrase loop appears: "The hush between thunder and echo" opening is echoed by "hush thickened until footfalls sounded like distant thunder." Template cadence in the technicians' scene: "Their whispers braided… / They spoke of Vey…" Sentence openings vary, but information density is uneven—several lines (e.g., "sandals silent on glass that reflected futures") add texture without advancing plot or choice. No causality breaks, so artifacts remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor overwriting in the middle third: "swirling ink, smelling of iron and thunder" and "the breach began quietly" lean slightly decorative. "Liquefies rigid thinking" into "policies are granite" and "liquefy into possibility" creates mild metaphor churn around the central conceit. No loops; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically ambitious and often succeeds—"roots fingering volcanic soil, branches soldered with copper wire"—but figurative density pervades most sentences without consistent payoff, triggering overwriting concerns. Mixed metaphors appear: "silence was not absence but fullness—a library of moments waiting for spines" mixes architectural and textual vehicles awkwardly. Template cadence is minimal, but several paraphrase loops recur: "earnestly studious" appears twice as a label without added pressure, and "the faint hum" is revisited without functional variation. Information density is high, yet some lines ("vibration traveled through her wrist bones, a Morse code of forgotten decades") stack metaphor on metaphor, slowing clarity. The opening and closing lines anchor voice effectively, and no major scaffold or pronoun confusion appears. However, the figurative load in peak beats (the transformation sequence, the final paragraph) crosses into opacity, and the register drifts toward elevated diction that strains the POV's internal lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors often stacked in single sentences: "death certificate crammed in her pocket, the clerical error that had erased her like a smudge of ink" and "label...fluttering like a dying moth." Some images are vivid and apt (sodium lamps as bleeding moons, containers groaning like whales), but others blur under accumulation without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "erased her" / "her own erasure" / "erased histories" / "erased stevedores" recur without evolving function. No major causality break, but rhythm flatlines in the middle third under metaphor load, and the final paragraph's "texture of memories rise beneath her skin like braille" revisits an earlier conceit without fresh charge.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("seashell vibrated, flaking pigment like sunburned skin"). However, several lines stack metaphors without clear coherence: "inside the whisper of closing pages—those last violet minutes before twilight sealed the horizon" mixes temporal, visual, and auditory vehicles. Paraphrase loops appear: "retold her sentence…letting the cello reshape it" followed by "retold that laughter" and "He retold it" in successive beats. Template cadence is present in mid-story ("Second note…Third note…fourth note"). Information density is high, but the closure paragraph ("He did not look back; the compass tugged him…") summarizes rather than dramatizes the final move. Line-level artifacts cluster in the second half, touching but not obscuring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Most lines do multiple jobs without padding ("the carnival's laughter began to sound like a countdown"). Minor loops appear: "orderly yet intuitive" is described twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure, and "still" recurs in the final two paragraphs ("still dinged," "still becoming," "Lina leaned"). The untranslated Chinese phrase "投射的火花" is a clear generation artifact that disrupts the final-third register. Information density is high overall, and the prose propels cleanly through transitions, but the artifact and mild paraphrase loops prevent entry to 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: "vitrified regolith that glittered like shattered glass under Earthrise" grounds setting and stakes in one beat. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at the shutter moment ("one by one," "fired the shutter once, twice, three") accelerate without template stems. Minor scaffold appears: "purposefully curious" repeats twice, and "dawning hush" appears three times, though the recurrence charges the ending. The final paragraph's "no margin" feels truncated mid-thought—an artifact that doesn't obscure closure but suggests a clipped ending. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks; figurative language ("paper lantern," "diluted blood") remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short commands during urgency, longer sensory description in diagnostic beats), and information density is high—most lines advance repair action, sensory feedback, or time pressure. Opening and closing images anchor well. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "decode feedback into direction" stated twice identically (motivation paragraph, then water-barrel beat); "magnetic calm" recurs without evolution. The final paragraph stacks filter verbs ("feeling sea breeze cut," "the drone shot") where stronger action could sharpen. Minor register drift ("lumen-veins," "magnetic calm," "Morse of fear") in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy, though clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (the phrasebook simultaneously anchors childhood question, polyglot motif, and tactile prop). The spiral motif (condensation, Braille-like rungs, final frost) recurs without loops. Figurative language is controlled ("throat cartilage," "rivers knitting themselves into a single silver thread"). Minor debt: "breath-born droplets" and "puppeteered by warm air" edge toward strained metaphor; "the first genuine expression the empty outpost had ever seen" anthropomorphizes the setting in a way that dilutes Maren's agency. "Worrying tranquility" in the penultimate paragraph is a stock phrase that labels rather than enacts tone.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.9)
    Information density is high and figurative language is vivid ("vacuum begging to be filled," "moonlight tastes on the tongue of a sleepwalker"). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening and middle thirds carries metaphor or elevated diction, creating a purple-prose density that obscures rather than sharpens key moments. Mixed metaphors appear ("smoke that had forgotten how to rise" coexists with "coiling through sagging roofs" without spatial coherence). Template cadence runs occur: multiple sentences open with noun-comma-appositive structures ("Elian repeated…," "He stopped…," "He pressed…"). Stock phrases like "ghosts as stories tell them" and "wild hush" recur without reweighting. Apply −0.8 for density and coherence issues; the closure beat itself remains legible, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("violet star," "wet parchment," "startled glassfish," "kelp," "bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms") and occasionally stacks without clear payoff, approaching overwriting in middle beats ("gathered hush recoiled, memories scattering like startled glassfish" follows "lilac drop drifted out, spherical and luminous"). Template cadence appears in paired participial openers ("having tasted," "carrying only"). Several lines carry abstract elevation that slows momentum: "lonesome splendor of the moment felt like arrival rather than ending" summarizes an emotional state that could be shown through image. Information density is generally strong, but the final third includes scaffolding phrases ("perpetual aria of gathered hush now threaded with fragrance") that restate prior content. No major loops, but synonym churn around "hush" and "resonance" across adjacent paragraphs slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    Figurative density is extreme and sustained across high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "hush darted ahead, a silver minnow," "copper blades that sliced the dark into slow-motion fins," "wolf made entirely of withheld truth." Mixed metaphors abound—hush as living thing, minnow, then pooling liquid. Template cadence runs through the middle: "Each cell was a chapter... each a lie... each a truth." Paraphrase loops appear: "chasing hush the way men chase fog" restated as "You chased the quiet all the way to silence." Coherence of vehicle is frequently violated (hush that is chased, cornered, leaps into chest, becomes heartbeat). Line-level opacity measurably dulls the closure image. Apply −1.7 in Q7 for artifacts touching closure and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("iron air," "tongue of a bell," "rope of memory," "petals of moonlight") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering −0.5 for overwriting. Several paraphrase loops: "the bead thrummed louder, answering something" followed by "the bead inside him beat once, twice"; "carriage overturned" and "screaming snow" recur without added pressure. Template cadence in the seven-night sequence ("On the second night... By the seventh night"). Artifacts touch multiple beats, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, multiple line-level artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("letting the dream take his legs" / "he drifted"), template cadence in the ascent sequence (repeated "past" / "until" constructions), and synonym churn ("drifted," "climbed," "descended" cycling without clear tactic shifts). Stock elevated diction appears in peak beats ("hauntingly optimistic red," "orchid solace") without grounding in concrete sensory detail. The closing third-person omniscient summary ("In overlapping dreams he saw future wanderers...") shifts into exposition that tells rather than dramatizes. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy and momentum, triggering −0.8 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is dense and imagistic, with strong specific detail (canvas satchel, oxidized copper eyes, brass mirrors). Sentence rhythm varies, though severalonstructions repeat: "she + verb" openings across multiple paragraphs create mild template cadence. The phrase "warmly curious" appears twice (roots' fingers, her smile), a synonym loop that dulls specificity (−0.3). "Across excavating a tomb" is syntactically unclear—does she spend days while excavating, or moving across the site? The penultimate paragraph ("when the season turned, travelers began") summarizes rather than dramatizing the rebuilding's completion, flattening momentum. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative texture issues prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and the prose carries vivid imagery (dust motes as tiny planets, drone shadow as eclipse). However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "the ebony clipboard" recurs five times in near-identical phrasing; "carefully inventive" bookends the piece mechanically; "codes in children's sidewalk chalk" repeats verbatim across four beats without functional reweighting. Stock metaphors ("tired fireflies," "honeyed beams") and filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("she had worked," "she understood," "she remembered") dull immediacy. These artifacts are pervasive enough to trigger −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact pack. Information density is moderate; some beats advance image more than plot.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.4)
    Phrase recycling and template cadence weaken line-level momentum: "flame from eternal candle" repeats verbatim three times without reweighting; "echoed silence" appears four times as a label rather than dramatized perception; "disguised wisdom as foolishness" is stated twice. Stock constructions ("she did not flinch," "her fingers disguised") flatten peak beats. Paraphrase loops: "conspirators' supply routes" / "supply lines, armory keys, assassination schedules" restates without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: "stars bloomed" (organic) clashes with "safe houses, loyal regiments, escape corridors" (architectural). These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("quiet stars whose names no one had yet learned to fear"), applying −1.7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.7)
    Overwriting pervades: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that obscures rather than propels. Mixed metaphors appear ("voice fierce tenderness wrapped in barnacle"). Paraphrase loops are frequent: "roots that never quite touched" echoed by "roots shifting like fingers letting go"; "healing in moonlight" repeated across beats without added pressure. Template cadence runs: several paragraphs open with "The medium [verb]" or "I [verb]." Clarity suffers under the decorative load, though grammar and tense remain consistent. These artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), triggering the upper penalty range and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and sustained: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile ("anesthetic hummed like distant shelling," "droplets…each drop a syllable," "wire ran through the bone," "trauma and translation overlapped like tide lines"). While voice-motivated and mostly legible, the accumulation flattens propulsion in the middle third; several lines paraphrase the same trauma-translation equivalence without added pressure. Minor template cadence in the list of confessions and in paired noun phrases. The final image sequence (mist lifted, coral lighter, ache holding dew) is clear and rhythmically controlled. No major loops or pronoun drift, but density without variance creates moderate momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "fog folded," "orchard light arrested mid-kiss," "fermented stars," "color planets," "pewter quilt." While many images are vivid, the clustering in nearly every sentence risks overwriting, especially in high-pressure beats where clarity would serve momentum better. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "folded time" recurs three times without new meaning. Template stems are minimal, and grammar is clean. Information density is strong—most lines advance atmosphere and action—but the relentless metaphoric layering occasionally dulls propulsion rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.4)
    Information density is high, and figurative language (silver ribbon, sound-as-visible-thing, nested Lioras) serves the conceptual design. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The nickel was the city's coinage of attention, minted whenever someone traded knowing for wondering" restates the earlier barter without added pressure. Template cadence in the "First awakening / Second awakening / Third awakening" triad reads as scaffold rather than pattern-taught structure. Stock metaphors ("like fireflies," "breathing book," "coloring-book ghosts") in peak beats reduce specificity. Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt the ground tilt," "felt her own edges soften") dull immediacy. Overwriting in the nested sequence—most sentences carry metaphor—obscures cause/effect briefly before the guide's reply clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries vivid figurative language ("orchid bees droned like tiny tax auditors," "lens swept like a scythe") but several beats loop conceptually: "candidly cryptic" appears three times without functional variation, and "converging chaos" is repeated near-identically. Template cadence is evident in the middle third ("He knelt… palming," "He exhaled… pressed," "Footsteps crunched… stepped"). The greenhouse's pollen-cloud trick and Arlo's sideways slip via "warp residue" lack concrete grounding, reducing clarity at the closure beat. Information density is moderate; several lines restate atmosphere without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high and often striking ("bioluminescent throat," "reef-shadow joy"), but overwriting pervades peak beats: multiple metaphors per sentence without clear causal propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("centuries of longing" recurs three times across adjacent paragraphs; "shyly unstoppable" applied to both breeze and glow). Template cadence: "He [verb]…then [verb]" structures dominate the final third. Stock metaphors—"hollowing blade," "dew…planetarium"—pile without clarity gain. Artifacts in the closure beat (final two paragraphs) trigger elevated deduction and disallow 9+ globally per rubric. Information density is moderate; many lines perform atmospheric work without advancing causality or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats, but figurative language saturates the text without relief: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated simile, creating a uniform poetic texture that dulls peak moments. Paraphrase loops appear: "hollow bulbs where every extinct name was once stored as vibration" then "bulbs guttered, starved for resonance" restates the same concept. Template cadence ("she [verb], [noun]; she [verb], [noun]") runs through the memory-payment sequence. The final image (tube falling, child lifting it, note escaping) propels cleanly, but earlier beats stack modifiers and mixed vehicles ("foxglove chambers of her heart," "translucent silhouette, a glass-orchid paper cutout") that obscure rather than clarify under pressure. No major causality break, so penalties remain in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("symphonies of truth," "liquid ledger," "choirs converge on the same pitch"), often appearing in consecutive sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops are present: "symphonies of truth" recurs ~8 times, "carefully reckless" twice, with synonym churn around "promise/covenant/oath." Template cadence appears in the opening third: "She had come… because trust… had snapped… and silence had grown." The final paragraph's "letter by letter, until every tongue" reads as scaffold. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but the loops and ornamental metaphor reduce propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose carries strong imagery and varied rhythm, but several artifacts accumulate. Figurative language clusters in most sentences of the opening and closing without always advancing pressure: "silver coins of light," "tuning fork," "slyly heartfelt," "grinding whisper," "dappled resolve" (repeated twice). Paraphrase loops appear: "She understood then the encrypted compassion: the founder had not chosen sides but had given the volcano itself the role of mediator" is immediately restated as "turning human discord into chords." The final two paragraphs loop thematic summary rather than resting on the image. Template cadence in the middle section: "she asked...and the amphitheater answered...When the song ended...Mireya proposed..." follows a mechanical beat. Apply −0.8 for density + loop + template in non-closure beats; −0.3 additional for figurative muddle touching the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "dust motes…slow arpeggios," "bronze throat," "pruned her branches bare," "folded herself into a dawn release of wings." While many images are vivid, the concentration in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching creates overwriting that slows momentum during key beats. The phrase "across learning to trust again" duplicates exactly, a paraphrase loop that obscures meaning. Mixed metaphors appear: "branches bare" (pruning) versus "bronze throat" (anatomy) clash in vehicle logic. Line-level clarity suffers when ornament stacks without advancing causality, particularly in the closure paragraph where summary dominates over image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("light fracture," "pages soft as moth wings," "maze that existed in the space between heartbeats") without always advancing concrete action; several beats restate the same symbolic claim in adjacent lines (e.g., thresholds remembering footsteps, then again as "the place where two stories touched"). Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [past tense]" sentence openings across multiple paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: "moved through its rooms with featherly determined steps" echoes "stepped off its western edge" without added pressure. Clarity remains intact and the closure image is not obscured, but density and recurrence slightly dull momentum in the middle third. Deduction: −0.6 for template cadence and synonym churn in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most sentences advance atmosphere or ritual action. However, several adjacent lines restate the same content: "the drowned kept their own time" and "the facility's clocks had stopped at 03:17" both convey temporal disruption; "learn the rhythm of belonging among barnacled ghosts" and the later "the way belonging feels…as reciprocal recognition" are paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("inverted rainfall," "horribly beautiful orrery") is dense but mostly coherent. Template cadence is avoided and sentence openings vary. The scaffold around the ritual sequence ("Realizing…," "Determined…," "She understood then…") slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("her doubt bruised indigo," "dawn sometimes smiles while burying the stars," "memories like foam trails boats"), but the texture occasionally tips toward overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction, which flattens rhythm in high-pressure beats. Minor loops: "cheerful gloom" recurs three times with slight variation; "transliterated" appears four times in similar constructions. Sentence openings vary, and spatial choreography is coherent (kneeling, touching ash, arranging shards, following the ribbon). The final paragraph shifts into summary mode ("Thus Lira... continued") rather than maintaining scene propulsion. No major clarity breaks, but density and scaffold reduce momentum in the closing third.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense, with many sentences performing multiple jobs (e.g., "the teen named Lila hunted her runaway ferret, flashlight beam wobbling; Cipher had noticed her earlier, how she counted ferris-wheel revolutions aloud, analytical in her own feral way, perfect vector for tonight's experiment" anchors Lila, her trait, and Cipher's tactical assessment in one move). However, figurative density in high-pressure beats borders on overwriting—"soapy water sheeted…reflecting galaxies…making the arcade seem suddenly afloat on its own private cosmos" stacks metaphors when clarity would serve escalation better. Minor paraphrase loop: "orchestrate serendipity" and "ordering randomness" are conceptually restated across paragraphs without added pressure. These issues, concentrated in the climax, pull the score to mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Multiple beats, however, exhibit template cadence: "She began by dancing…," "She danced faster…," "She halted…," "She walked…," "She smiled…" across adjacent paragraphs. Overwriting is present in stacked metaphors—"absence refused to remain empty; it grew teeth, chewed at her ankles" followed immediately by "Tonight the air tasted of obsidian grace, smooth and cutting." Filter-verb reliance is moderate ("felt the moment," "understood she had become"). Information density is high but some lines paraphrase: the concept of "fledge" is restated three times without adding new pressure. Apply template-cadence and paraphrase-loop penalties: −0.6 total in Q7, with artifacts touching the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm is generally controlled with varied sentence structure, but several phrases loop conceptually: "read between lines—of light, of wood grain, of the things people refused to say" restates the same idea three ways without adding pressure. "The prism atrium in mist" appears twice without clear meaning or differentiation. Figurative density is high throughout ("ribbons of silver fire," "ledger entries written by the night," "blades of color") without pattern-teaching or sufficient payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty. Paraphrase-loop check flags adjacent restatements in the opening third. Information density is strong in places (the three memory-images) but scaffold phrases ("she understood the assignment," "reckonings complete") externalize rather than embody. Applying −0.6 for figurative density and −0.2 for paraphrase loops, plus minor clarity drag.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid, but density becomes a liability in high-pressure beats: "the moment innocence became currency spent in smoke," "reflecting deeply until the ridge dissolved into the mind's darker forest," and "hard softness" recur as abstract intensifiers without concrete anchoring. Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("instead of a pulaski…instead of water," "not accusing but inviting"). Paraphrase loop: the notion of translating pain into language is restated across multiple paragraphs without new pressure. Mixed metaphor: "fire writes in verbs" pairs uneasily with "every tree was a question." These artifacts touch the closure third, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the rule.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and vivid ("tide gnawed stone into glass," "scent of unopened mornings"). However, several lines loop or restate without added pressure: "lucidly watchful" appears three times with minimal variation; "creating patterns with decorations" is repeated verbatim; "the next trial balloon" echoes prior phrasing. The final paragraph stacks "the next" three times in sequence, reading as template cadence. Figurative density is high throughout (every beat carries metaphor), occasionally obscuring causality ("memory maps: every shell a collapsed possibility" is asserted, not dramatized). No single artifact breaks clarity, but cumulative drag prevents higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance discovery, image, or conceptual reweighting. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("She realized," "She understood," "She reached") but does not dull the closure beat. A few figurative constructions verge on overwriting ("laughter a hollow skull," "mouth open in a scream she could not yet remember") but remain legible and voice-coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold in the final third; propulsion holds through the descent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "borrowed heartbeat," "clock-keeper," "mirrors cruel enough," "shy prophets," "taller than grief," "moth against glass," "cadmium hope, ultramarine longing, ochre forgiveness." Mixed metaphor: mirrors "waited like a jury" then become "shy prophets." Paraphrase loop: "persuade mirrors to show possibilities" / "mirrors kept undoing her work by insisting on flat truth" / "teaching it to beat in rhythms of maybe." Template cadence in middle section: "She [verb], [participle]" repeated across four sentences. Artifacts touch closure ("weaving new futures," "cut glass into grace"). Apply −1.4 for density + coherence + loops, plus −0.3 for closure contamination = baseline ~4.6.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is largely clean with purposeful imagery (obsidian veined with silver, blood-ink on lily petals). However, the piece suffers from pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries figurative or elevated language ("the terrace drinking in starlight," "echo them back until they became a chorus, a lament, a lullaby"), creating density without escalation. Runs of parallel construction ("not a negotiator, but a gardener"; "not symbols of victory, but of shared wounds"; "not forgetting, but remembering rightly") become template cadence. The paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph ("not ended the war; transformed it" / "not paid once, but daily") dulls momentum. These artifacts don't obscure causality but flatten propulsion across multiple beats, triggering accumulated line-level penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance image, character calculus, or thematic charge. Rhythm varies well—short declaratives at peak moments ("So he did what the map demanded"), longer spirals during reflection. Minor template cadence appears in mid-section ("he had financed," "he had bribed") but does not obscure closure. Figurative language is dense ("guilt calcified," "echo traveled, preserved not in the world but in the one") and occasionally risks purple ("bruised purple," "fractured grace, sharp as glass yet trembling like a lullaby"), though the accumulative lens allows elevated texture when it builds pressure rather than deflecting it.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("sanctuary rose like a frozen teardrop," "mercury tears into tiny stars that orbited her throat"), but many beats stack metaphor without breathing room, risking overwriting in high-pressure moments (core-opening, stepping into the mirror). Template cadence appears in repeated stems: "She had learned," "She worked quickly," "She repeated it until." Paraphrase loops: "the prism sanctuary collapsed into sand that chimed like distant bells, its duty fulfilled once the threads of conformity lay unravelled and harmless" restates the unlocking without new pressure. "Bodily poetic" and "alarming serenity" recur as motifs but also as filler when the line does not advance action. Apply −0.8 for density + template cadence + loops; the figurative muddle does not touch the closure image directly but dulls momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy density of figurative language in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "smoke curl into equations of regret," "translucent marionettes," "stardust that settled on his parchment-like skin." Mixed metaphors (smoke as equations, then marionettes, then stardust) violate coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops cluster around theme: "ethical storytelling" appears in varied phrasings across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence is visible in repeated parallel constructions. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("holding space," "necessary friction that generates new scripts") clashes with embodied action. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final manifesto paragraph), triggering the escalated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high and occasionally muddy: "bowl of emerald ferns suspended in sky," "roots transiently rooted" (tautological phrasing), "building temporary structures as signals to whatever spirits still listened" (vague vehicle). Template cadence appears in several paragraphs: "She thought…," "She watched…," "She had…," "She descended…" Paraphrase loop: "her work done" / "her satchel lighter" / "heavier by a hundred stories" restates completion three ways. The final sentence cuts mid-word ("of the bl"), an apparent truncation artifact. Apply −0.6 for density and template stems, −0.3 for the paraphrase loop, −0.4 for the truncation touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "aurora pulsed like a slow heartbeat," "hoarfrost forming," "blotting paper drinks ink," "razored clarity." In peak beats (rope lifting, voices unfolding) the metaphoric load remains legible but crowds nearly every sentence without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that differentiates this density from lyric habit. Template stems recur: "I + past action" across multiple paragraphs. "Technically gentle" appears twice without motivation. Information density is strong (each line advances ritual or stake) and no paraphrase loops are present, but the sustained figurative register in a high-pressure closure beat crosses into overwriting without clear payoff for this exact density level.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "map folding itself into a paper bird," "circuits branching blue across her ribs like veins of forgotten policy." Rhythm varies purposefully, and information is tightly packed. However, several beats repeat concepts without added pressure: "storm is also dreaming" echoes "storm approaching"; "neither future nor past but the hinge between" paraphrases the opening description. Template cadence appears in the travelers' epilogue: "They will wake… they will feel… None will know." These loops and the high metaphor load in peak beats (−0.4 density, −0.3 paraphrase) lower the score, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm is lyric and varied; opening lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Figurative language is dense—"time tasted of copper and ash," "numbers seemed to lift...into a lattice of light"—and mostly coherent, though "empirically ironic" strains as both adjective and thematic label. Two paraphrase loops: "the palace breathing...murmuring equations" restates palace-as-living-entity without added pressure; "the astronomer's motivation sharpened: he meant to seal a covenant" repeats the frame. Template cadence in mid-section: multiple sentences open with subject-verb-object parallelism ("Naram-bel carried," "He spread," "Naram-bel crossed"). Stock phrasing: "tears salted his lips," "heart beat with encrypted devotion." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching, creating density that occasionally obscures rather than propels ("shifting grace accepted the currency of recalled tenderness," "flood their biology with pre-war joy"). Two paraphrase loops: the sanctuary's transformations are restated across multiple beats without new pressure, and "cellular memory" is invoked repeatedly in similar phrasing. The closure image is clean, but mid-story artifacts dull momentum. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("aurora of childhood laughter," "silk collapsing into a needle's eye") but appears in nearly every sentence, creating textural overload in high-pressure beats. Several lines loop conceptually: "erase boundaries" is restated multiple times without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates purposefully. No major clarity breaks, but the density dulls propulsion in the corridor sequence where stakes are highest.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "deciduous vows that had fallen like leaves," "time persisting like sap in winter," "roots coiled around corbels," "photosynthesize into hope." While many images are vivid, the sustained metaphorical register in nearly every sentence creates a textural sameness that dulls propulsion—peak beats (grafting, barring elders, daughter's arrival) receive the same ornamental treatment as transit moments, flattening narrative urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: "the orchard would decide when to forgive" / "even broken contracts can photosynthesize into hope" restate the same thematic claim. Template cadence runs: "She set... and waited," "She cracked... then she lashed," "Word spread... and elders arrived." No clarity breaks, but information density suffers from decorative phrasing where concision would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is densely figurative with inventive images ("galaxy-fruit," "time folded like origami"), but metaphoric density in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (mirror corridor, orchard transformation, merging with the page) triggers overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "she had recorded every anomaly, yet none unsettled her" / "the cameo was not blank but waiting" restate without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("She pressed…She lifted…She stepped…She tucked") and synonym churn ("bewildered," "brightened disquiet," "existential steam") reduce momentum (−0.6 cumulative). Register drift into philosophical abstraction at closure beats ("the curator is the catalog," "the reader who realizes she authors herself") clashes with POV lexicon (−0.4). Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "carefully resourceful" appears twice as a label; "unheard symphony" is recycled in identical phrasing across four paragraphs. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She carried…," "She descended…," "She filled…," "She turned…"). Stock metaphors cluster without pattern-teaching: "corridors spiraled like a staff line," "air tasted of unheard symphony," "ink-flowers that opened when Elara whispered." Filter-verb stacks ("she reminded herself," "she offered," "she proposed") dull immediacy in peak beats. The closure beat is obscured by summary ("released the absences, watching them drift") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.2)
    Density and figurative saturation create significant drag. Nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated abstraction without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5 to −0.7). Paraphrase loops appear: "the twin placed the card against her chest where her sister's face bulged beneath the skin, and together they recited" closely echoes "she followed, knowing she must recapture," both restating intent without new pressure. Template cadence is pervasive in the long appositives and parallel "X became Y" constructions ("children ate cotton candy that became their own hair," "barkers cried prizes that exploded into pigeons"). Register drifts into academic abstraction ("tense—past imperfect, forever growing") that clashes with the fable frame. Clarity suffers: "trapped freedom surged through its hull" and "lions of light pacing behind bars of forgotten laughter" pile vehicles without coherent tenor. Artifacts touch the closure beat (the final emerald lily sentence), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("orderly cannibalism of seconds," "negative space in every ledger," "hollow tooth in the jaw of chronology"). Information density is high. Three penalties cluster in Q7: (1) Paraphrase loop: "Yet the absence persisted, a negative space in every ledger, a hollow tooth in the jaw of chronology"—two metaphors restating the same idea adjacently (−0.3). (2) Overwriting: metaphors appear in most sentences of the ritual sequence without pattern-teaching, occasionally muddling clarity ("bleeding wax into the hemp until crest and cord merged into a single crimson script" is vivid but borders on mixed vehicle when letters "rise" and "sink" into fiber immediately after) (−0.4). (3) Stock phrasing: "door that shouldn't exist" appears three times; "warmly methodical" twice; "the space between" recurs four times without reweighting (−0.3). Cumulative artifact load: −1.0, capping near 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, with most sentences advancing setting, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies and accelerates during the dome sequence. However, "gently luminous" appears five times across the text, creating a minor loop that dulls specificity; "bloom of hush" recurs in a way that occasionally feels stock rather than reweighted. Template cadence emerges in adjacent beats: "She knelt, exhaling slowly... She lifted a shard of ice... She wrapped the echo chamber stone..." applies a repetitive stem structure that flattens propulsion mid-story (−0.4). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "hammered repose" as both noun phrase and descriptor borders on strained. No causality breaks or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is ambitious with strong individual images ("fracture edges warm as if remembering light," "ringed husks of shopping malls where vines spelled unreadable names"). However, figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence of several beats without clear pattern payoff, triggering the overwriting check (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "sky's black fabric" paired with "hole" works, but "dawn pressed its cheek to the walls" anthropomorphizes inconsistently with the pavilion's mechanical logic. Sentence openings vary well. No paraphrase loops, but elevated diction ("corroged" likely meant "corroded") and occasional register drift ("coincidence folding into sense") slightly obscure momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, interiority, or the central dilemma. Rhythm varies purposefully, with shorter beats at peak moments ("She closed her eyes and conjectured"). However, figurative language saturates most lines without pattern-teaching a lyric payoff that distinctly shifts at closure; metaphoric density ("borrowed memory," "solid fog," "living manuscript," "gentle accretion," "unfinished sea") risks ornamentation that slows propulsion in high-pressure beats. Minor template cadence in the final third: "She walked," "She breathed," "She turned" across adjacent paragraphs. No paraphrase loops or grammar errors. Clarity is maintained, but the unrelenting elevation trends toward overwriting in peak moments where leaner syntax would sharpen thrust.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout (stone petals, corked heavens, mosaic tiles as teeth, black sand as fireflies), which charges many images but occasionally blurs clarity in peak beats—"filtering memories...through ambient awareness, letting the lost starlight pool behind her eyes" stacks metaphor without grounding the action. Paraphrase loops appear: "the air itself felt corked" and "some great hand had stoppered the heavens" restate the same concept adjacently. Template cadence runs emerge in the middle third ("She struck flint...sparked leapt...which bloomed...the rocket's tail caught...the shell lifted"), and several sentences open with participial structures in sequence. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags under decorative layering in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. The piece commits to its lyric register and sustains it without collapse. However, pervasive overwriting taxes clarity: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or abstraction ("throat between worlds," "texture of time," "memory-forward," "grotesque," "native tongue," "cocoon," "tidal," "slippery yet luminous"). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph nine writes "texture" and then restates the concept, paragraph eighteen echoes "texture of time" again. Template cadence in early paragraphs ("She was warmly observant," "She set the jade cicada," "She dipped her finger") and synonym churn around "time" and "texture" add cumulative drag. Several beats describe rather than advance pressure, flattening momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images anchor voice and closure. Information density is high in collection beats. However, figurative density is unrelenting: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor ("gilded hush," "intangibly tangible," "audible colors," "membrane clung"), and some vehicles contradict (hush is "thick as honey yet weightless," planks "yield like memory" then "firm into certainty"). The phrase "intangibly tangible" recurs without functional shift. Clarity holds, but the prose leans decorative in middle beats ("roots dangling like chandeliers," "porcelain chrysalis") where plain action would tighten momentum. No loops or scaffolding, but template lyricism ("tasted of X," "sprouted," "bloomed") accumulates.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative density ("frozen sigh," "seamstress," "constellation") is high but legible and voice-motivated. Information density is strong: most lines advance ritual, character, or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines frame voice and stakes cleanly. Weaknesses: "fluidly logical" appears twice (para 2, para 24) as near-identical phrasing; "the sky itself exhaled" and "single, breathing corridor" recycle breath imagery without added pressure; "voice the loudest thing inside you" and "weigh it against the sky" edge toward elevated abstraction that risks register drift from the concrete storm glass mechanics. Template cadence in paragraphs 9–10 ("The commuter gripped… Nilo did not scold… Wind, previously… The storm glass faded") creates a brief drumbeat. Cumulatively: −0.6 for loops and figurative overlap, disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "pulse of history" / "collective memory flow through her," "wisely adventurous" / "brave enough," "twisted through dimensions" / "corkscrewed upward through solid rock." Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She [verb]… she [verb]… she [verb]" across three consecutive paragraphs. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching—almost every sentence in the opening third carries a metaphor or simile, muddling clarity. Stock phrases abound: "layers of paint that had peeled like old skin," "drop of frozen blood," "geological strata." Architectural impossible: a spiral staircase "corkscrewing upward through what should have been solid rock" is described but never grounded in spatial logic (−0.8 cumulative for loops and density, −0.3 for register drift).

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and momentum is steady, but several paraphrase loops appear: "suffocated under the weight of being loved too much" / "the crushing expectation of being their perfect son"; "She burned every bridge carefully" echoes "each one a bridge she had carefully burned"; "threshold" recurs eight times, some ornamental. Figurative density is high throughout ("memories burned like embers," "candle about to die," "words falling like stones"), occasionally muddling register. The opacity does not break causality but dulls propulsion in mid-beats. Apply −0.8 for loops and density; cap at 6.9 per artifact spread.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("promises could photosynthesize into debt," "multiversal interest rate") with strong individual images but occasional metaphor strain: "borrowed lumens," "perpetual webinars dimension," and "borrowed gravity" mix vehicles without clear physical grounding. Template cadence appears in the glitch-text beats: "we forgive us," "we outnumber them," "squeeze harder" stack parallel imperatives. Paraphrase loop in opening: "pressure inside her chest" → "air tasted of copper spores and unpaid invoices" → "every breath reminded her that promises could photosynthesize into debt" recycles debt metaphor across three sentences. Information density is high but scaffold phrasing ("the one who had refused," "the farm's irrigation pipes hummed") adds word count without advancing pressure. No grammar errors; punctuation is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("golden shadows pooled," "standing waves rumored to linger," "ghost-frequency that tasted of brass and rain"), creating atmospheric texture but occasionally obscuring propulsion in peak beats. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but several lines restate concepts metaphorically without adding pressure (e.g., "eloquently silent" recurs three times without evolving meaning). Sentence openings vary, and no template cadence runs appear. The prose is clean grammatically, but information density is moderate; many sentences do more atmospheric than plot work. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors appearing in nearly every sentence ("minutes pool like spilled mercury," "armor fell away in petals of rust," "library of shapes that hummed like distant bees"). Several mixed vehicles appear: silver sap "reversing gravity" while also "coating limbs" and "sealing cracks"; the greenhouse "breathes" while also having a "heartbeat." Template cadence emerges in the middle section with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. Paraphrase loops: the knight's understanding of possibility appears three times in slightly varied form (paragraph 16, 24, 25). Information density is high but rhythm becomes uniform under the ornamental load. The final paragraph avoids these pitfalls and achieves clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies well ("She set the button," "First came a crescent," "She walked home lighter"). Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, motive, or closure. Zero scaffolding loops. Two issues lower from 8+: (1) "tactfully hopeful" recurs as a phrase-loan from the attribute list, creating slight template cadence; (2) the dust-reading sequence ("First came...Next...Then") edges toward list structure, though it serves accumulative momentum. Figurative language is dense ("sunrise over a battlefield," "slow rain of forgotten skin") but controlled and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is ambitious and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence structures and vivid images ("shadow stretching behind her like an unapproved footnote," "hollow that could be filled again"). However, figurative density is high and occasionally muddles clarity: "auric cylinder," "azimuth," "displaced voices … holding the line" layer metaphor on metaphor without grounding. Template cadence appears in sequential clauses ("She pressed… and recalled," "She adjusted… aligning… each confession"). Minor paraphrase loops (revised histories described multiple times as "erased," "edited," "replaced") and stock phrases ("tyranny of indifference" repeated) reduce momentum. The closure beat is charged but slightly obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language ("ghost looking for its own reflection," "velvet pressure," "snake devouring its own tail," "crystal balls rolling off a fortune-teller's table"), creating density without proportional advancement. Mixed metaphors accumulate: the vested hush is both fabric fraying and a sleeping animal, then becomes velvet pressure. Register drifts into academic abstractions ("negative space," "micro-tonal echoes," "spectral voices") that clash with the grotto's physicality. Paraphrase loops appear ("dewdrops form" recurs three times with minimal variation). Template cadence runs: "He [verb], [modifier]" structures repeat across paragraphs. Information density is high in places (the atrium's sympathetic tuning altering his tactics) but clarity suffers under the figurative load. Apply −1.2 for density and coherence issues touching closure beats, and disallow 9+ globally per artifact presence in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.6)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("fragrant mulch that smelled of peat"). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "emerges transformed always" appears three times without clear payoff, "mossy" recurs decoratively ("mossy delight," "moss-covered," "moss still freckling"), and the opening's "orderly seed sorter" structure is echoed in "the orderly seed sorter became the first Keeper." The phrase "mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds" mixes plant metaphors without clear vehicle logic. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or distinct escalation. Paraphrase appears in adjacent beats: "Each monument stood for something the world had forgotten" and "invitations to remember" restate the same content. These artifacts dull momentum in peak passages, triggering −0.8 for patterned loops and mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances image, stakes, or motif—and figurative language (mercury ladder, green snow, ashes refusing to fall) is vivid and mostly coherent. However, "ashes" recurs as a motif vehicle in seven distinct phrases ("ashes of his certainties," "beneath the ashes," "ashes of routine," "ash that refused to fall") across the piece, creating pattern-taught repetition that charges closure but risks synonym churn. Template cadence appears in the final third: "He left... climbed... locked... walked" and "They said... And that if... Then he'd pull." The loop of "beneath the ashes" in multiple contexts (cellar, improvise inscription, final paragraph) reads purposeful but edges toward overwriting. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density crowds most sentences ("heart-balance tilted," "mercury pooling," "forgiving light," "luminous regret") without pattern-teaching or cumulative payoff; the accumulation obscures rather than charges the closure beat. Paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of a name equals the love left over when the sound fades" restates earlier coin-weighing without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the "limit" beats with parallel structure that dulls propulsion. Stock metaphors ("forgiving light," "silent syllabus") and therapy-speak ("luminous regret") in the final third trigger artifact penalties and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence ("throat of stone," "half-lived and half-dead," "luminous ache," "liquid apology"). Several are vivid, but the accumulation flattens momentum and some vehicles are strained ("metronome against the ribs of dawn," "silence...like a second skeleton"). Minor paraphrase loop: "the giggle heard its own reflection and paused, quivering" followed by "The giggle drifted closer, reshaping itself" restates approach without added detail. Template cadence in the final third: "She closed...she pressed...both dissolved...the harp string snapped...Echo Gorge exhaled...Elara felt." Overwriting penalties apply (density without payoff −0.5, template run −0.4, mixed vehicles −0.3); total deduction ~−1.2, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is extremely high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or technical abstraction—creating atmospheric richness but occasional opacity: "proprioceptive spike twisted my knee sideways, gifting me the interrogator's smile suspended in violet air" mixes body and vision in a way that strains coherence. Paraphrase loop: "I walked deeper" and "I walked out" bookend without meaningful variation. Template cadence appears in the equation paragraphs: "The first equation…The second equation…The third equation" is mechanically parallel. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the meditative tone. Information density is high; most lines advance the arc. The figurative load in peak beats (strap removal, final walk) remains dense but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("rope bridges humming with the weight of memory," "paintings…unfasten time," "intuition…a tide"). While the images are cohesive, the relentless metaphorical layering in nearly every sentence risks overwriting without clear pattern-payoff at closure. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("I step through," "I speak," "I unfasten," "I understand") and paraphrase loop ("elusively tangible" recurs three times without evolving function). Clarity holds, but momentum occasionally stalls under decorative weight. No artifact touches the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high: lines often do double duty (e.g., "feeling paper fibers become elevator cables, hoisting her gently toward a ceiling she could not yet see" merges metaphor, sensation, and forward motion). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Two friction points lower the score: (1) Near the midpoint, several adjacent sentences loop conceptually—"She knelt, palm against warped linoleum, and felt the building's pulse—an elevator cable ghosting through the shaft of her own life, fraying one strand at a time" is immediately followed by more cable imagery, creating slight redundancy (−0.3). (2) Occasional stacked metaphors risk mild overwriting: "eyes like blown fuses," "transparent as breath on winter glass," "coat tailored exactly to her ribs" cluster without breathing room in high-pressure beats (−0.4). No scaffold loops or template cadence, and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines layer image, action, and world-rule. However, multiple paraphrase loops weaken propulsion: "the rupture was not destruction but invitation" immediately followed by "the world proposing a shorter path between heartbeats" restates the same idea; "destabilized" / "cracked" / "melted" / "listed" chains four synonyms in one beat without added pressure. Template cadence appears mid-story: "He understood then," "He saw," "He laughed," "He stepped"—four consecutive "He [verb]" openers. Filter-verb stack in final third: "saw the pattern," "understood then," "felt it etch"—three perception filters in six lines dull immediacy. Patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 for loops and template runs; an additional −0.2 for filter cluster touching closure zone. Artifacts do not obscure causality but measurably dull the closure image's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood," "dagger of light," "syllables stitched") and occasionally muddles clarity under pressure—mixed metaphors and stacked modifiers blur the closure beat. Template stems recur: "She [verb], [action], and [verb]" across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear ("the shard drank every word" / "its fractures glowing" restate absorption). The final paragraph edges into thematic summary rather than propulsive image. Rhythm varies but the elevated register holds constant even when stakes peak, flattening urgency. No severe artifacts, but density and loops accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 range.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with vivid images ("rust...drifting like bronze snow," "colors loud as trumpets"). However, elevated figurative density appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching: "the chamber became a throat for the city," "notes glowing like fireflies," "spirit resonant." Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: the chip "pulsed warm" then "grew roots of light"—biological and mechanical vehicles conflict. Template cadence runs appear: "He [verb]...He [verb]" structures repeat across adjacent lines. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or plot. Three issues lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "She called herself a petrichor collector, but what she truly gathered were beginnings—those mineral sparks that rise just before memory turns the corner" restates the collection premise without added pressure. (2) Overwriting in the final sequence: "Rain fell upward, each droplet climbing her skin, filling the vials again with something older than rain—possibility unmoored" stacks metaphors (upward rain, climbing droplets, unmoored possibility) in one beat, blurring clarity. (3) Template cadence in the descent: "Downward, the air warmed... She counted vials... until the compass tugged" uses parallel structure across three moves without variation. Proofreading is clean; grammar and tense are stable. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"throat that swallowed half the horizon," "gears of salt and starlight," "words forgiven"—without always advancing pressure; several adjacent sentences loop conceptually ("perpetually learning" recurs three times, "layered meanings" twice). Template cadence appears mid-story: "She understood then... She wedged... She began to carve..." Propulsion sags slightly when projection mechanics are explained rather than dramatized. Clarity at closure holds (archway singing, GPS drowned, skiff outward), preventing deeper penalties. No major loops or scaffolding in the final third, allowing the ending to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is lyric and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence lengths and strong imagery. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the hush inside herself, the same hush that makes nicotiana open" and "the shadow is the root of the glow" / "the dawning hush" recur as restatements rather than advancing pressure. Overwriting density: nearly every sentence in the second half carries figurative language (moon/glass/bloom/shadow), which becomes textural wallpaper rather than causal propulsion. Template cadence in the final third: "She stood inside…," "She mailed…," "Then she packed…" reads as checklist sequencing. The closing two paragraphs summarize years-later effects rather than anchoring in the present moment, flattening momentum at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance lagoon mechanics, memory discovery, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives at revelation, longer syntax during the parley). Minor scaffold: "I understood: the lagoon did not merely remember; it encrypted memory" is conceptually redundant with prior action. The metaphor "futures closing like doors" is apt but borders stock. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge effectively. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    High information density and propulsive syntax in action beats: "I struck a match on the bottle's glass; the sulfur smell mixed with brine." Minimal scaffolding, no paraphrase loops. However, elevated diction in philosophical passages ("conception of customs," "embryos of customs," "kinetic, never bottled") drifts toward register inflation during high-stakes moments, and the phrase "working memory" is over-relied upon as a conceptual anchor. The figurative density in the opening (whale bones, retort metaphor) and middle (memory as solvent) occasionally crowds without always advancing pressure, though it remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (wax shaving carries prophecy, memory, and role-inversion in tight sequence). However, repeated template stems appear across the second half: "He understood," "He saw," "He spoke," "He opened," "He straightened." The phrase "accidental prophecy" recurs four times without functional variation, and "velvet disquiet" appears twice in the final paragraph, once as ornament. Minor paraphrase loop: "the archive had inverted; the patterns would archive him" restates without added detail. These artifacts dull momentum in the closure third, triggering −0.6 and disallowing 9+ globally per the high-band artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("frost feathered," "time would pool," "silk tearing and mending"), but overwriting in high-pressure beats reduces clarity: "furiously tranquil" appears three times, "wild serenity" twice, and mixed metaphors muddle sense ("time exhaled," "fold itself into seed coats"). Paraphrase loops: the cap's warmth and summer memory are restated across two paragraphs without added detail. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" stems. Information density is high, but the closure beat's figurative pile ("silk soaked in dawn," "spirals," "crunching… tearing and mending") obscures the mechanical cost of her choice. Apply −0.6 for density + coherence issues, −0.3 for stem repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes—and figurative language is selective: "clouds surged like slow whales," "warm stones dropped into cold milk." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the climax ("At 03:59 she pressed the switch") and breathing during the aftermath. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs 2–3 restate Mara's curiosity about the siren's pitch shift without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence surfaces in the middle third with repeated "she [verb]" stems across five consecutive sentences (−0.4). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; the final line recharges "favors listening over noise" with thematic weight. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("soft meteor of grief," "dark dialects of iron and ice"), but several beats stack metaphors without clear payoff: "black water" for the vision-space, "flourishing stillness" repeated without evolving stakes, and "strength in vulnerability" becoming a thesis statement rather than image. Paraphrase loops appear in the ending: "hush of an overlooked era" recurs three times, and the final two paragraphs restate the afterimage motif and the janitor's transformation in near-synonyms. Template cadence is present in repeated "he [verb]" openings across the middle third, and the closing "And if you hike" direct-address pivot feels like scaffolding for thematic closure rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops and template patterns reduce propulsion: "tranquilly perceptive" recurs four times as a tag without reweighting; "unspoken words" and variants cycle without fresh detail in adjacent lines. Mixed metaphor: "weight... more than stone" followed by "thickening the paper" creates competing physical logics. Figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence ("fossils," "spirals," "disappointed bees," "honeycomb," "comb"), approaching overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. The final image is vivid, but earlier beats carry scaffold redundancy that dulls momentum before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: dust motes as "former digits," light tasting "like blood from a bitten minute," footsteps "typing Braille against his sternum." While purposeful for the Accumulative mode, the relentless metaphor load slows momentum in several beats ("steel skin peeled back like a tin flower" immediately followed by another extended image). Sentence openings show variety, but some adjacent lines paraphrase without adding pressure ("He realized townsfolk must have begun embedding messages" / "He understood then that to rediscover time was not to measure"). No major loops or scaffold, but density occasionally substitutes for propulsion. Information clarity remains high despite the ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence openings vary and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, overwriting accumulates: "the burnished hush of morning deepened, as though the sky itself had exhaled and chosen not to inhale again" stacks metaphor without clear vehicle, and "a chord so tense it trembled" is stock phrasing. Paraphrase loop: "tended the horizon with words" in paragraph six echoes "tended the fracture" in paragraph seventeen without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences begin "The poet..." or "He..." across the middle third. These artifacts dull momentum and trigger −0.6 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high and occasionally muddles clarity: "stone pillars vibrating like struck bells" works, but "footprints that filled with copper dust, a trail the island would reabsorb before the next tide" stacks metaphors without grounding the mechanics. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2–3: "decided the news was not a death sentence but a deadline" then "Final renovation—purpose: foster interspecies respect" restates the same resolve. Template cadence in the wire-wrapping sequence: "She spoke…She slept…She began" across three consecutive paragraphs. Information density is strong elsewhere; sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for mixed metaphor at closure (copper dust/tidal reabsorption).

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("cello made of bone," "time-lapse of extinction"). Information density is high; lines often do multiple jobs. Two distinct artifacts lower the score: repeated "She [verb]" stems in the tower climb (paras 9–13) create template cadence (−0.4), and the vision sequence recycles "She saw" three times in succession without variation (−0.3). The phrase "reaction, not a reunion" and "failed catalyst" risk thesaurus-itis but stay within voice. No paraphrase loops; propulsion is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, though it occasionally stacks without variation: "gloom-hill," "flower-drunk," "narrow vastness," "submerged concord" all arrive in the first third, teaching the lyric mode. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. However, several beats loop conceptually: "the narrow vastness" appears three times with only slight variation, and "dead languages" recurs in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. The phrase "the dead languages carried him" and "quiet inside him, their purpose served" paraphrase the same closure note. Template cadence appears in runs like "He spoke… He asked… He walked… He chose… He scattered," dulling propulsion in the middle third. Mixed metaphor in "soldiers' boots" being "carried by current" (boots sink) and vines "reaching for the sky like prisoners pardoned mid-sentence" (the vehicle shifts awkwardly) trigger minor coherence penalties. No artifacts obscure the closure image itself, capping deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("distance you crave to collapse," "spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise," "teaching distance how to kneel"), creating lyric texture but occasionally stacking metaphors in adjacent lines without clear escalation (final two paragraphs). Template cadence appears in the opening's list-structures and some mid-story "they X, Scraps Y" stems. Information density is strong; most lines advance image or pressure. No major loops, but elevated diction in peak beats ("courier teaching distance how to kneel") drifts from the embodied POV established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; figurative language (photons as late letters, heartbeat as whale song) clarifies rather than ornaments. Some decorative phrases cluster without pattern payoff: "blessed pariah," "hollowed heart," "dare" (sconce simile). "The twitch became a spin, and the spin became a voice" reads as efficient escalation. Spatial choreography tracks. No paraphrase loops. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("He had come," "He had never told," "He opened") but does not obscure causality. Propulsion is strong; closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated ("sky bleeding like bruised glass," "auroras writhing like hooked fish"), with no mixed metaphors that violate logic. Information density is high; nearly every line advances image, character, or pressure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates with urgency, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. One minor friction: "the unknown yawned widest" in the chess-match beat borders on stock metaphor, and "melting runes that spelled forgiveness" leans abstract at a closure-adjacent moment, but neither obscures causality. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn; propulsion is steady and paragraphs serve purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high, with most lines advancing image, character, or thematic pattern. However, elevated metaphors cluster densely in high-pressure beats without always serving clarity—"nomadic penumbra drifting just outside the circles of lantern light" and "luminous absence" feel ornamental rather than functional. Paraphrase loops appear: the chessboard's missing pawns are explained twice (paragraph 2 and 10), and the "small gestures" motif recurs without meaningful pressure variation. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "she/they [verb]" structures. Figurative language in most sentences of key beats (Kestrel's entrance, final collaboration) triggers density penalties. No filter-verb stacks or severe artifacts touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is ambitious and textured but suffers from density overload: nearly every sentence carries layered metaphor ("like eels in a sack," "cracked bell," "taffy," "tuning forks," "sparrow's heart," "root through her chest," "silver rain," "cataract of burning alphabets"). Template-cadence runs appear in the middle third (multiple "she [past tense verb]" openers). Several paraphrase loops: "mercury-glass skin" mentioned five times, "feather" texture described repeatedly without advancing new information. The final paragraph summary ("no oracle now—just a woman going home") edges toward scaffold. Information density is high but momentum drags under ornamental weight in non-closure beats. No clarity breaks at closure itself.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice well. Information density is high in the tapestry-decoding and labyrinth-walk sequences. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "pridefully ignoring her trembling hands after each loss; when she fled to war and did not return, he blamed himself" restates causality that could be compressed; "forgiveness was not forgetting but reframing" and "useful remorse from paralyzing shame" echo the same distinction in adjacent beats. Template cadence: multiple sentences begin with participial openers ("Working by the steel-blue glow," "He traced the final thread," "He righted the king") in the second half. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "threads lifting…like a script no longer needed" mixes vehicle (textile/text) without contradiction. These issues do not obscure closure but reduce propulsion in the middle third. Deductions: paraphrase −0.4, template cadence −0.5, total −0.9 routed to Q7 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two friction points lower the score: (1) Overwriting in high-pressure beats—"bone vibrating like a plucked wire," "the price of forgiveness was not the speaking but the listening," "seam of light opening like an eye"—stacks metaphor without breath; (2) Minor paraphrase loop: "The canyon caught the words, tossed them back and forth, multiplying" followed closely by "Each ribbon carried a syllable… canyon caught the words." No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is strong; clarity holds. Proximity to −0.6 for density without pattern-payoff, mitigated by overall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats carry overwriting and mixed metaphor: "Between breaths held underwater" recurs as a refrain four times, becoming template cadence rather than pressure escalation. "Tectonic teeth grinding" mixes geological and biological imagery without coherence. "A tiny sun sinking with her" at closure is vivid but contradicts the earlier "star reversing gravity" in adjacent lines, creating figurative muddle. The final third stacks filter verbs ("saw," "felt") and abstract summaries ("meaning achieved") where concrete image would sharpen. Minor paraphrase loop: "Acid poured through the seams, yet the charm's light persisted" immediately follows "The workshop slid into the sea with a hiss," restating sinking without added detail. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and figurative contradictions touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong propulsion: "The mirror cracked at dawn" launches immediately, "keys were for people who planned to return" compresses transit efficiently, and the final paragraph's layered closure ("the painted quay kept its perfect hour forever, while above, the real coast forgot itself, wave by wave") resonates without loops. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, and stakes simultaneously. Two deductions prevent higher scoring: (1) "intimately aloof" appears twice identically without variation, creating minor template echo; (2) the phrase "the promise answering back: temporary eternity" edges toward abstract label rather than concrete dramatization. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats; figurative language (circular-saw gulls, porcelain-bell shells) remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is imagistic, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "dawn bleeding across the horizon like a wound finally allowed to close," "hands moved to the beacon's controls with the screaming tenderness of someone who has loved a broken thing too long," "purifies intentions the way fire purifies water." Several sentences restate the same conceptual claim in adjacent lines (e.g., multiple references to "vibrations of intent" and "screaming tenderness"). The phrase "screaming tenderness" appears five times, becoming a scaffold. Clarity suffers under the metaphoric load, especially in the climactic final paragraphs where the prose prioritizes lyric texture over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is exceptionally high and creates coherence issues in multiple beats: "voice like rusted water," "memory shaped like solace," "idea of the station lifted," and "geography of loss folds into a country you can finally walk across without bleeding" pile metaphoric vehicles without clear physical grounding. Several beats suffer from paraphrase loops—paragraph four ("patina bronze censer foot...green corrosion rubbing into her thigh like a bruise shaped like home") and paragraph five restate the object's symbolic weight with synonym variation rather than advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence: "She unscrewed...pried out...laid them...placed the censer foot" (and-then sequencing). The closing two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize the transformation's immediate aftermath, dulling the closure image's impact. Information density is high but often serves texture over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and most images are precise ("roots like nooses," "luminous film…like curious children"). Information density is high; lines typically advance multiple elements. However, several phrases repeat near-synonymous concepts within close proximity: "occluding nothing, revealing everything" immediately after the film "wrapped my ankles, climbing," and the final section contains minor loops (storms coming again, carrying orchard, reaching deeper/holding tighter). The figurative language occasionally stacks without clear progression—"fractured grace" appears twice in context that doesn't fully dramatize the grace aspect. No major opacity, but density could tighten in the last quarter.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character perception, or the gap catalog. Minor figurative density in some beats: "fog hums in a bell," "borrowed memories of alpine sun," "milk stirred with silver" cluster without muddle but approach saturation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The phrase "softly persistent" recurs (mist, click of lens) as a taught motif rather than churn. Clarity holds; no grammar breaks or spatial incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with good information density. Minor loop: "glimmer" and "glimmering" appear within three lines at the doorway beat. The phrase "blooming cavern at midsummer" feels ornamental rather than functional—midsummer is mentioned but never constrains the timeline. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully until the final clause, which stacks abstractions ("old life," "new") in place of concrete image. No major scaffold or filter-verb stacks, but the closure beat loses specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high across most sentences, creating texture but also momentum drag in high-pressure beats: "bleeding starlight pooled in her palms, warm as a child's fever" stacks metaphor atop image without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "the ember grotto on the ridge" repeats three times; "bleeding starlight" appears five times with synonym drift ("sky-liquid," "memory escaping the world"). Template cadence in the final third ("The disenchanted queen smiled... Outside, fireflies drifted... And though no chronicle...") flattens rhythm. Register is consistently elevated but information density suffers under ornamental layering. Pronoun references are clear; no grammar breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats. The final image—light spreading, glass singing, shadows becoming ribbons—is vivid. However, multiple template patterns cluster: "pocket-sun alchemist, whose name was Corin" (scaffold); "he understood that capturing the density of presence meant something entirely different than preservation" followed by "the shell's spiral suggested a mathematics beyond chemistry" (paraphrase loop on the same epiphany); "measuring love in milligrams of oxytocin, grief in cortisol levels, joy in dopamine spikes" (list cadence). These patterns appear in reflective beats and dull momentum before the final turn. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loop, plus minor deduction for figurative density in non-peak beats ("elastic as caramel," "like a bird trying to escape").

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    High information density and vivid figurative language ("edges curled like autumn tongues," "mouth open like a broken shutter," "snowflakes landed like white ink"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the eagle-flight beat and breathing in the snow-erasure closure. However, mid-story drift into overwriting: "feral nostalgia bite," "rabid dreams," "brief constellations," and "white ink" cluster without clear progression, diluting propulsion. The closure beat (scroll vanishing, stone left, lights dimming) remains clean. Small template cadence issue: "She [verb]..." stems repeat across adjacent paragraphs without taught pattern, costing −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed success: "bottled dawn," "ticking ghosts," "every measured drop would commemorate safe arrival" work, but stacked metaphors in the middle third ("watery lens," "spindle," "deliverance and duration") approach overwriting. Template cadence appears in the reflective beats ("She realized…," "She set…," "She reassembled…"). Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 11–13 restate Mira's interpretive insight without added pressure. No major causality breaks, but line-level density occasionally dulls momentum. Information density is generally high; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes well.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, memory, or weather. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (breath crystallizing, motes as luminous sentences, platform as falling moon). Two patterns approach overwriting: "the wet slap of lake water receiving a body" and "bitter leaves and lake-cold wind" stack sensory modifiers without adding pressure; "stories, unlike bodies, know how to fly" in the final sentence declares theme rather than trusting the prior image. Minor template cadence in paragraph twelve: "She remembered...how it had sounded...an echo she could still hear" cycles synonyms. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; propulsion is strong through the stroke sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "dust motes drifted like slow arpeggios," "headlines like a shroud," "rosin," "trill," "pizzicato whispers." In accumulative mode this can build texture, but in peak beats—sister's materialization, apology, drop falling—the metaphoric layering ("edges flickering like a piano chord struck too hard, pedals still pressed") competes with clarity. Two paraphrase loops appear: "imperfect miracle" repeats across three paragraphs without added nuance, and "induced currents" recurs in summary fashion. Template cadence in the mid-section ("She touched... She uncorked... She spoke...") flattens rhythm. No grammar errors; syntax varies purposefully outside the loops.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density in nearly every sentence—words "corkscrew," shelves "bow inward like accretion disks," memories "slide down the curve"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops: "the witness is the witnessed" echoes "she saw herself multiplied into every observer" without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraphs 4–7 (repeated "She [verb]" openers). Stock metaphors ("pregnant universe," "ants of ink") muddle clarity. Sentence rhythm is algorithmically lyric rather than modulating with scene needs. Information density is low; many lines restate the same cosmic-unity thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from significant template-cadence artifacts: multiple sentences open with "The hydraulic clock shepherd" or "Through counting backwards," creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops appear ("clocks didn't measure hours but rather the distance" / "not the passage of time but the distance we travel") across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching payoff—"razor edges" appears four times but never gains specificity or causal force. The final third escalates abstraction ("the thing that clocks had always attempted to quantify") into near-opacity. Information density is low; many lines restate the core conceit without advancing situation or choice. Applying template-cadence (−0.5), paraphrase loops (−0.3), and figurative muddle in peak beats (−0.4) yields the deduction, with artifacts touching closure preventing 9+ eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Syntax is varied and rhythm supports the accumulative design, but several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure: "She had come after the heart attack—her father's, not hers" / "her throat tight" are vivid, yet "clover melancholy" recurs three times without new function, and "traverse" appears four times. Stock metaphor: "lattice of love beneath the ruin" and "fracturing it into a spectrum" read familiar. The final paragraph stacks abstract summaries ("not lighter, but wider," "hold and release, mourn and move") where a single concrete image would suffice, triggering −0.6 for paraphrase loops and −0.3 for template stems in the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("glass harmonica disc shimmered brighter, as if approving the mistake"). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Some figurative language is vivid ("melodically haunted silence," "darkness that smelled of fresh ink") but occasional density spikes risk overwriting ("climbed the tunnel walls like damp ivy" immediately after "melodically haunted ring"). Template cadence appears in the middle section: "I never asked her name; names are doorways, and I had brick-walled my life" feels like thesis statement rather than embodied thought. No loops or scaffolding. Propulsion is generally strong but the extended metaphor at the opening (disc/booth/ritual) compresses setup detail that could spread across the first two beats.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. However, figurative language saturates several high-pressure beats without clear payoff: "wind carried haunted euphoria," "ink blooming like bruised violets," "sky forgets its own colors." The phrase "regenerated covenant" repeats three times with shifting referents (stones, agreement, rhythm) that blur rather than sharpen. "Steep" appears twice as verb (steep the locket, steep promise) in non-standard usage that reads as diction drift. Apply −0.6 for density without full coherence and −0.2 for register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; opening line anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high in most beats. However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "loneliness, he realized, was a station you could leave" closely echoes the later "Loneliness, measured in grams, decreased"; "desperately jocular" appears three times. Template cadence appears in some stems ("He carried… because rumor claimed"; "Kit did not believe… but he believed"). Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled; "ivy braided itself into trellis arches overnight, spelling departure times in Latin" reads vivid and purposeful. Apply cumulative loop/scaffold penalty −0.8 for paraphrase and stem repetition that dull momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is consistent and information density is high, with most lines doing double duty (ultrasonic forest both setting and sensory apparatus). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "musical notes" recurs across adjacent beats without added detail; "raised lines/raised ink" cycles; "quiet blaze" appears three times identically. Template cadence is present in repetitive "He [verb]" openings across the middle third. Several metaphors are strained or contradictory ("wet heart of silence," "platinum compass ring… drank the alphabet"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull propulsion. Figurative density is very high without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. No grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and supports the accumulative design. Information density is high; most lines layer image, action, and concept. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "story still being written." Mild scaffold detected: "meaning threshed from experience" → "experience itself arrived pre-threshed" and "confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied" loop conceptually without advancing pressure. The phrase "confidently uncertain" recurs as label in multiple beats. Filter-verb stack in paragraph two ("she had planted," "made her confidently uncertain") slightly dulls immediacy. Mixed metaphor: "filaments that tied them together" then "shimmer like spider silk" works, but "unbent the event" + "easing its curvature" mixes geometric and tensile logics without full coherence. No major loops or template cadence, but the thematic vocabulary ("contingency," "thresh," "filament") recycles enough to nudge toward −0.6 in-band. Proofreading clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high but largely coherent: "moonlight painted silver ladders," "silence the way cartographers once traced coastlines," "phosphor trail only visible where moonlight kissed salt." Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm modulates with the advisor's movement. However, several lines repeat structure without added pressure: "the clank of a loosened cleat, then the low throb of a generator, then the heartbeat he borrowed" is efficient, but the pattern recurs in "part whale, part church organ, part lullaby" without functional escalation. The final third introduces minor paraphrase loops ("the note lingered, decaying slowly, teaching the town how to listen for what had been removed" restates earlier "silence…is only music waiting"). No filter-verb stacks or register drift appear. The overwriting in peak beats (closure paragraph) is controlled but the density leans ornamental rather than propulsive, applying a −0.6 deduction in Q7 for figurative saturation without pattern-taught payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: paragraphs 2–3 restate Ember's artistic trail, paragraphs 15–16 re-explain her arson's true purpose, and the final three paragraphs cycle through the same transformation claim. Template cadence runs throughout: "She had gone…She had come…Ember's grandmother had been…Ember's fingers found…Ember understood…Ember pressed…" Stock metaphors accumulate without specificity: "burning bright," "flames licking," "consumed by light." Information density is low—many sentences restate prior content rather than advance knowledge or pressure. The closure beat is scaffolded with explanation rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high across most sentences, mixing vehicles without full coherence: "contraband metronomes," "moth wings," "liquid metal," "bioluminescent jellyfish" stack rapidly, and some contradict (memory as solid contraband, then fluttering moths, then liquid). Template cadence appears in repeated "she + verb" openers and paired clauses ("trying to anchor her…but she waded"; "no longer a fugitive…but a conductor"). Paraphrase loops: "externalize the overload, to give every stolen moment a doorway out" restates the same idea. "Conductor emeritus" and "quietly rebellious" are abstract labels in the closure paragraph. Apply −0.8 for density/coherence issues and −0.4 for template stems (−1.2 total, per Non-closure Accumulation Cap).

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, with vivid sensory anchors (violet ribbons, metallic whisper, aurora's light) and clean sequencing. However, several craft issues accumulate: paraphrase loops appear ("whispers travel farther than shouts" recurs three times with minimal variation; "the woman" is repeated as a sentence subject across adjacent lines), template cadence in exposition ("She unfolded... A metallic whisper... Mira's trained ear..."), and elevated diction that clashes with Mira's blue-collar expertise ("calculated spontaneity," "harmonic frequencies" used as poetic gloss rather than technical precision). Information density is adequate but scaffold sentences like "They walked in deliberate silence" add little. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping deduction per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, but the patterns prevent entry to high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "bruised sky," "coat spreading like a dark wing," "reflections nested like minnows," "darkness pooled, curious." While lyric coherence holds, the piece accumulates metaphor in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (mirror weaving, spiral brightening) without pattern-teaching or payoff that alters choice. Paraphrase loops appear: "She felt its attention… heavy as harbor fog" restates "darkness pooled, curious" without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]… she [verb]…" across multiple lines. Apply −0.5 for density + −0.2 for loops = −0.7 in Q7. Clarity remains legible; momentum drags slightly under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully, rhythmic control is evident ("One by one she visited..."), and sensory specifics anchor the lyric mode. Information density is high in the grotto descriptions and window-display sequence. However, figurative language saturates nearly every line—"dented tin of chess pieces like contraband," "mist carried a sharper edge," "coat collar soaked in starlight"—without escalation or pattern break to justify the saturation. The phrase "hush where past meets prophecy" recurs three times as scaffolding rather than charged reprise. Minor template cadence appears in the confession sequence: "The cashier admitted... The janitor confessed... Ellis whispered..."

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated image—which risks overwriting in a high-pressure narrative. Mixed metaphors appear: "houses creaked free, drifting like swans bred from violence now impotent" conflates breeding, impotence, and swan-flight incoherently. Paraphrase loops surface: "detach," she urged, not from land but from the myth" closely restates the prior line's meaning. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("She thought of... of... of...") and the final third's exposition ("Around her, others laughed, argued, kissed—freedom raw and alive") stalls momentum. Information density is strong, but clarity suffers under the figurative load.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image, action, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally: short beats during whittling, longer accumulation in the bouquet description and planting sequence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language ("infant made of endings," "microphone hidden in her collar," "turbines… three-armed giants") is vivid and motivated without overwriting. Minor strain: "quivered when the blades passed through their shadow, pretending to be alive" slightly over-explains. Sentence variety supports momentum, and the final paragraph's cascade of dependent clauses accelerates into the flag image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but coherent within lyric mode. Minor loop: "tremor of certainty" recurs four times without reweighting; late mentions feel like reminders rather than pressure shifts. Paraphrase slippage: "law into suggestion" and "ordinance" versus "environment" restate the same transformation within adjacent lines (−0.2). Some lines do double duty (e.g., "She recited…her version sang" advances action and theme), but sustained metaphor strings in middle paragraphs ("membrane became mist, mist became chorus") risk decorative drift. No grammar breaks; propulsion is steady but occasionally slowed by ornamental layering in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean with varied syntax and high information density. Figurative language pervades without pattern-teaching: "warped light into bruised rainbows," "colors that exist only in the cracks," "dying sang and the blind taught others to see." Several lines edge toward purple ("terrible beauty of things that survive transformation") and the final third accumulates abstract thematic statements. Minor paraphrase loop: lines 12-13 restate the marble eye's lesson ("see through the cracks rather than despite them" / "colors that exist only in the cracks"). No major scaffold or tense breaks, but the density of metaphor in peak beats (lines 12-16) risks obscuring causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.3)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "artificial pilgrimage routes" and "artificial pilgrimage" recur without added pressure; "golden shadows" appears seven times as decoration. Template cadence: "She [verb]… she [verb]…" runs across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors: "cathedral of forgotten frequencies," "voices rough with disuse," "wilted flowers." The final third stacks abstraction: "fluid, ever-changing, and beautifully artificial in its authenticity" and "sometimes the most sacred pilgrimages are the ones we invent ourselves" read as scaffolding rather than image. Artifacts touch closure (−1.7 baseline in Q7); disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "genuinely artificial—beautiful lies" / "memorials were not the people they honored but the love that survived them" restates across paragraphs. Template cadence: "She placed figures in… inside… beneath…" stacks identically across three beats. Figurative language clusters without payoff: "curtains of intention," "slipstream of lost hopes," "acoustic dome," "fabric woven from unfinished dreams." Stock metaphor "withering and blooming" recurs as label. Combined artifact penalty (−1.2 in Q7) and disallow 9+ globally; cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high (each paragraph advances mapping method or thematic reweighting). However, multiple sentences exhibit ornamental density that slows momentum without adding causal pressure: "Each droplet that struck the glass above her sounded like a coin falling into an empty wallet, a memory she could not shake" front-loads backstory as metaphor rather than present action. Paraphrase loop in paragraph three: "filled its silence" after "emptied the city's pockets" restates the absence without new detail. Template cadence in paragraph eight: "draw three, lay two reversed, rotate one ninety degrees" reads as procedure list rather than embodied action. Stock metaphor "smoke" for vanished tech-bros. The final third sustains lyric density without loops, but earlier artifacts and the occasional register drift into academic phrasing ("emergent map of collective memory") accumulate to mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density overload: "atoms of nostalgia drifted like luminous dust," "air tasted of copper tears," "freckles that would map constellations." Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]" openers recur across a dozen paragraphs. Paraphrase loops are pervasive—paragraphs 12–13, 20–21, and 24–26 restate the same thematic content. Information density is low; many lines do decorative work without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied, with sentence openings shifting between subject, clause, and prepositional phrase. However, several beats suffer from overwriting and metaphor density that obscures rather than sharpens: "dreams like pollen that glowed with luminous regret," "oceans of gold hope turning slowly beneath her thumb," and "a violet afterimage that future dreamers would sometimes glimpse" stack figurative vehicles without clear payoff. Template cadence appears in the final third: multiple sentences begin with "She [verb]" or "Mira [verb]" across consecutive lines. Paraphrase loops occur: paragraphs 10 and 11 restate the shadow's return and the stone's internalization. The phrase "softly, deliberately" recurs without variation. Information density is high in the projection-comparison beat but thins in the closing sequence. Apply −0.8 for overwriting density in high-pressure beats, −0.4 for template cadence in the final third, and −0.3 for paraphrase loops; total artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("She lifted the tail tip between thumb and forefinger, feeling the minute heartbeat pulsing through the scales"). Figurative language is vivid but concentrated in the opening and closing thirds; mid-story beats stay concrete. Minor artifact: "quietly vivid" appears three times as a phrase marker, creating modest template cadence. A few lines edge toward overwriting ("the shimmering stillness of a conviction still alive, now tenderly cracked open to the world"), though they remain functional. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is very high throughout, creating a lyric texture but risking opacity in key beats. "The stone softened into loam under my fingertips, the way flesh yields when sutures dissolve" stacks metaphor on simile mid-turn. "Scars are simply stories written sideways so the heart can keep beating" in the climax is a thematic statement rather than image-driven closure. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the elevated register and stacked vehicles ("tunnel of coffee rings," "vertebra in the spine of memory," "mason jar of clay") occasionally muddle rather than sharpen. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. The closure image (swallowing seed, pulse steady) is clean and concrete, which anchors the piece despite prior density.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent but verges on overwriting in high-pressure beats: "hushed thunder outside—storm without rain, like applause trapped behind velvet curtains" stacks three vehicles in one clause. Paraphrase loop: "love unused is not gone; it loops" in paragraph 16 is then restated as "Love is never unused, only stored" in paragraph 23. Syntactic variety is present but several lines open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" without modulation. Information density is high; most sentences advance image or action. No grammatical errors or pronoun ambiguity. The opening and closing images are strong, but template cadence ("Mara [verb], [verb], [verb]") appears in three consecutive beats mid-story, dulling momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of several beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting (−0.5). Examples: "a migraine of unborn constellations," "liquid light," "filament of remembered stardust," "ghost meridian"—each vivid in isolation but stacked without relief. Two instances of paraphrase loops: "Each footfall erased yesterday's date, melting the calendar into white silence, yet the sky kept writing new months" restates erasure/rewriting, and "She understood: the sky was not commanding her; it was warning itself" clarifies what the prior sentence already implied (−0.2). No grammatical errors or pronoun ambiguities. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Propulsion is adequate but occasionally slowed by lush description in transitional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but template cadence emerges in several beats: "The rails beneath... were memory only," "The hands pulled him upslope," "The guard understood," "He planted the clock there." Figurative density is high throughout (ember, phosphorescent poppies, wave functions, defective film frames, screaming mouth, paper lanterns) without clear escalation or pattern break; in high-pressure beats this risks ornamental accumulation rather than propulsion. Information density is strong—most lines advance atmosphere or concept—but some phrases loop conceptually: "dreams had burned" / "throats are gone" restates loss without added cost. Clarity remains high; no mixed metaphors or pronoun confusion. The final third sustains the lyric register without artifact intrusion, keeping closure legible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is extreme and pervasive: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated image ("tuning fork struck by moonlight," "mercury brook," "chlorophyll and chrome"), creating a relentless ornamental texture that flattens urgency. Paraphrase loops appear ("the hum of insight" recurs as decorative refrain without added pressure across eight mentions). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]," establishing mechanical rhythm. Sentence-level propulsion stalls under the weight of stacked modifiers and abstract constructions ("elegy for every philosopher who had traded certainty for wonder").

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    Patterned phrasing recurs across beats: "gently persistent," "shoreline lullaby," "ticket punch with star stamp," "veiled ridgeway," and "vigil in twilight" appear as near-repetitive stems rather than charged reprises. Several lines loop conceptually (e.g., "courage unused" restated across paragraphs 7, 19, 24) without added pressure. Template cadence in mid-section paragraphs ("They walked," "They found her," "Jun stepped forward") flattens momentum. Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("paw prints that appeared and vanished like breath on cold glass"). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in most beats, though the dream paragraph and some exposition ("The mark was a pale streak, left by generations...") serve setup more than propulsion. Two paraphrase moments: "He had been a child when the silence decree came down; his mother's lullaby was the last song the fortress ever heard" closely restates the opening's "every whispered prayer" setup, and the final two paragraphs loop the boy-will-climb-the-staircase idea. Figurative language is dense ("frostbitten hope crystallizing," "meltwater constellations") but mostly coherent; "seraphically mundane" for a bolt is strained. One template-cadence run in the ledger paragraph ("He stepped inside...So the bellhop did...He held...") with repeated "He [verb]" stems.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is ornate and rhythmically varied, with purposeful compression ("no taller than a candlestick," "a drop of liquid night") and vivid sensory anchors. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence—"moonlit alabaster," "cold starlight," "liquid night," "closed winter," "stone through mist"—creating density that occasionally obscures propulsion. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "regally unpretentious" is restated as "neither bowing to the dust nor demanding reverence" and again as "regally unpretentious once more"; the titan's motivation (balance, precision) is repeated across three paragraphs without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to sigh," "seemed to inhale") and passive constructions ("was dissolved," "was not carved") appear in high-pressure beats. The ornamental climax—"dust motes rose like liberated subjects, swirling into the shape of a coronet that dissolved"—prioritizes metaphor over clarity and momentum. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: −0.8 for loops and figurative saturation touching closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (white mantis, broken teeth, gull with broken wing, green tunnels, drifting moored specter) but occasionally stacks without breathing room, risking overwriting in the descent paragraphs. Two paraphrase loops: "practice of tapping rhythms" appears nearly identically in paragraphs three and fifteen; "drifting moored" recurs as both attribute and image without clear progression. Template cadence in the middle third (multiple sentences open with participial phrases or "she [verb]"). Information density is strong; most lines advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Clarity holds despite lyric compression. No grammar errors or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies well, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("cathedral of thunderous serenity," "passports" for galaxies). Information density is high, and few lines are purely decorative. However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the climax carries metaphor or elevation ("tuning fork," "resonator," "wind instrument," "plasma flowers"), creating a textural pile-up that obscures the physical action. Mixed metaphors appear: swallows as "peppercorns flung into blue soup" jars against the cosmic scale. Template cadence in the middle third: "She raised… She traced… She thought… She kneeling…" Paraphrase loop: "Remember, Reclaim, Reignite" is immediately followed by "So she did what any barefoot stargazer would do," restating intent. Artifacts in the closure third trigger the disallow-9+ rule and cap high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high (every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes). Two clusters reduce clarity: "Heat cracks the shell, water wakes the soul, read me backward as roots drink whole" reads slightly forced as in-world script, and "Implanted destiny—do not trust the council's breeders" compresses exposition. Figurative language ("galaxies," "rogue vines," "seedlings turning to sun") stays legible but occasionally stacks in single beats without payoff. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb runs; propulsion holds through the grotto sequence. Overall strong line work with minor density friction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance both image and internal state. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the freeze-exercise beat and breathing in the final covenant. Minor template cadence in mid-section: three consecutive "I think" / "I [verb]" openers create a drumbeat that slightly flattens momentum before the climax. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent—"blast as red chrysanthemum" works, "drone as distant heron" is apt—though "red chrysanthemum opening" and "gulls quarrelling" in the same beat risk metaphor pile-up. No loops or scaffold; syntax modulates with pressure. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, creating density but also slowing momentum—"pulse like a dying heart," "margins bled contradictory coastlines," "paper wings flutter" pile without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "fragmented reality" is restated multiple times across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs in rhetorical questions ("Is a prophecy still sacred," "Does a line know," "Is absence the purest pigment") cluster in high-pressure beats without dramatized answers, triggering −0.6. Register remains elevated but consistent; no grammatical errors. The overwriting and loops prevent high-band access despite local vividness.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "serene anger" recurs three times without added pressure; "disappear/vanished/vanishing" cycles across adjacent beats; "consciously wild" is reused identically. Template cadence at the ending: "They had discovered…" launches multiple summary statements. Figurative language clusters densely without pattern-teaching ("fractal spirals," "folded like origami," "stretched like taffy," "fish through water"). The final third relies on exposition ("She had become…," "He understood then…") that summarizes rather than dramatizes pivotal realizations, creating momentum drag and clarity loss at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance situation, stakes, or imagery. Rhythm modulates well between the taut upload sequence and the slower opening and closing frames. Several friction points lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("dizzying quiet" recurs three times, always with similar phrasing; "contraband truths" is repeated verbatim across multiple beats without variation), and a few lines carry template cadence ("She remembered why she had accepted endless cold: to preserve every story, not to bury..."). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "live coal in the sub-zero gloom" (coals require oxygen and heat, unlikely to stay live in cryo conditions). Stock phrases cluster in the final third: "half ice, half fire," "the blink that follows surprise" (used twice), "reborn or... purified by flame." The closure image itself—pod sealing, promise to the books, wind carrying words—remains clear and propulsive, but the surrounding lines carry slight overwriting. Syntax varies well; no major grammar or tense errors.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("petals like burnished copper," "faint pulse of roots taking hold"). However, overwriting clusters in several beats: "engraved quiet" as metaphor strains coherence, and "senselessly perceptive" is awkwardly coined. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "She [verb]" stems across adjacent paragraphs. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs discussing "inculcating plants with values" restate the concept without advancing pressure. Information density is high in the grafting sequence but thins during expository reflection on her parents' philosophies.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and figurative language is purposeful in most beats, but density approaches overwriting in high-pressure moments: "eyes black holes that sucked in lullabies and screamed them back as feral lullabies" stacks metaphors without clarifying the threat, and "zigzag of sonic vines that recoiled from her calm, unable to feast on the pulse she refused to quicken" blurs causality under ornament. Minor paraphrase loop: "sleepwalking into the fissure" echoes "sleepwalkers tangled in their own glittering nets" without added pressure. Clarity at closure remains intact (the spike warm with starfire, the walk home), so non-closure deductions are capped at −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "orbit of regret," "headlines trailing subheads like cometary debris," "shards became starlings." Many images are vivid but several verge on mixed metaphor (orbits don't "tip their hat"). Template cadence appears in the descent sequence: multiple "she [verb]" constructions. Paraphrase loops cluster around the theme: "regret becoming merely another planet" echoes "stories keep orbiting" without added pressure. Information density is strong in the ritual beats but the final third recycles the orbit conceit. Clarity holds; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is ambitious and imagistically dense, with striking local constructions ("the sky swallowing its own fire," "paper chain that wrapped her wrists"). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating a uniform lyric texture that flattens rhythm and slows momentum. Mixed metaphors and strained vehicles appear: "haunted firmware" in crib mobiles and "sleeper code" mix software idiom with supernatural archive without coherent world logic. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The" + noun ("The tattooist's gloves," "The console's screen," "The amber insect," "The letters converged," "The menu refreshed"), creating a drumbeat that becomes predictable. Paraphrase loops: "Time folded" recurs twice without added pressure. Information density is high but clarity suffers under the metaphor load. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for density + template cadence + mixed metaphor, and note that artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("Time unfolded; the laboratory drawers closed"), triggering the −1.7 adjustment and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful, but density of metaphor in adjacent lines occasionally blurs propulsion: "emergent hush," "lilac unease," "congregation of absence," and "mute frequency" cluster without always advancing new information. Template stems appear: "She had wandered," "She answered," "She laughed," "She walked," "She worked"—a reliance on subject-verb openings that flattens sentence variety in places. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Clarity holds, grammar is clean, and the final image ("pockets light, ears open") lands with precision. Information density is strong in the mandala beats but thinner in the closing paragraphs, which reiterate theme rather than compress it.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent. However, several passages loop conceptually: "what mercy existed in choosing who deserved to remember" is restated as "greatest mercy lay...in what we allowed ourselves to forget." The phrase "empathy's armor, cradling the capacity for understanding in arms of steel" mixes metaphors (armor/cradle/arms). Template cadence appears in the opening: "had spent...had proven...had once been...had watched." Minor filter-verb stacks ("She'd watched," "had seen") dull immediacy in peak reflection. Propulsion is adequate but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; sensory layering is vivid ("buttered popcorn, rosin, moth-eaten brocade"). However, persistent overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "minutes fracture into colored ribbons—citrine applause, indigo silence, rose regret" and "echoes that were also scents" stack figurative language without advancing pressure. Two paraphrase loops: "the coin still hummed with that forbidden flavor" after describing the seamstress's synesthetic experience, and "the fractured timeline sealed into a continuous present where every performance was happening at once" restates the earlier folding metaphor. Template cadence appears in the orchard sequence: "He mounted... He flipped... The threads lifted... She raised... He caught... He tied... He began..." The closure image is clear, but figurative density in the ritual (18–22) obscures causal linkage. Deductions: −0.6 for overwriting density, −0.4 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence = baseline ~7.7, adjusted to 6.3 with cumulative artifact impact on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are evident: "The static shock had activated something" / "Tonight, after the static shock, those pathways suddenly made sense" restates the trigger without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" sentence openings. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "sanctuary," "hidden pathways") accumulate without fresh texture. The montage section ("Working through the night," "word spread quickly") compresses pivotal beats into summary, reducing information density. Figurative language ("fractally precise," "willowglass hope") is used decoratively without grounding in concrete action, violating the overwriting density check.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong images ("salt-curtains," "leaf blazed like a newborn star," "staff floated a finger's breadth above ground"). Information density is high, and sentence openings vary. However, several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the hush of apple orchards at first frost, the hush that follows a final lullaby"), synonym churn ("silences" repeated across adjacent beats without added pressure), and template cadence in the middle section where interiority stacks elevated abstractions ("ache older than grammar," "bridge that refused either shore"). The final paragraph delivers a micro-essay on legacy rather than scene pressure, diluting propulsion. No grammatical errors, but the figurative density in peak beats (inversion, radiance, sound-as-weather) occasionally obscures cause-effect timing.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high and often striking ("sky was the color of old copper," "prophecy began to leak") but several images mix vehicles without coherence: "molten glass" clashes with "amber walls" physics, and "unearthed silence that settled over buttons like dust" asks silence to behave as particulate matter. Template cadence appears in the final third: "She walked on... She pocketed... She lifted... She sealed..." across four consecutive moves. Paraphrase loops emerge: "cataloging lost buttons" → "she found generations of them" → "she laid them out... grouping by material, by century." Information density is moderate; many lines perform double duty (sensory + thematic) but the closing two paragraphs summarize forward action rather than dramatizing the village encounter or the monastery arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in tactical beats (pillbox battery jump-start, burst transmission spoofing). However, recurrent phrasing creates template cadence: "silver hush" appears three times, "tilted/tilt" four times, and "prudently daring" is echoed in the bandage line without added pressure. The phrase "Where unused courage waits, the snow remembers" functions as thematic anchor but is paraphrased across multiple beats ("to find where unused courage waits," "He did not know where unused courage waits"). Stock metaphors appear under stress: "dying star flinging its atoms outward," "white flag of a season." Figurative density in the final third (zephyr, snowdrop, silver dust, snow-soft signal) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching. No hard causality breaks, but the loops and stock images dull propulsion at closure. Applying patterned-artifact baseline (−0.6 for recurrence + stock metaphor strings) and template cadence (−0.4) within Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and imagistic density, but suffers from pervasive overwriting that slows momentum. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching: "like a palimpsest promise," "percolate through ambient awareness," "spindrift serenity," "chrysalis," "parchment torn to let moonlight spill through." Mixed metaphors cluster: the seat "breathes," fog is "pierced" then "siphoned," thread "unspools" but also "wounds back." Register drift is evident in phrases like "percolate through ambient awareness" and "ambient awareness of a forgotten kettle," which read as writerly constructs rather than the coachman's lexicon. Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "he [verb]" and "until [noun] became [noun]" structures. No paraphrase loops, but the density of ornamental metaphor in peak beats (the needle threading, the sphere forming) reduces clarity. Apply −0.8 for density and coherence issues across multiple beats, plus −0.3 for register drift, totaling −1.1 before adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is ambitious but uneven. Figurative language is dense and often effective ("honey turned to ash," "leaves angled like cupped palms," "torn silk" timelines), but several sentences stack metaphors without full clarity: "She walked by following sun patterns that now lived inside her eyes, each step a thrum against the wasteland's refusal to heal" compresses three images in quick succession. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She + past-tense verb" across the middle third ("She saw," "She saw," "She knelt," "She set," "She lifted," "She tasted"), creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loop: the oasis exhaling, hives glimmering, and bees returning are restated across two paragraphs without added pressure. No major grammatical errors; syntax is clear. Information density is high, but some lines work harder on texture than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several images land with precision: "tiny eviction notice," "pull, lift, glide," "diesel and starfish." Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence—blade against skin, heartbeat slosh, tarpaulin wings, midwife shoulder, scatter of seeds, silver chains, moon combing hair—creating density that occasionally stalls momentum in high-pressure beats (the lock-picking, the descent). The oar-rhythm refrain borders on template cadence across three uses. Minor paraphrase loop: "quivering hush" recurs without added pressure. Pronoun references and spatial choreography remain clear. No major grammatical errors. The final image is strong, but pervasive metaphoric density and some stock poetic constructions ("voice wrapped in protected vulnerability") lower the score. Apply −0.6 for density and pattern in peak beats, per overwriting checks.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance image, choice, or resonance. Rhythm varies across beats (short declaratives at the refusal, longer accumulative sentences in flight). Overwriting check flags elevated diction density in peak beats: "atomically reflective," "alchemize," "cartographer," "prismatic shards"—register drifts toward ornamental in moments that warrant sharper immediacy. Paraphrase-loop detected: "let us live through you, let us share the weight" and "the offer was seductive, a chorus that promised she would never be alone" restate the same pressure without added detail (−0.2). Template cadence in the final third: "She stepped," "She launched," "She climbed," "She tucked"—four successive "She [verb]" openers (−0.4). No loops touch the closure image directly, so accumulation cap applies. Grammar and pronoun clarity are clean; no typos or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile ("petals—carved from moon-white stone," "a brittle helix that had once cradled someone else's future," "a tiny spinning galaxy of fiber and memory"). In peak beats—oculus projection, color weaving, doves scattering—the stacked imagery risks obscuring propulsion rather than advancing it. Template cadence appears in several moves: "She stepped…each footfall released…"; "She knelt, withdrew…set it gently…"; "She stayed…then walked…lighter by the exact weight…". Paraphrase loop: the final paragraph restates "I am here" three times with minor variation. Baseline artifact penalty (−0.8) applied for density and template runs across high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, character action, escalation). Rhythm varies and accelerates into the climax. Minor loop: "the charts showed a convergence" / "the charts indicated" / "astronomical charts promised" recurs across beats with slight synonym variation. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She [verb], [verb]-ing" structures cluster ("She wheeled… yanking," "She answered, feeding," "She killed, flipped"). Figurative density is high throughout ("velvet migraine," "ghost brawl riding the same air") without always earning the lyricism under accumulative pressure. These issues do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly. No paraphrase loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance multiple jobs (e.g., "compass point quivered like a dowsing rod, sensing invisible angles" = object, character skill, foreshadowing). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the mutiny sequence. Two minor loop artifacts: "she was a claustrophobic explorer" followed immediately by training detail reads expository; "notes sliding...like slow rain" / "each chord a long footstep circling her" stacks metaphors without full coherence (rain doesn't circle). Opening and closing lines anchor well. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Figurative density is high but mostly earned by the "spatial mutiny" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"lance…of surgery," "empathy convulsed awake," "shadows rearranging into something like shoulders"—and several metaphors (mist as guilt, ribbon as warning flag, quarry exhaling) recur without always tightening pressure. The phrase "furrowed hush of the quarry deepened, as though the cliffs leaned closer to watch" exemplifies poetic overwriting that slows a pivotal beat. Minimal paraphrase loops, but the stacked metaphors in the climax (blood, weave, convulsion, paddles) risk mixed vehicles and register drift. No major causality breaks, so deductions remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence-level rhythm is mostly controlled, but several beats rely on template cadence and paraphrase loops. The opening sentence runs long with multiple subordinate clauses that delay the anchor. Across the middle section, lines like "she sang coded lullabies…the rhythm helping her spot stanzas" and "the journals' author…had written in salt-cipher to hide from mutineers" stack exposition without propulsion. The phrase "nervously confident" appears twice in identical construction (opening and later "nervously confident and soaked in secrets"), a small loop. Figurative density is high throughout ("spongey plankwalk," "copper nail pulsed," "gravitational pull of legacy," "sky's spongey dread glowed the color of old pennies") without consistent payoff; some metaphors feel ornamental rather than pressure-driven. The final paragraphs compress weeks into summary, losing concrete action. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags in exposition-heavy stretches. Deductions: template cadence and paraphrase loops −0.6, figurative density without pattern-teaching −0.4, summary in place of scene in final third −0.3, total −1.3 within Q7. Starting from functional baseline ~7.4, final score 6.1.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching that pays off at closure: "bled across the valley," "ghost limb of possibility," "fermata held until breath became suspect," "wireframe waiting for skin." Mixed metaphors cluster (pixels, emulsion, scaffold wrap, bones-to-clay, fence charged with storm) and compete rather than cohere. Template cadence appears in stacked "she [verb]" stems across the middle third. Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs (image + mood) but momentum stalls when metaphor piles without advancing causality. Paraphrase loops appear ("stepped backward—or forward" restates ambiguity without added pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; no runs of identical stems. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (setting + interiority, object + theme). Two frictions lower the score: (1) "dusky harmony" and "polished calm" appear three times each, risking lyric overreliance without escalating pressure; (2) "territorial markers" is used in three contexts (bills, fire, memory) where the metaphor stretches thin and borders on synonym churn. The final paragraph compresses cleanly ("unopened roads," "fewer by one but finally in circulation"), and no paraphrase loops obscure causality. Propulsion remains steady, but figurative density in the middle third ("looping road," "retelling," "reroutes like bad GPS") nudges toward overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "telegram's faded petals whispered," "bruise-shaped syllable," "pigments could drink ancient light," "hairline cracks in the metal sealed, healing the instrument with words older than iron." Many adjacent sentences restate the same content ("the inscriptions resisted healing; they throbbed with grief" followed by "She spoke aloud the petal-syllables, and the temple answered"). Template cadence appears in several runs: "She placed…and the flower's…where it touched…" The final paragraph stacks summary declarations ("the stars above kept perfect records," "stories inside her settle," "words that would ride electromagnetic winds") without propulsion. Paraphrase loops and stock metaphor strings ("daylilies bloomed forever between pages of starlight, midnight solace pressed into every petal") dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "she spoke only to things that could not answer" establishes isolation, druidic practice, and defensive stance in one). Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings avoid template cadence. Two issues prevent higher band: (1) minor paraphrase loop in the opening third—"the magic trick failed" is restated across two sentences without added pressure; (2) one metaphor verges on mixed ("confession wrapped in frost and hidden from every polished surface" shifts vehicle from ice to mirror without clear bridge). Propulsion remains strong, and no artifacts touch the closure beat. Figurative density is high but coherent, avoiding the overwriting penalty by maintaining concrete anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("sky itself had bruised and bled into the grass," "roots writhing like compass needles," "kite string humming before it snaps"), creating a lyric texture that supports the accumulative lens. However, metaphor vehicles occasionally clash: "maze topiary clipping" has "roots writhing like compass needles" but is carried in a shirt pocket with "tiny leaves still warm"—spatial and scale logic wobbles. Paraphrase loops appear: "the future had arrived early" / "the early future slowed" restate without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraph openings use similar constructions ("I stepped," "I carried," "I followed," "I let"). Information density is high, but some lines over-explain: "anxious elation, that trembling midpoint between discovery and disaster" defines what the phrase already conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: most lines layer image, character, and world-building. Rhythm modulates purposefully (long accumulative passages, then short crisis beats: "I nodded"). No paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor deduction: "fiercely gentle" recurs as descriptor without evolving into embodied contradiction in peak beats, and "dusky resolve" appears three times as label rather than enacted texture. Template stems avoided; read-aloud ear strong.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmically varied through most beats, with strong concrete anchors (diesel smell, dented reel-to-reel, copper wire, +52 volts). However, the opening paragraph stacks metaphors without breathing room ("last chord... would not fade," "glitter that had followed him," "amps went silent"), and the final two paragraphs loop thematic restatements ("no longer a souvenir but a membrane," "wrest beauty," "echo valley longing find its place in the mix") that paraphrase rather than advance. The phrase "confidently uncertain" and "echo valley longing" feel like prompt echoes inserted without organic integration. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph ("to wrest... to let... to keep") and filter-verb reliance ("felt the vacuum," "felt like reconciliation") dull immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high and rhythm modulates well through accumulative beats. However, several lines loop conceptually: "the gentle momentum of meaning itself" echoes "the physics of transition," and "touching distance…fingertip and memory" paraphrases the earlier bridging imagery without added pressure. The equation sequence ("love over time is velocity, and velocity over distance is home") stacks abstractions in adjacent sentences, creating mild density drag. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the conceptual redundancy in the middle third triggers a −0.4 deduction in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is often overwritten with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence, creating momentum drag. Mixed metaphors appear: "tomorrow dissolve into foam," "the moon tugged at the edges of her own name," "colors smeared sideways, a migrating identity of its own." Paraphrase loops recur (e.g., the creel's function is restated multiple times across beats without added pressure). Template cadence: "She cranked… She stepped… She spoke… She wound… She felt… She planted… She lifted… She sat… She whispered… She closed… She recorded… She stood." Register drift into abstract philosophizing ("memory kept by machines is only storage") clashes with the established voice. Heavy density obscures rather than propels; artifacts touch the closure beat ("She stood, gears humming a lullaby older than rust").

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile—without pattern-teaching or pressure modulation; high-density description in beats that call for action (kneeling, placing crown) slows momentum. Mixed metaphors appear: "cave hummed like a throat" works, but "door ajar by rusted longing" conflates physics and emotion without grounding the mechanism. Several paraphrase loops: "collective weight" / "shared ache" restate without new detail. Template cadence runs in the middle third (repeated "she + past-tense verb" openings). Sentence rhythm is controlled, but information density suffers when ornament substitutes for causal linkage; apply −0.8 for spread across these patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, symbol, or momentum. Clarity is maintained across spatial moves. However, patterned overwriting appears throughout: stacked metaphors in peak beats ("river inside her mind rushed clearer," "accordion's wheeze mirrored her own faltering lungs," "tears diluted the lithium residue"), template-cadence runs ("She walked, counting paces... daringly methodical... until the tunnel opened"), and synonym loops ("chronicler," "chronicle" recycled without reweighting). The phrase "daringly methodical" appears three times with minor variation. Filter-verb clusters ("heard," "feeling," "saw") dull immediacy in the tunnel descent. Apply −0.8 for overwriting density and template cadence across multiple beats; −0.3 for paraphrase loops on "daringly methodical."

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "Between two fateful letters" repeated, "propagation delays" recycled without added pressure, "unspoken words" and "library" churn through synonym variants. Template cadence in the middle third: "The [noun] [verbed]" runs for five sentences. Stock metaphors ("feeding on words," "breathing") and elevated diction ("cautious exuberance," "pure articulation") in peak beats create register drift. The closure beat is clouded by figurative language ("dissolved into pure articulation," "newest wing") that abstracts rather than concretizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose demonstrates high figurative density and rhythmic ambition, but several beats suffer from overwriting that obscures rather than sharpens meaning. "The domed ceiling a bruised purple that made every footstep feel like trespass" stacks metaphors without clear vehicle logic. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the same content with synonym variation: the violin "wanted to return home" / "whispered that home was here" / glaciers "remember" all gesture at the same idea. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph's repeated "she had" constructions. The closure beat itself remains relatively clean, preventing deeper penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence ("constellations," "maps across cooling flesh," "needle pulling night") that occasionally contradict physical logic (starlight dripping from crystal stalactites). Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "the widow who died…the child who clutched…the poet whose last heartbeat" creates a list-like rhythm that flattens momentum. Paraphrase loops are present: "she needed that spark before oblivion swallowed it, the same way oblivion had swallowed…" restates without advancing pressure. The overwriting persists into the closure beat, where "particles of radiant hush drifting upward to seed new constellations" obscures the protagonist's final state rather than clarifying the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is extreme, with nearly every sentence carrying metaphor or elevated diction ("cloud-rooted limb," "scallop inward," "moth-dust," "vineyard hush"). This creates textural richness but also overwriting—lines like "her knees scallop inward, the joints folding as if to cradle an infant" pile vehicles without clear propulsion. The word "scallop" recurs as verb, noun, and modifier across seven distinct usages, creating pattern but also synonym churn. Template cadence appears in the opening third: "She carried nothing except... She listened for... A spiral of shadow peeled..." Paraphrase loops occur when the grotto's "law" is stated twice in adjacent beats. No major clarity breaks, but density slows momentum in peak moments (the hairpin fusion, the boy's transformations) where concrete action would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high across most sentences: "moral radiation," "coat you've outgrown," "flapping like a loose sail." Mixed-vehicle risk appears in "cloak of doubt...wasn't fabric but atmosphere, a protective vulnerability...felt threadbare," where the garment metaphor blurs. Paraphrase loop: "sincerely insincere" and "mouths forming confident words while their eyes begged" restate the same contradiction within two sentences. Template stem runs in the wind-chime catalog slightly flatten momentum. Information density is strong in setup beats; closure image propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.0)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("magnetic grotto's hum," "starlight filtering through leaves"). Yet template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "vanishing to appear" / "appearing and vanishing are the same motion" / "vanishing was simply another way of appearing" cycles the core idea without added pressure. The line "watched the last ring disappear, understanding finally why she'd withheld the truth—because knowing you would vanish was different from understanding that vanishing was simply another way of appearing" is a scaffold explanation rather than propulsive closure. Stock metaphor ("quantum foam from which all things emerge") and elevated register in peak beats ("waveform of possibility") drift from the POV's immediate embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "the harmonic stone skimmer" appears as a subject in nine sentences, "bone towers" in seven, "flock of birds" in four, creating a drumbeat that flattens rhythm. Synonym churn ("weathered palm," "weathered resolve," "weathered face") and stacked metaphors ("canyon of endless echoes," "throat of endless echoes," "pulse left wandering") recycle the same mystical register without advancing sense. Mixed metaphors abound: the canyon is simultaneously a throat, a vortex, and a singer, while the pulse is both wandering and anchored. The final third consists almost entirely of summary assertions ("he understood," "he knew," "he had become") rather than concrete action or image, violating the show-versus-tell contract at the story's most critical moment. High-band penalties: template cadence and paraphrase loops in closure zone trigger −1.7 adjustment and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"algorithmic auroras," "ribbon of warm light," "filament of unmeasured joy"—and while most land cleanly, the sheer volume risks overwriting in a ~1,600-word piece. Two paraphrase loops: "breath a garden folly of warmth" restates prior metaphor without added pressure; "darkness felt exactly bright enough" echoes "brilliant dimness" without deepening it. Sentence variety is strong, information density high, no template cadence detected. The loop and density issues pull the score below 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high in nearly every sentence ("meteor hush," "copper echo," "paper lanterns…hiding behind truth," "velvet," "star-smoke," "comet tail"), creating a pattern-taught lyric mode. However, mixed vehicles appear: "hiding behind truth the way old letters hide between pages" conflates concealment with storage, and "the click that tasted of green" blurs synesthesia into free association. Template cadence runs in the underwater sequence ("Jin's boots found…he breathed…he opened…he wandered…he reached…Jin set…Jin sealed…Jin rose"). Paraphrase loops: "discover the color of sound" recurs without escalation across paragraphs. Apply −0.8 for density without coherence and template stems; artifacts do not touch the closure image directly but pervade the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is extreme and sustained without pattern-teaching or payoff: "starlight fossilized into golden panes," "stellar doubt gnawing her ribs," "backwards prophecy ripening toward revelation." Mixed metaphors proliferate: coins "grow warm" then "jealous of transcendence," the spiral both architectural and emotional. Template cadence appears in repeated participial openers and "she [verb]" stems across the middle third. Paraphrase loops: "understanding static bursts" is restated three times without added pressure. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("superposed, a quantum beacon"), triggering the disallow-9+ cap globally and −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout (sea monsters, silver lice, spider's silk, chapel bells, tiny phonographs) with mixed coherence: "constellations crawled across the dome like silver lice" jars tonally, and "dusk pouring in as liquid copper" contradicts earlier quartz-dust grounding. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("The reaper traced… The reaper tried… The reaper stepped"). Paraphrase loops: "he had never considered himself worthy of sacrifice, only of endings" restates the opening arc without adding pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (atlas boat sailing and cutting star-sentences) but decorative lyricism occasionally stalls momentum. No major causality breaks; artifacts lower the score but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("a dolphin, its skin stitched from rust and regret"), but several paraphrase loops appear: "The ocean didn't vanish. The children… kept counting. They taught their children to count" restates the same content across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence in the children's offerings paragraph ("shells… lures… tears") stacks without on-page consequence. The closure paragraph avoids these patterns and lands cleanly, limiting deduction to −0.6 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied ("metallic sigh," "slicing through twilight," "scrap carrying the weight of private grief"). Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, memory, or choice. Two slips lower the score: "Behind the bar rested a single intact bottle, label facing outward as if waiting" leans into convenient staging, and the phrase "building a new trail that would lead tomorrow's visitors not to forgotten scandal but to shared memory: a museum of common loss and common survival" stacks abstraction ("common loss," "common survival") where a concrete image would sharpen. No loops or major artifacts, but a slight scaffold quality in the explanatory clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery (starlings like liquid iron, flame painting embered halos, orchard skin peeling back). However, figurative density is high in nearly every sentence, creating a sustained ornate texture that obscures causal linkage at key moments—"the crystal melted into a single drop that refused to fall; it hovered, swelling, until it held the entire orchard upside down inside itself" is gorgeous but abstracts the physical action. Paraphrase loops appear: "Logic offered its last equation...Intuition answered with a single image" repeats the logic/intuition binary just established. Template cadence in the vision sequence ("the first seed...the first blossom...the first fruit") and the final paragraph's list ("every flame, every flock, every hidden orchard") add −0.6. Minor filter-verb stacks ("feeling," "saw," "felt") do not dull immediacy but cluster in high-pressure beats. Information density is high, but momentum sags under decorative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance ritual, choice, or motif. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates (short beats at the signal exchange, longer reflection during descent). Three friction clusters lower the score: (1) paraphrase loops—"trust under pressure" appears verbatim twice; "soundless echo" recurs four times with diminishing return; "muscle memory" is restated in adjacent lines. (2) Template cadence in the middle third: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences during the descent without taught pattern. (3) Stock metaphor: "dawn bruised the horizon" and "burden settle across her shoulders like the harness" are competent but familiar. Loops and cadence issues spread across non-closure beats, capping high-band entry. Clarity and propulsion remain intact; no causality obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is often striking ("brain floated like a pale jellyfish," "motes that sank into their skin"). Clarity holds through complex choreography. However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt something stir," "saw the tremor," "understood"), dulling immediacy. Several lines loop conceptually: "slicing through pretense" appears three times; "history rewrites itself" recurs without evolving meaning. Minor scaffold weakens density in the final third, and some metaphors reach ("feeding on the symmetry of their wounds") without grounding in physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high: "He understood then that tending to the unspoken does not mean bringing the dead back; it means giving absence a shape echoing can carry" does triple work (realization, thematic hinge, tactic shift). Figurative language is vivid but occasionally stacks: "memory...could be tended, coaxed, maybe even restored," "heart macerated itself against his ribs, hope shredding muscle," and "laughter...like a rubber ball made of light" cluster within two paragraphs, risking density overload. "Mournfully eager" appears twice with identical phrasing (handle in graf 4, engine in final graf)—a minor loop. No causality breaks or major opacity; the closure beat remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (frost-as-text motif sustained), but several beats stack metaphors without clear propulsion: "a labyrinth whose walls were made of foggy lucidity, that state where shapes almost declare themselves" layers abstraction on abstraction. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines—"She did not cross" followed by "Instead she placed the pendant" restates the same refusal. Template cadence is avoided, and sentence rhythm varies purposefully, but information density sags in the middle third where waiting is re-described without advancing situation. The final paragraph risks summary ("carrying neither pendant nor answer, only the expanded boundary") but recovers with the concrete image of uncertainty's footfalls. No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative filter-verb reliance ("she thought," "she remembered," "she had come to befriend") dulls immediacy in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("frozen bloom," "lattice," "penny-drops rhythm"). However, nearly every sentence in peak beats carries metaphor or elevated diction, creating texture-saturation that slows momentum rather than propelling it. Paraphrase loops appear: "stoically sensitive" repeats three times; "cold bloom" / "frozen bloom" / "bloom...arrested mid-burst" cycle without added meaning. The phrase "successive approximation" appears intact in narration and story-internal thought, feeling like a transplanted prompt term rather than organically motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense throughout, but overwriting pervades peak beats: metaphors stack without breathing room ("chandeliers," "slow-motion waltzes," "bloated moon" in one paragraph), creating texture for its own sake rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("silence is absence" restated across multiple beats; "every ending" recurs four times in the final third). Template cadence is visible in repeated "she [verb]" openings across seven paragraphs. Filter verbs ("she heard," "she realized," "she understood") cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. The closure beat is touched by ornamental phrasing ("mercury," "language older than silence") that obscures rather than charges the final image. No clear causality break, but momentum drags under the weight of decorative detail.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but figurative density is high across most beats—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile (moon dripping, barnacles spelling coordinates, hourglass filling with constellation, frost that chose to stay). In the grotto climax, "stalactites knitting together like fingers after prayer" and "starlight thinned to a wire" stack within two lines, slightly dulling immediacy. Paraphrase loop: "the ferry felt entire, a single arrow pointing toward one coherent tomorrow" followed by "the grotto was gone; only open water and a horizon that kept its promises remained" restates closure satisfaction without advancing image. No scaffold or template cadence; information density is high. Clarity remains intact, but the cumulative figurative load in peak beats triggers a −0.4 penalty under the Overwriting Check (density test). Propulsion is steady; no loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.9)
    Persistent template cadence: seven sentences begin with "The" in quick succession (lines 4, 8, 14, 17, 18, 22, 27), and runs of "She [verb]" / "Her [noun]" (lines 2, 6, 7, 16, 21, 28) create monotonous rhythm (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "as memories alter the shape of a life lived backward" (line 7) and "as memories alter the chemistry of dreaming" (line 17) restate the same metaphor without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("dandelion seeds," "hurricane made of human connection") and filter-verb stacks ("She realized," "she understood," "She understood now") in lines 18, 20, 26, 28 dull immediacy (−0.5). Information density is low; many lines restate the weaving concept without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm is varied and propulsive in key beats: "She lifted the chain link, letting it spin like a slow planet." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, template cadence appears in several passages: "She almost lied, but…" / "She closed her eyes, feeling…" / "She placed the chain link in his palm, closing his fingers…" clusters pronoun + verb stems. Paraphrase loop: "the city seemed darker, as if possibility itself had been towed away" closely echoes the prior leviathan description without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "horizons could unfold in directions no compass had ever measured" reads generic rather than specific to edge geometry. These artifacts total −0.8 under the patterned-artifact pack (template cadence, paraphrase loop, stock metaphor); none touch the closure beat directly, so the deduction remains in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the archive break-in and slowing for the final dawn image. Minor overwriting clusters in figurative language: "swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light," "vines had learned to mimic heart valves," "reeling hush" all compress into early paragraphs without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("Tell him," "Show them," "Keep it"). No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, but the density of metaphor occasionally competes with propulsion in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose carries strong figurative density: "throat of stone that pulsed," "speed of regret," "luminous lacquer." Information density is high—most lines advance both atmosphere and plot. However, several beats edge into overwriting: "the crashing hush replaced by the ordinary roar of water against rock" stacks two metaphors where one would land harder. Paraphrase loop appears: paragraphs describing each technician (Sato, Patel, Oka) follow near-identical structure without taught pattern. Sentence openings vary well. The final paragraph's "copper strand in the long cable between past and tomorrow" feels slightly ornamental rather than adding pressure. No major opacity, but the density occasionally slows momentum in the middle descent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but purposeful in most beats: "Snow taps the copper roof in Morse: stay, stay, stay" and "the sky is a dark page waiting for ink" integrate image with situation. Information density is high. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs accumulate: "I think of the wisdom I came for: not how to remain living, but how to live with..." restates the central question without added pressure; "I tell her the map I drank, the corridor I walked, the count I keep. / I tell her failure is a telescope" cycles through parallel stems. The phrase "each beat is a reminder" / "each step a defragmented fragment" / "each breath a syllable" recurs across the piece as a syntactic tic. Minor filter-verb stack in the hospital-flashback paragraph ("felt me as flickering monitors, as phantom pagers, as the soft tug"). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the ink-ritual causality or final image. Deduction: −0.8 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter stack = −1.1 total, landing mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "towers of bone hum their thousand-year lament," "pulse into meter, skin into drum," "corduroy riverbed, knapped-flint sorrow, nubby reed-mat of childbirth." In peak beats (swallowing the diamond, calcification sequence), metaphor stacks without respite—"cold brilliance slid down her copper-veined throat, and every vein lit like a filament, projecting texture-sounds"—which risks overwriting per Q7 guidelines (−0.5 for density without pattern-taught payoff in high-pressure moments). Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 12–13 both describe calcification and phoneme release with near-synonym texture. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density is high, but the relentless lyricism dulls propulsion at closure. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative saturation in peak beats, −0.2 for paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft shows vivid figurative language but suffers from density overload and coherence strain. Nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats deploys metaphor or elevated diction ("velvet scales that shimmered ultraviolet, gravitationally playful, pulling her knees toward the ceiling though she remained upside-down"), obscuring spatial clarity and slowing momentum (−0.6 for density in peak beats). Mixed metaphors undermine coherence: "gravitationally playful" recurs as both fireflies and scales without consistent vehicle logic (−0.4). Template cadence appears in repeated "she [verb]" openers across adjacent paragraphs (−0.3). Paraphrase loops ("the missing had never been lost; they had simply rehearsed the joke") restate without advancing pressure (−0.2). Information density is high but often decorative rather than propulsive; the final third could shed 20% without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or poetic construction—creating a lush texture that occasionally muddles causality (e.g., "childhood fairy tales left out in the rain to rust" as atmospheric filler). Paraphrase loops appear: "beauty, once reawakened, travels on its own legs, even if those legs are only remembered wings" restates the orchard's independence without new pressure. Template cadence runs ("One guardian paused… and in that hesitation Calla advanced… She played… Apricot blossoms drifted…") flatten propulsion. The closure paragraph stacks abstraction ("gap between knowing and understanding," "fruit tasting faintly of escape") where concrete image would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density is high but coherent within the accumulative design. Information density is strong—most lines advance image, constraint, or theme—but scaffolding appears: "Every absence he had ever fostered… pressed against his ribs" is abstract setup for the console beat; "the day's lone mail drop had finally delivered him to the place where broken promises heal" is a thematic restatement that recaps rather than propels. Template cadence appears in the final third: "He walked back… He delivered no… And when the next twilight…" uses identical stems across three sequential moves. Mixed metaphor: "neon veins flickering like dying stars" conflates organic and astronomical vehicles without bridging logic. Paraphrase loop: "the place where broken promises heal: not forward or backward, but inside the hush between sending and receiving" restates the theme concept twice in adjacent clauses. Proofreading is clean; no grammar errors. Propulsion is steady but slows in the summary-mode final paragraph. Artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure image, so deductions remain within Q7 and do not cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose density is high and figurative language is purposeful in most beats, but several lines exhibit overwriting: "the chime of wind bells, time itself seemed to pause, each metallic note a soft punctuation in the breath between seconds" stacks metaphors without clear payoff, and "a whispering gleam that could teach the mute to sing and the deaf to dream in color" mixes registers. Paraphrase loops appear ("the halo fragment dissolved into the final chord, a whispering gleam that sank into his chest, not as power but as promise" and the prior sentence both restate the fragment's internalization). Filter-verb stacks ("he heard them breathe") and template cadence in the final third ("He walked back… He kept walking… He did not look back") dull momentum. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: −0.6 for template cadence and filter stacks, −0.3 for figurative muddle in peak beats, total −0.9 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative density is high throughout, often stacking metaphors within single sentences: "narratives that refused linear time," "pure topology," "Möbius strips of cause and effect," "narrative gravity," "strange attractor of inspiration." Many phrases loop conceptually without advancing action—"stories existed as pure topology" is restated as "topological fabric" and "hyperbolic folds between experience and expression." Template cadence appears in the mid-section: "She understood…She realized…She saw…She understood" across four paragraphs. Paraphrase loops touch the closure beat: "stories lived everywhere and nowhere" echoes "lived in the relationships between places" without added pressure. The final paragraph recycles "adjusted her tattered silk scarf" from the opening, and "stories that would eventually find their authors" repeats the throughline without new cost. Combined artifacts (density, loops, closure-zone repetition) trigger −1.2 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and many images are striking ("horizon here was movable, a shy animal"), but density problems accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "each step releasing a hush that sounded like her own pulse trying to pronounce someone's hidden name" restates the whispering motif already established. Template cadence runs through the middle: "she lifted…touched…began painting" / "she clicked…again and again" / "she stepped…raised…painted…coaxing" stack identical structures. Figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or clear payoff (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "tide tongues licked basalt runes" and "contrails of color…like neon seaweed" layer incompatible vehicles. Several nominalizations ("vitalize," "coherent longing") and passive constructions ("was transferred") slow momentum. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.5, figurative density −0.5, totaling roughly −1.2 before band adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching a payoff; metaphors stack ("velvet pouch," "hush of cosmic possibility," "flavor of regret," "sympathetic code," "improbable longing") in ways that blur rather than sharpen the moment. Mixed vehicles appear: ribbon "threads itself" (mechanical) yet "stiffens" (organic), and the cub becomes "torrent of black ink" that "pours" yet also fills her with "words she had swallowed"—liquid, solid, and abstract simultaneously. Template cadence runs cluster in the final third ("She walked… She spoke… She lifted…"), and paraphrase loops recur (e.g., "improbable longing" appears five times). Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the Q7 cap and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact-penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; most lines advance setting, memory recovery, or motif. Rhythm varies appropriately. Two paraphrase loops appear: "the same pale green as the night she forgot" echoed by "the night the Pleiades returned, the night she learned"; "chronically curious" repeats without added pressure. Template cadence in the memory-return sequence ("the taste of pear butter… the Gaelic lullaby… her mother's laugh") reads list-like. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "accordion's last chord" works, though "chandeliers of wet rope" strains slightly. −0.6 for loops and template stems, modest accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully; opening and closing images are vivid. Some figurative density ("hush felt like an empty playground swing," "shelves shifting like ribs breathing") approaches overwriting in adjacent beats but remains legible. Minor paraphrase loop: "walked backwards" recurs across five beats without changing cost or texture each time; baseline −0.2 applied. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Information density is high; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative density is high throughout—"threads of liquid light weaving between worlds," "moss became emerald flame, stone sang bass notes of violet"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, edging toward purple in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loop: "the loom was not a cage but a shuttle" closely echoes "to preserve the color of wonder he must let it travel, not hoard it." Syntax varies and propulsion is mostly clean.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences ("Each mask he touched carried an interlaced hush, a silence so complete it accumulated in his lungs like water") alternating with shorter beats at key turns. Information density is generally high, but some lines loop conceptually: "accumulated silence" appears multiple times without fresh inflection, and "interlaced hush" / "silence pooled" / "accumulated silence lifted" feel like synonym churn on the same motif. Metaphor density in peak beats (net unraveling, spirit materializing) occasionally stacks without full coherence—"waves retreating from shore" voice, "phosphorescence," "man-shaped absence" cluster without clear linkage. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the repeated "broken mask restorer" epithet across multiple paragraphs becomes scaffolding. Overall clarity remains intact, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high across beats. However, some lines carry overwriting: "the omission here was a scream wearing silence," "warm smoke," "mineral hush," and "one disciplined beam of stormlight" cluster elevated metaphors without breathing room. Minor paraphrase loop: the chapel opening is restated across multiple sentences ("did not open by force; it reopened when someone outside had grown quiet"). Propulsion remains strong, but the figurative load in peak beats approaches ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high—nearly every sentence in the opening third deploys metaphor or simile ("wings iced with static," "unread telegrams," "spectral ionosphere")—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that constrains later choice, triggering overwriting concerns. Mixed metaphors appear: "history uncurls its fingers" while "the object continues downward alone" mixes agency with passive drift. Template cadence runs occur: "the snow globe [X], the miniature Electra [Y]" recurs across beats. Some lines do double duty well ("exhaled a silver balloon of breath" physicality + release metaphor), but paraphrase loops appear: "quietly analytic reminder" rephrases the magnesium-as-telegram image without new pressure. Propulsion is uneven; the notebook-dissolving beat adds no new choice after the recognition of 1914. Artifact concentration in the final third disallows 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is extreme and often incoherent: "static that lived between lightning and thunder," "sky's white quill," "lightning-slag stylus," "bruised chromas" pile metaphor on metaphor without clear vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops appear: "ghost in code" is defined three times across paragraphs without adding detail. Template cadence: "She painted faster…She set…She shouldered…She descended…She kept walking" runs through the final third. Mixed metaphor: "driftingly alert" modifies states (vapor, echo, courtyard) that cannot share the same alertness. These artifacts dull the closure image and obscure causality (−1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across the piece. Information density is high—nearly every line advances discovery or deepens atmosphere. Minor template cadence appears in the "On floor X" parallel structure (floors five and two), though it serves a clear mosaic function and remains brief. One paraphrase near the end: "affectionately detached from the grief that had brought her here, yet tethered to the joy now germinating" restates the core tension without new pressure, costing ~0.2. Figurative language ("joy disguised as ornament, anguish dressed in confetti") is dense but coherent and voice-consistent. No loops or scaffolding that obscure causality; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high. Significant issues: paraphrase loops appear ("The gondola creaked" / "The gondola dropped a meter, spinning slowly"), and several beats lean on template cadence ("Tell them..." anaphora, while effective, borders on scaffold). Stock metaphors recur ("miniature galaxies," "match heads struck"). The phrase "quietly explosive" appears twice in similar constructions, and "spooled wholeness" is repeated without reweighting. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.8 for loops, template stems, and stock images; the closure image is vivid but not immune to the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; sentences layer setting, action, and interiority effectively. Rhythm varies and propulsion is maintained through the countdown. However, template cadence appears in several beats: "She understands now…" / "She knows suddenly…" / "She realizes…" creates a repetitive revelation pattern. Paraphrase loop: "the sky she has never seen clearly" and "her vision always fragmented" restate the same idea within one paragraph. Mixed metaphor: "sky-shaped absence that holds them together" strains coherence when absence is given weight and agency. Filter-verb stack in reflective passages ("understands," "knows," "realizes") dulls immediacy during high-pressure beats. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce line-level tightness, triggering a −0.8 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; no algorithmic patterns. Sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in many lines ("She carried no compass tonight; instead she clutched a polyglot's phrasebook dog-ear..."). The hopscotch-board discovery is vivid and propulsive. Minor loop: "stranded luminance" appears twice—once as description, once as internal metaphor—without reweighting; the second use feels like synonym churn. The phrase "sociable isolation" is stated outright rather than left implicit. A few stock constructions slip through: "knees shook," "heart faltering," "spilled ink." Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "light-feed runs on stories, not coal" is a late metaphor that borders on convenient. No major scaffold or paraphrase loops. Clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout, especially in peak beats: "breath unfurled as silver gauze," "frost racing along the shank," "driftwood nostalgia," "overlapping ticks a distant morning soft as hush." Multiple adjacent sentences carry metaphor without clear payoff, violating the overwriting density check (−0.5). Template cadence appears in several runs: "He uncapped… letting… so he held… listening…" and "Rowan stepped… Rowan set… opened… started adjusting…" (−0.4). Mixed vehicle: "mirrors… repeated it in fractal chorus" conflates visual and auditory modes without coherent mapping (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, and information density is generally high. Total artifact penalty ~−1.2, pushing the score below 7.0 and disqualifying 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"nebula of respite," "brambled hope," "gravity-defying apple trees," "butterfly-wing dust"—and while many images are vivid, the accumulation occasionally stalls momentum (e.g., "its tone brambled hope, a clang like berries caught in wire—beautiful because it hurt" over-explicates). Paraphrase loops appear: "her altruistic spirit" echoes "altruistic pulse" within two paragraphs; "share breath, share weight, share sky" then "shared anesthesia" then "shared life" cycles synonym variations. Information density is strong in the harvest sequence (human ropes, grandmothers anchoring, toddlers passing fruit), but the opening three paragraphs front-load world detail without immediate pressure. No major grammar or sequencing errors; pronoun references remain clear. The final paragraph's shift to summary voice ("Years later…") compresses time efficiently but loses the embodied texture of earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is vivid ("pane of night so matte it drank the orange afterglow," "raindrop at the lighthouse window, dusk caught inside it"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or stakes. However, several beats approach overwriting: "veins of mercury pumping beneath numerals that bled" and "silence so complete it circled around to music on the far side of hearing" pile metaphor without clarifying mechanism. The phrase "bruised awe" recurs but feels more like a label than an embodied state. Minor deduction for elevated diction density in middle paragraphs that risks slowing momentum, though the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; no major loops or scaffold. Figurative language is vivid ("white nooses," "lullaby of grinding teeth") but occasionally overwritten in non-peak beats ("candle left too close to the edge" stretches the vehicle). Minor template cadence in the middle third (repeated "She + verb" openers across four lines). The closing image is strong and propulsive. Clarity is maintained throughout; no causality breaks. Deduct −0.4 for density cluster and stem repetition that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the lab and ravine beats. However, figurative language saturates many sentences without pattern-teaching payoff—"grief itself had pupated," "loosened grief slipping down," "fossilized moonlight," "moonlight loosens its grip"—reducing propulsion in peak moments. Template cadence appears in the camper sequence: "a canon that rose," "laughter, a recipe, a bark," "palms pressed to glowing shells, eyes closing." The closing paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("proof that polymers of memory can be rewoven into bridges stronger than the original loss") tells what the image already showed, flattening the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language pervades most sentences ("incise the day," "hours bleed out," "fruit chimed," "scent of rain on hot pavement that had never existed"), creating a sustained lyric texture that teaches a pattern but risks overwriting in high-pressure beats where clarity would serve better. Mixed metaphors appear: the sea of clouds "cracked into spiral notebooks of storm" mixes geological rupture with stationery in a vehicle that strains coherence. Several paraphrase loops: "she set her folding table beneath them, aligning the legs with cracks" and "On the table she arranged seven bottles" restate setup without added pressure; "Customers were scarce; the library's opening-day lull felt like a held note" doubles the same observation. Template cadence in transaction beats: "He set... The vendor nodded, bottled... and handed..." and "She opened... releasing... projecting..." show repetitive action chains. Information density is high, but scaffolding phrases like "because only by quantifying absence could she" and "so she uncorked" appear across multiple beats without propelling new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("each droplet carrying the salt of a hundred forgotten storms") but occasionally stacks without clear propulsion ("sand turned to glass by centuries of sun, now fractured into tidal pool formations"). Paraphrase loops appear: "to taste memories through touch, to subsume the emotional residue" restates the same idea, and "the sound of sorrow that had learned to make room for new growth" near the end echoes prior phrasing. Template cadence emerges in the courtyard paragraph ("each depression held...each ridge a moment"). Clarity remains high and no artifacts obscure the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Density is high, but figurative language saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching or payoff, especially in peak beats: "cradling a fallen cuckoo clock weight like a cold heart," "wooden throat sang a bass note," "iris to the cosmos." Mixed metaphors abound—"construct bridges from silos" conceptually conflicts with the physical tower/elevator setup (−0.6). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She descended… She opened… She spoke… She climbed…" (−0.5). Register drift into abstract academic phrasing ("dissolving the barriers between human need and mechanical memory") clashes with the narrative voice in high-pressure beats (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "empathetically decisive" is restated as "felt the tower's wheeze and the elevator's hunger as clearly as off-key chords" without added pressure (−0.2). Cumulative artifacts total −1.7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is extreme and sustained throughout high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching that pays off at closure: "chasm breathed cold light," "periscope mirror abandoned by some giant," "synaptic plasticity gone feral," "engines mid-birth clattered to dust." Mixed metaphors appear ("cold fire," "mercury seeking its old shape," "turbines bud in her marrow") that dilute clarity. Several lines loop or paraphrase: "chaotically precise" recurs identically three times, and the final paragraph restates "transformation" and "archaeology" without added pressure. Template cadence in the dream-sequence section ("a boy wanting… a woman sketching… a man humming") and stacked present participles flatten rhythm. Applying artifact penalties: density without payoff −0.6, mixed metaphor −0.4, paraphrase loop −0.2, total deduction ~−1.2 from a baseline mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong sensory detail ("iron-gall ink," "quartz dust," "ultraviolet veins"). However, several passages exhibit overwriting: "each droplet a tiny lantern," "slip between," "drift-walked along the ceiling-tunnel" stack figurative language densely without breathing room. Template cadence appears in multiple "she [verb]" sequences without variation. The phrase "clandestinely luminous" recurs four times, twice as decorative label rather than functional description. Minor loops: "the grotto" opens three consecutive paragraphs in the middle section. These patterns don't obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift, and information density is high ("Each crack records torque of stormwind, weight of snow, final sigh of root"). Clarity and momentum are strong. However, figurative density in nearly every line—"glass nests," "arboreal time," "conversation—tree to bird to soil to her own blood"—risks overwriting without consistent pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphor: "ivy" climbing cracks is spatial, "arpeggio" is sonic; the blend works but borders on decorative. Minimal loops; no scaffold detected. The final third maintains propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "silence" is restated across adjacent paragraphs without new pressure (lines 4, 5, 9, 15); "beauty in difficulty" recurs in lines 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 20 as synonym churn. Template cadence appears in stacked "he had" constructions (lines 6, 10, 19). Figurative density is high ("crystalline beauty," "invisible geometries," "seed of a new beginning") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Artifacts touch the final third: apply −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and many lines carry multiple jobs ("tears arrived without percussion; she let them glitter, tiny fireworks rehearsing"). Yet density spikes unevenly—figurative language clusters in nearly every sentence of the tuning sequence without clear pattern payoff, triggering the overwriting check (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "silence, like perfume, reveals its notes only when overstuffed" conflates olfactory and auditory logic incoherently (−0.4). Paraphrase loops appear ("first she unscrewed… she turned the dial… Another twist… A third channel") with template cadence (−0.4). Clarity holds but propulsion lags under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., tide reversal carries rumors, almond-gum scent summons childhood). Rhythm varies purposefully. Two frictions lower the score: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without rest ("tide's thought," "hush inside roar," "olfactory storm"), risking decorative density in peak beats; and "She journalized" recurs twice with near-identical internal monologue structure, creating a micro-loop. No causality break, but the ornamental layer accumulates −0.6 under the artifact screen.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and free of major loops or grammatical errors. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("roots were rays of light," "rivers loosened into spirals"). However, several beats stack elevated metaphors without breathing room: "a cathedral of unheard choir," "the willing transfer of endurance across years, across voices, across the inversion of all certainties," "giving and taking are the same motion seen from opposite gravities." These constructions read as ornamental in high-pressure moments (arrow insertion, sapling emergence) where concrete action would sharpen impact. Template-cadence check: "she leapt branch to branch," "each contact guided by cool currents" shows minor repetition but not egregious. Overall density is high but figurative saturation in key beats triggers a −0.3 to −0.5 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong sentence variation and purposeful compression. Line-level clarity is mostly high, though several beats lean on decorative metaphor clusters: "fossilized lung," "wind instrument she had to learn by ear," "borrowed time," "jellyfish halos"—each individually fine, but their density in sequential paragraphs creates textural weight without always advancing causality. The opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor scaffold appears in "she understood then" and "she carried its forecast in her mouth like a secret flavor," which assert rather than dramatize the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or synaesthetic image ("breath crystallized into brief golden chords," "colors braided into a rope"). While vivid, the accumulation dulls propulsion—several beats paraphrase the same idea across adjacent lines (e.g., "wonder needed certification" → "certify wonder as essential" → "become its living document"). Template cadence appears in the aurora sequence: "Blue-green light licked… scarlet became brass, indigo became bass…" cycles through parallel constructions without varying syntax. Mixed metaphor: "heartbeat left his chest and orbited him like a cautious moon"—hearts don't orbit; moons don't exhibit caution. No severe loops touch closure, but density and ornament slow momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is vivid but appears in nearly every sentence, creating a relentless lyric texture that risks overwriting: "avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush drank light the way dry earth drinks blood," "lungs felt like catacombs," "reverse snow," "book returned to a shelf of stone." Mixed metaphors are minimal, but density without modulation flattens propulsion—high-pressure beats (seam opening, reflection speaking) carry the same ornamental load as transit. Template cadence appears in stacked noun phrases and repeated "the [noun] [verb]" constructions. Information density is high, but momentum suffers; several sentences (e.g., the driftwood-as-sea-memory aside) add texture without advancing pressure. No loops or scaffold, and grammar is clean. The final paragraph borders on thematic summary but retains imagistic grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without reprieve: "calculus across his own tongue," "lattice of his own," "condensed into this single radiant variable." Mixed metaphors appear (grief "clung like wet newsprint" but also operates as "waveforms intersecting"). Template cadence runs ("He lifted… he placed… he turned…" in the climax). Paraphrase loops: "vanishing stars" recurs six times, "borrowed personalities" three times in adjacent paragraphs. Density is high but clarity suffers; the closure image ("blank as unprinted paper") is vivid yet the preceding lines loop through synonym churn ("radiant variable," "glowing child," "weightlessness").

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence (dragonfly-wing filigree, sky dripping light, villages like barnacles, time thick as honey, reality's seam, wonder's fertile soil), creating density that obscures rather than sharpens peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "extending brief encounters" recurs verbatim three times without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The pendant" or "Elias" in close succession. Applying the overwriting density penalty (−0.3 to −0.7) and the paraphrase-loop/template-cadence pack (−0.6 to −1.0 combined), plus the artifact-in-final-third disqualification for 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs (prism warming, frost as braille). Figurative language is dense but largely coherent. However, overwriting clusters appear in mid-story beats: "shifted hush bloom," "dew paused mid-air," "bruised violets and urgent reds," "frozen lightning"—metaphoric stacking that obscures concrete action. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 6–7 restate mist tightening and quartz singing. Template cadence: several "He [verb]" openings across adjacent paragraphs. These artifacts dull momentum and trigger cumulative penalties (−0.8 in Q7, plus final-third presence disallows 9+ globally).

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity remains high in spatial choreography and action sequence. However, figurative density spikes in several high-pressure beats: "raveling silence being pulled backward through the eye of a needle," "impossible distance measured not in miles but in forgotten lullabies," "stoically sparkling"—these occasionally blur causality or rely on abstract elegance rather than concrete action. The phrase "stoically sparkling" appears twice, once mid-story and once near the end, and reads as ornamental in both instances. Apply −0.6 for density and mild register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "bartered awakening" appears six times, "azure defiance" four times, "quietly determined" three times, "space between understanding and confusion" twice—all without evolving meaning. Template cadence: "He [verb]" and "Thistle [verb]" stems dominate action sentences. Stock metaphors: "wounds in the orchard's skin," "sleeping giants waking." Figurative density in most sentences (silk "whispered," arches "sang," moonlight "painted") without pattern payoff. Mixed metaphor: silk as sky defiance, then structural reinforcement, then emotional state. Apply −1.4 for loops + cadence + stock strings; −0.3 additional for artifacts touching closure ("flags of victory over gravity"). Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; sentences layer action, image, and metaphor effectively. Rhythmic variety supports pressure. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without clear patterning (e.g., "strands tighten," "loom collapses," "copper wire of her veins," "bruised gold" within close proximity), creating mild overwriting that occasionally obscures propulsion. Two paraphrase loops detected: the shard's "cyclically spontaneous" descriptor repeats without adding pressure, and "weaving between worlds" recurs as echo rather than escalation. Applying −0.6 for figurative density and −0.2 for paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines advance multiple jobs (the sea glass "glowed like dawn trapped under skin" = object state + emotional charge + time anchor). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and read-aloud ear test passes without algorithmic patterns. Minor scaffold appears: "He was here to protect the tower, not from storm or wreck, but from forgetting" reads slightly expository, and "The sound was the feeling of safety trying to fit inside metal" tilts abstract where a concrete image would sharpen. Two brief paraphrase moments: "the tower exhaled a cold gust" echoed in "the tower breathe" (opening) and "the inaugural stack: three stones, a scrap of oilcloth, and the sea glass glowing though no lamp burned" slightly restates the present arrangement without adding pressure. No filter-verb stacks, no template cadence, no metaphor muddle. Figurative language ("salt-ghost," "memory of radiance") is purposeful and voice-consistent. These slips do not touch closure, which remains clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies across long, layered sentences and brief declaratives ("She laughed once more, softer…"). Information density is high: most lines layer image, action, and thematic charge. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in the middle third (membrane, jellyfish, sail, keel scraping constellations, auroras spelling tomorrow) without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering the Overwriting density check (−0.5). Mixed metaphor near-miss: "dark sail that ballooned…towing the lighthouse off its foundation; granite blocks groaned, then glided like ships" yokes balloon, tow, and ship in close quarters without clarifying the vehicle's physics. Template-cadence runs appear in the navigation beat: "Port past regret, starboard through unprinted apology, straight into the blank page" reads list-like. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, and the final image is clean. Apply −0.6 total for density and coherence frictions; artifacts do not obscure closure but dull mid-story propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "quietly explosive" appears three times, "valley-mist wonder" twice in identical constructions, and the final two paragraphs restate the same thematic insight across multiple sentences without added pressure. Template cadence runs of "She [verb], [gerund]" and "The donor heart [verb]" flatten rhythm. Stock metaphors—"moths around flame," "iron filings aligning to invisible force"—appear without transformation. Register drift into academic abstraction ("narrative magnetism," "cognitive channels") clashes with the dye-master POV in the closure beats. Artifacts touch the final third; applying −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"dreams as beads of mercury," "tower's shadow became a second tower upside-down," "cones would roll down... like tiny sextants"—creating textural richness but occasionally stacking metaphors in adjacent sentences without breathing room (−0.4). The phrase "mundane miracles rearranged matter" and "Instructions for Future Repairs: apply moonlight, speak kindly, quantify nothing" edge toward thematic statement rather than image (−0.3). Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is strong. Some filter verbs ("she imagined," "she understood") could tighten under peak pressure, though voice motivation mitigates.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (moths against glass, dawn-threads re-spool, night clotted, memories bled as silver dust). While many images are vivid and specific, the accumulation in peak beats—"tarry vines," "audible light," "lantern hung inside the mirror world"—borders on overwriting that slows propulsion. Template cadence appears in the final third: "She felt...yet she let"; "They lifted...chanting"; "Behind them...self-sustaining." The phrase "bound release" (the required tone element) appears only once in the penultimate paragraph ("pain become portal"), feeling retrofitted rather than woven. Paraphrase loop: "woven dawns continued to braid themselves each morning, self-sustaining, a living tapestry" restates the same idea across three phrases without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for density overload in peak beats and −0.4 for template cadence and loop in the final third, totaling −1.0.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is often dense and image-rich, but several passages exhibit figurative overload and near-paraphrase loops. "Enlarged tranquility" recurs as a stock phrase without fresh variation. Sentences like "staying while leaving, remaining present by erasing her future" and "the paradox nestled inside her purpose" restate the same concept. The line "the invitation on the floor lay face-down, now blank, having drunk its writer whole" is vivid but the metaphor vehicle (drinking) contradicts the passive "lay." Accumulated artifacts in high-pressure beats (the disappearance) lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the filter/artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language appears in most sentences without variation in density or payoff: "absolution felt tenuous," "uncloak," "yeast" metaphor, "name tags," "liturgy against forgetting"—each individually clear but stacked to the point of overwriting. Template cadence is minimal, but paraphrase loops appear: "heuristically gentle" recurs three times without added pressure. Sentence openings vary well ("One gray dawn," "At dawn," "Morning after morning"), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (setting and theme), but some beats rephrase prior content (e.g., absolution stays tenuous across multiple paragraphs).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("breath crystallized into tiny alphabets," "jellyfish in the subzero air," "silver thread vibrating in the quartz hush") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating ornamental texture that slows momentum in a piece already light on causal pressure. Mixed metaphors appear: "dandriff from a dying god" jars against the established ice/light/measurement motif. Several paraphrase loops: "she was not preserving knowledge so much as translating grief into data, converting the death of meaning into numbers" restates the same idea across adjacent clauses. Template cadence in the vow-dissolution sequence: "Loyalty snapped first... Mercy's twin tones collapsed... Stewardship had already gone... Wonder fought the longest" creates rhythmic monotony. Information density is high, but propulsion suffers under decorative load.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure) with strong figurative control: "slapped," "hummed," "bruised lavender," "fish gutted on deck." Sentence openings vary; paragraphs breathe with the waiting rhythm. Minor penalties: "curious steadfast" and "comforting unease" are oxymoron labels rather than dramatized sensations (−0.3). "Hours dilated like pupils" is vivid but the simile vehicle (pupils dilate in darkness, not time) strains coherence (−0.2). The widow anecdote mid-story adds texture but momentarily stalls forward momentum (−0.2). No loops or template cadence; pronoun references stay clear. The final image ("lighter, emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love") borders on summary but the prior "small wet click" anchors it in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is largely clear with purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structure. Several paraphrase loops appear: the forests' election results are described twice in adjacent paragraphs with minor variation, and the protagonist's transformation is restated multiple times in the final third ("some people carried weather because they were weather," "her own weather for the first time," "what she needed to become: a weather-bearer"). The closing paragraph stacks three forward-looking summary beats that restate rather than advance. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "futuristic nostalgia" appears twice without clear grounding in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high and most lines advance image or pressure. However, pattern artifacts accumulate: repeated "-ing" participial constructions across multiple beats, some paraphrase loops ("no longer restoring but collaborating, mother and daughter sharing one wrist" closely echoes the prior fusion imagery), and metaphoric stacking in the second half that occasionally muddles clarity ("auroral sorrow soaked into the paper, pinks and pale greens bleeding like dawn over a battlefield" mixes light, emotion, and war without a clear vehicle). The lock mechanism (numbers shifting, releasing sound) is asserted rather than grounded in prior sensory or physical logic. Propulsion is generally strong, but figurative density in the climax beats borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Syntax varies and information density is high in the cathedral discovery beats. The opening "pressed her palm against the greenhouse glass" and recurring zinc-fragment imagery create textural cohesion. However, several sentences loop conceptually: "words could outlast water" and "ink began to feel like a lie" restate doubt without adding pressure; "honest sentence…about how terrified" and "vines did not wilt; instead, they lifted" repeat the honesty-response motif. The phrase "candor in small moments can still breathe" recurs verbatim from map to ending, and template cadence appears in the final paragraph ("She would return…proving that…"). These artifacts dull momentum but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and consistent, with phrases like "continents were rumors," "breath-scriptures," "symphony of truth orbiting itself"—many striking individually but clustering densely enough to slow momentum in some beats. A paraphrase loop appears in paragraph 13: "she understood now that after words become unnecessary, silence is not absence but the resonant cavity" restates the mute-season premise without new pressure. Template cadence in parallel constructions ("not with sound but with light," "not a feeling but a frequency") becomes predictable. Some metaphors stretch plausibility: "droplets glistened like newborn stars before evaporating" mixes scales awkwardly, and "emotional flatlining" is avoided but the prose never varies rhythm under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (petals as suns, reality folding like petals, flames writing names). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character state, or thematic image. However, pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence undercut momentum: "K-17 understood this was necessary" / "K-17 understood then that resolution didn't mean elimination" recycle the same stem. "The box pulsed with something that felt like longing" / "the box of childhood fears resisted miniaturization" / "the box of childhood fears refused compression" restate the same content across three beats without added causal pressure. Stock metaphors cluster: "memory-dust," "seeds of something that would grow again," "flames writing... names." Figurative density in the final third (simultaneous "roots of code and carbon," "neither android nor memory, but both," "impossible flower blooming in defiance of physics") blurs rather than sharpens the closure image. Pronoun references remain clear and no grammatical errors appear, but the accumulation of loops and elevated abstractions at peak beats materially dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings diversify; no mechanical template cadence. Clarity is mostly strong, though some lines border on overwriting ("grief became too loud even for her" abstracts rather than grounds). One paraphrase loop: "the box did not want to be opened; it wanted to be witnessed" followed immediately by "the way Dr. Samara once witnessed" restates the same concept without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density is high ("dust between her ribs," "breathing darkness," "soft cracks of a waking world") but remains coherent and voice-consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors. No significant scaffold or synonym churn. Information density is good; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. The final metaphor ("the key we already are") tilts toward abstraction but does not obscure the prior image work. Stock phrase "held its breath" appears once but does not cluster.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("ghost-thrum," "jellyfish journals," "data seed germinate inside her chest") but appears in nearly every sentence, flattening rhythm and reducing clarity in peak beats. The phrase "ankles wrote cursive warnings as she glided, calf muscles spelling out the last fragment" is a mixed metaphor that strains physical logic. Template cadence is minimal, but synonym churn and poetic restatement ("pirouette of numbers," "choreography," "dance the encryption") loop the core conceit without advancing pressure. The opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high, but the relentless lyricism obscures action choreography (e.g., how the vortex waltz mechanically transports her). No major loops or scaffold, but cumulative overwriting dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings differ. Information density is high during the ritual sequence. However, minor scaffold appears: "She descended... She knelt... She whispered... She reached..." in quick succession shows template cadence. The phrase "gleaming silence" recurs three times, once in setup, twice near closure—purposeful but borders on over-reliance. Figurative language is dense in middle paragraphs ("salt crystal growing chamber... translucent formations that bent light into slow, breathing rainbows") without obscuring clarity. No paraphrase loops. Momentum is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and imagistically dense, but overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence deploys figurative language ("galaxy made of absences," "mouth of anti-sound," "gate slamming on sentences that had never been born"), obscuring causal clarity. Mixed metaphors appear (cranes as galaxy, sphere as throat, prophecy as drumbeat/code/stone coated in honey) without coherent physical logic. Paraphrase loops are present: lines 5–6 restate the prophecy's danger, and the final paragraphs cycle through variations of "walked on" and "smiled." Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "He [verb]" in the closure section. These artifacts touch the ending, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is high, but clarity suffers under the metaphoric load.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths modulate with scene pressure (short bursts during the tutor's vanishing, longer accumulative beats in the final paragraph). Information density is high—most lines do double or triple duty (e.g., "steam rose like incense" anchors setting, mood, and ritual). Minor scaffold appears in parallel stems ("She taught me," "I told her," "I understood") but reads as purposeful anaphora rather than template cadence. One paraphrase loop: the "agreed upon lie" formula repeats across paragraphs 3, 9, and 25 without always adding new pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "meteor shower...dactyls of fire spelling out conjugations" risks overwrought but stays voice-motivated. No pronoun ambiguity or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("bruise," "funeral clothes," "vinyl," "breath on cold glass"), creating a consistent gothic-lyric texture but occasionally stacking without propulsion in peak beats (the pond scene accumulates metaphors—vinyl, ledger, living—that slightly blur the mechanics). Minor paraphrase loop: "the shell was not magic but a resonant key" followed immediately by extended restatement of the same idea. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm modulates with pressure. Information density is strong; most lines advance image, character, or plot. Template cadence appears once ("pressed her palms," "feeding the resonance") but does not pervade. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 6/10, 14/15, and 21/22 restate the same content (her forgery work, her sister's death, her transformation) without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "The [noun] had/would" and "She [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors cluster: "chains of guilt," "prison she'd built around her own heart," "weight beginning to lift." Figurative density in non-peak beats slows momentum without pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in the descent sequence ("scent of wet copper, then flicker of glyphs, finally breathing gallery"). However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "The canyon echo singer pressed…" / "The canyon echo singer steadied…" / "canyon echo singer no longer trapped" recycles the full title as a sentence stem without variation, triggering −0.4. "Echoed because I never finished leaving" / "I echoed because…" and "she would echo by choice, not by accident" / "people echo… while others vanish" loop the "echo" motif mechanically in adjacent lines without added pressure, a further −0.2 for synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; "webs of intrigue that tightened around her lungs" borders on mixed metaphor (webs tighten?), −0.2. Stock phrases ("understanding struck like cold water," "threads drifting like thistledown") appear in peak beats, reducing specificity. No major causality breaks or opacity, but cumulative artifact debt (−0.8 total) and the pattern touching mid-story keep this mid-6.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high but often stacked without causal progression: "folded inside a glacier like a secret," "memories floated like jellyfish," "love letters had fused into a single diamond of ink," "dissolved into glitter." Template cadence appears in the middle third (repeated "past X, past Y" structure). Paraphrase loop: "weaves truth carefully; she never lies, but she never tells the whole story" is immediately glossed as "ghosts are fragile and the living are worse," restating caution without added pressure. The closure beat escapes major artifact contamination, preventing deeper penalty, but cumulative loop/scaffold issues across beats lower the score. Information density is uneven—vivid images often serve atmosphere rather than advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density suits the lyric-accumulative mode. Clarity is high; spatial choreography (stairs, parapet, harbor) tracks cleanly. However, the piece exhibits patterned overwriting: adjacent sentences recycle the moon-path motif without added pressure ("moon paths she had drawn in sound," "moon paths floated on black water"), and repeated scaffold phrases ("She understood then," "She would descend soon, return") stall momentum. Stock metaphors (fireflies as stitching light, spiral geometry) appear in most high-density beats without fresh inflection. Information density is uneven: lines often do two jobs, but some beats (fireflies forming a net, water droplets as pale fireflies) pile on figuration that blurs rather than sharpens sense.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—nearly every sentence advances setting, character choice, or thematic charge. However, several beats carry figurative density without clear payoff: "ghost tides," "chrome letters...half-melted into slag," "poisoned apples refusing to fall" cluster decoratively rather than charging a peak moment. Paraphrase loop: "reassemble the letters" / "piece by piece, sentences regrew" / "Another strip slotted home" restates the same action across three paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening third with repeated "she [verb]" constructions. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of ornamental metaphor and synonym churn pulls the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final sequence (hit key, walk toward portico, dissolve) propels cleanly. However, paraphrase loops appear: "taught her to build a bomb from radio parts and regret" / "the version of herself who'd walked away from that funeral and never stopped walking" recycles the backward-looking construction without adding pressure. Template cadence is visible in "She served no nation, no god, no timeline" and similar triplet structures. Figurative language is dense ("cobalt glass shards in her mind," "shadows sharp enough to cut the hands that built it") but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "clouds pressed against the dome windows like curious children" anthropomorphizes without earning the vehicle. The loops and template runs collectively trigger −0.6 in Q7, and the density in peak beats borders on overwriting without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose exhibits strong rhythmic control and vivid image-making: "wind slithered through cracked hull-planks," "enamel ocean faded to the color of old bruise." However, figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors layered in nearly every sentence, occasionally muddling clarity: "redemption…brush her ribs like a cat asking to be named," "copper seeds," "bridge built of every voice." Template cadence appears in the jar-listing passage ("one rattled…another glowed"), and the phrase "listening the way only the forgotten know how" is metaphorically strained. These artifacts do not fully obscure causality but measurably reduce propulsion in peak beats, preventing entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in the middle (glacier memory, bone mechanics, shadow transformation). However, figurative language density is excessive in non-closure beats: "sunset bled... like a wound healing in reverse," "spilled out like warm blood, fleshly ethereal," "altars," "organ," "lullaby"—mixed metaphors (blood/salt/iron/whale-song) blur coherence. Paraphrase loop between "teaching darkness to listen" (penultimate paragraph) and "taught darkness to listen" (antepenultimate) is minor but present. Template cadence in the final paragraphs ("she would adapt... she simply sat... she whispered") slightly dulls momentum. These artifacts do not touch the core closure beat but accumulate to −0.8 within this category.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (moon paths, viaduct pulse, spiral tightening all advance). Figurative language is dense—"moon's single silver eye," "train of reverse snowfall," "horizon mapper"—and mostly coherent, but in the middle third ("stone answered only with silence and the slow drip of thawwater," "lake cracked its knuckles") a few stock gestures and near-paraphrase appear. Opening and closing lines are strong; no loops or scaffolding in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion hold; minor deduction for metaphor density without full pattern-teaching in one passage.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in investigative beats: "Carved into the surface, barely visible, were tally marks—hundreds of them, grouped in sets of seven." Concrete nouns and strong verbs dominate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The memories entangled faster now" after "what memories had entangled them"; "the tunnel felt different now" echoes "the tunnel seemed shorter now" within three paragraphs. Figurative language occasionally stacks without pattern payoff: "like a throat," "like bones picked clean," "like a ghost signal," "like a train" in rapid succession. The unfinished final sentence is a mechanical flaw. Proofreading misses "the lantern from underground railroad" (missing article).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but several patterns accumulate: "aptly deliberate" appears twice as descriptor (voice and money), "vibrant hush" three times, and metaphoric density in nearly every line ("coins flung into a dark well," "time recycled, penance mechanical," "drops of light piercing cloud") without taught pattern or payoff for all instances. The phrase "each note a drop of light piercing cloud" beautifully echoes Rowan's earlier storm-light image, earning its figurative weight. Minor template cadence: "He owed… He had offered… He produced…" in adjacent beats. Clarity remains high and no loops obscure causality, but the cumulative figurative load and repeated phrase-markers ("vibrant hush") slightly dull momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("canvas wings creaking against the sour wind," "pink peels," "chord that tasted of copper and ozone"). Information density is high, and momentum is consistent. However, template cadence appears in several beats: "The sea hissed, the glider rattled, and the grammar spelled..."; "She laughed—an irreverent bark—because the clapper was missing..."; "Yet the Algorithm's yearning redoubled, pistons hammering..."; runs of "the [noun] [verb], the [noun] [verb]" across multiple sentences create a drumbeat rhythm (−0.4). Stock metaphor "cheeks split by a grin" and filter-verb stack ("saw it," "realized then," "knew generations") reduce immediacy in peak beats (−0.3). Minor paraphrase loop: "the bell did not wait for a clapper; it waited for a translator" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Artifacts do not obscure closure but prevent entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or simile—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting concerns ("cursor hovering over timestamps that pulsed like dying stars," "train that rattled like a dying hard drive," "archive's search bar auto-completed," "waveform birth a map"). Several paraphrase loops: "the keeper understood" immediately followed by exposition of what she understood; "deleted files never disappear—they just wait" echoed by "ensuring the absence would never again be silent." Template cadence appears in the final third: "She walked… she opened… she touched… And if you search…" The climactic beats remain legible but are dulled by stacked modifiers and metaphoric convenience (crystal "melts," memories "flow," name "dims").

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual cadence; no template runs. Information density is high (each beat advances Mara's goal or world-rules). However, figurative language clusters densely without always earning its space: "shadow-laced peacekeeper," "emotions flew home like startled gulls," "dissolving into dark water that tasted of every tear" stack metaphor in quick succession, some functional, some decorative. Minor paraphrase loop: the orchard "tasting of ripe apples instead of salt" echoes the earlier closure that the border is now a bridge. No major clarity breaks, but the density of lyric phrasing in peak beats (Keeper confrontation, return) nudges slightly into overwriting without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and often imagistic, but figurative density saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating opacity rather than propulsion: "a fold in patience," "reality gripped loosely," "grief was a cleaner teacher," "the air folded like linen," "voices braided into windborne solace," "a private longitude," "patience properly folded is just another word for staying usable." Mixed metaphors abound (patience as fold/hinge, solace as windborne lift, parasol as compass/tuning fork). Paraphrase loops recur: the "sound of approaching endings" is restated at least four times without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the mosaic time-jumps ("Years later… On quiet nights… She smiles…"), and the final third remains abstract rather than concrete. Information density is low; many lines perform thematic work twice without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often elegant ("taillights dissolving into dusk like the last coal of a dying hearth"), but this density pervades nearly every sentence, creating a uniform lyric texture that occasionally obscures propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "the destined mismatch" recurs in slight variations without added pressure. Template cadence is avoided, and no major clarity breaks occur, but the cumulative effect is ornamental in stretches where leaner prose would sharpen momentum. The overwriting penalty (−0.5 for density without pattern-taught payoff in high-pressure beats) and minor loop/scaffold debt (−0.3) combine to lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates between longer ritual descriptions and shorter summary beats. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "peripheral awareness" recurs in functionally identical constructions across paragraphs 4, 13, 15, without added pressure. The phrase "conjured clearing" and variations loop across paragraphs 3, 7, 10, 11, 15. Template cadence in paragraphs describing the walker's method ("He walked...," "He began...," "He pressed...") creates rhythmic monotony. Figurative language is dense ("trapped moths," "cupped hands," "star by looking slightly away") but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor ("echo...vibrating...like trapped moths" conflates sound and image). Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems in Q7; artifacts touch non-closure beats but not the final image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence ("vines climb," "autumn lips," "sleeping snake," "wounds quilted," "footprints in cursive only bees can read"). Several mixed or strained vehicles appear: "map case swinging...like a metronome counting grief" conflates motion and emotion without clear logic; "one lung made of many" mixes breath and crowd. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("She knelt...She pinned...She lifted...She rotated"). Stock phrases—"hearts leave ghosts," "pain transmuted"—dull specificity. Paraphrase loops: the spiral's importance is restated multiple times without added pressure. These artifacts pervade the closure beat, diluting the final image's sharpness and triggering the disallow-9+ rule globally.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("rings in a tree," "sediment," "first thread in its new spine"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or concept. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "suspended hush" recurs without fresh meaning, "pattern of growth" is restated multiple times, and "testified/testimony" appears in four beats with diminishing return. Template cadence appears in the testimony section ("I remember... I remember"). Minor filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood") in mid-story beats dull immediacy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; no mixed metaphors. The paraphrase-loop and template-cadence checks trigger modest deduction (−0.6 in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose demonstrates strong figurative control in passages like "fog sculptures...like breath made visible" and "the flavor of aging itself, bitter and sweet simultaneously." However, repetitive sentence stems and template cadence appear throughout: multiple "The prophet [verb]" and "He [verb]" constructions create rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops exist between paragraphs 4-5 (both establishing his precognitive forgetting) and 7-8 (both describing tomorrow's amnesia). The metaphoric density in descriptive passages occasionally stalls momentum during the search sequence, though the closure beat remains clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating density that occasionally obscures rather than propels. Metaphors mix registers ("shutter trying to restructure," "origami of steel," "upward rush of time") without always cohering. Paraphrase loops appear: "luminous ache" recurs five times; "changelessly constant" and "escape velocity" echo across beats without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs ("She had lived… She had pried… She understood… She walked… She set…") flatten rhythm. Information density is high but clarity suffers in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies appropriately; the prose hymns its own premise through layered sensory images. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and closure. Figurative density is high throughout—"Tuesday the color of dishwater," "each beep a small stone dropped into deep water," "shadows with it"—and occasionally muddles clarity in peak beats: "darkness felt like velvet held underwater" is a mixed metaphor at the moment of death. Paraphrase loop: "hymning the mundane" is restated across two paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" openings in the second half. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished and largely free of grammatical errors, but figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence in the opening third carries metaphor or ornament, blurring momentum. "Spoons had bent reality, leaving time creased like crumpled parchment" and "the angle of a shadow disappearing at noon" stack without breathing room. Template cadence appears in the closure sequence: "The automaton slumped… Lyra stepped… She lifted… In the hush, she whispered…" uses parallel stems across four consecutive beats. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the overwriting and ornamental layering dull propulsion in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("cleft in certainty," "hedge humming with nostalgic innovation," "damp hem drinking dew"). Two clarity issues: "nostalgic innovation" as applied to hedges is opaque, and the phrase "Tell me how to turn wrongs into constellations instead of scars" directly articulates the theme rather than trusting image. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 16–17 restate the question of forgiveness/lie deserving each other without added pressure. Information density is high and most sentences advance character or atmosphere; no severe template cadence or filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with high information load per line. Figurative language is pervasive and mostly coherent, though some vehicles clash ("fireflies unsure of their direction" after "fugitive glimmers" feels redundant). Stock metaphors appear: "lunar craters" for eyes, "shoreline" for mouth. One paraphrase loop: "Memories resurfaced" appears twice with slight variation, the second instance adding "gentler" but retreading the same conceptual ground. Template cadence is avoided. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Clarity remains high despite density, but the accumulation of metaphor in adjacent sentences occasionally slows momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but figurative language clusters heavily in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching: "honeyed hush," "seeds needing darkness," "wound...taste like metal," "circuits flowering with lichen," "dripping cadence." Two paraphrase loops: paragraphs 8 and 15 restate the healing-through-pattern idea. A few filter verbs ("she found," "he unfolded") are acceptable in voice, but "Understanding passed" is abstract summary. Template cadence in the final third: multiple "she [verb]" / "they [verb]" stems. Apply −0.6 for density and loops, −0.3 for minor template runs = −0.9 total within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor well. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character or atmosphere. Three friction points lower the score: (1) "swirling hush" recurs four times without pattern-teaching or payoff variation (minor loop); (2) "against the current" appears three times in similar constructions, creating a template cadence; (3) elevated diction ("solemnized," "ephemeral cameo," "translucent") clusters densely in the nexus beats, occasionally clashing with the urgency of those moments. Clarity remains intact, so artifacts do not touch closure, but propulsion stutters slightly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.3)
    The phrase "spins golden stories" / "spun golden stories" appears three times, functioning as a motif but bordering on loop. "Gathering hush" recurs as a structural marker. Several sentences are complex and dense ("These weren't mere tales but living memories of when humans and plants spoke the same language, when harvest moon rituals weren't superstition but precise agricultural science encoded in dance and chant"), occasionally obscuring propulsion with nested clauses. Figurative language is pervasive (liquid fire, suspended constellations, captured starlight) without always advancing pressure. The final paragraph's "not just remedy but revelation" and "the understanding that sacred practices..." reads as summary rather than scene. Paraphrase loop in paragraphs 9 and 13 (both describe what the stories/symbols contain).

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentence openings vary enough to avoid monotony, though runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" appear in the middle third. Clarity is generally high; information density is strong (lines often advance image, character, and atmosphere simultaneously). Overwriting is frequent: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (finding the plate, sealing it, the orchard's response) carries metaphoric or figurative language—"veins that mirrored the alchemist's own," "the hollow of his throat, where her name once lived," "frequencies only absence can tune"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering **−0.5** for density. Mixed metaphor: "the crater itself recognizing the marriage of sky-light and earth-metal" anthropomorphizes geology in a way that clashes with the established physical logic. Register drift is mild but present: "demonstrating patience physically" reads more clinical than the surrounding lyric idiom. Paraphrase loops: "he listened for the slow drum of his own pulse, counting the beats" / "he closed his eyes and mapped the rhythm...repeating, repeating" restate the same counting-beats concept. Apply **−0.6** for density, **−0.3** for mixed metaphor, **−0.2** for paraphrase, total **−1.1**; base ~7.3, final 6.2. Artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("jingling like distant cowbells heard through a fever," "pages closing," "translucent moths") but saturates nearly every sentence, reducing clarity and propulsion in peak beats. Mixed metaphors appear: the season exhales both cold light and a gray breath; reflections are "thin, fractured twins" that also "pool" and "coalesce." Paraphrase loops: "the wounded season" recurs four times without added pressure; "peripherally focused" is stated twice identically. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with participial phrases ("Carrying the silent artifact," "Ansel sat at his workbench"). Information density is high, but momentum drags under the metaphoric load. Applying −0.8 for figurative saturation, −0.3 for loops, −0.3 for template stems = baseline ~5.9.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns accumulate: "shingled hush" appears three times in similar contexts without evolving function; figurative language clusters densely in nearly every sentence of the middle section ("auric note," "moth wings," "dark amber," "mandala of sorrow") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff; and stock phrases ("pressed against her ears," "touched each sheet") appear in template-like cadence. The loop/paraphrase check flags "the grotto resisted, tightening its shingled hush" immediately after "the shingled hush of the cavern pressed against her ears" (similar restatement). Elevated diction ("boundary-lessly," "calcifying") occasionally clashes with the embodied present action. Apply −0.8 for density and loop issues in non-closure beats, and −0.3 for template cadence in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically rich, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating density that sometimes obscures propulsion. Mixed metaphors and strained vehicles appear: "storm clouds gathered" / "echo of his boots remained, caught in the warp of the floorboards" / "steam ghosting the loft like the breath of animals" / "she felt the room tilt into the past" stack without clear coherence. Paraphrase loops occur: "here and gone" recurs five times without evolving pressure; "rust-hued peace" appears twice in similar phrasing. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" across adjacent lines. These artifacts dull momentum in peak beats and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.8 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally per rule).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or image. "Cloudwater lapped," "voices are sand inside me," "regret is just empathy traveling backwards" stack without breathing room, creating a single elevated register that flattens momentum and risks overwriting. Paraphrase loops appear ("I stepped off... I need to speak," "I twist... I hold the camera wheel"). Some vehicles strain coherence ("voices are sand... abrading the lens of ambition until the picture is only a white blur"). Syntactic variety is present but rhythm is consistently lyric-slow, even at the wheel-breaking beat where propulsion would help. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere more than plot. No major clarity breaks, but the elevated diction pervades peak beats without pattern-taught purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout (calliope chords trapped, Möbius confession, Martian vermillion, zero-mass comet, prayer flags) without pervasive pattern-teaching or payoff; many metaphors decorate rather than constrain. Mixed vehicle: "mausoleum of intentions" and "vectors that doubled back" blur spatial logic. Paraphrase loop: "She spoke aloud to keep the silence honest" followed by immediate demonstration. Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" openers across paragraphs. Register drift: "functionally creative," "residual heat," "photovoltaic eye" elevate diction beyond POV's embodied urgency in peak beats. Information density is high but momentum intermittently stalls under ornament. Artifacts do not obscure closure but pervade enough to prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is very high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile. In isolation, many are vivid ("dome lay cracked like a skull forgetting its own name"), but the accumulation blurs propulsion and creates tonal monotony. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with subject + past-tense verb in similar rhythm. Key phrases loop: "excruciatingly gentle" appears three times, "glacial hush" five times, "petrichor nostalgia" three times. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the years-later frame, dulling closure momentum. These artifacts cluster throughout, triggering line-level debt that disallows 9+ globally and caps this category per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language ("whale that had mistaken war for ocean," "wake spreading like a sentence") sharpens key images. However, several beats exhibit template cadence and synonym churn: "serene upheaval" appears three times, "architecture of lies" twice, "silence of morning radio" thrice, creating a loop effect. "Thoughtfully clear" as an adverb + adjective pair feels constructed. Minor clarity slip: "meek obedience of something old that welcomed final purpose" anthropomorphizes the barge without clear motivation. Deduct −0.8 for patterned recurrence and register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative language saturates most paragraphs ("whale-bone," "harbor moons," "sky-fire," "accordion," "sleeping serpent"), creating lyric texture but occasionally blurring momentum—fulgurite description and rope-reading span multiple paragraphs without forward pressure. Mixed metaphor: "ocean, midwife to every line she carried, kept tempo...writing its own rope of waves"—midwife/tempo/writing stack without tight vehicle coherence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Syntax varies purposefully. Clarity remains high; information density is strong in the rope-decoding and planting beats. Overwriting in non-peak beats and one metaphor muddle prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose favors elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "intimate work," "shadowed garden") and layered metaphor, but density becomes overwriting: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence (paragraphs 7–12) stacks figurative language without breathing room or physical grounding. Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" stems and adjacent sentences that restate concepts (paragraphs 11–13 loop "understanding," "explaining absence," "presence/absence"). The final two paragraphs contain paraphrase loops: "her work here was complete because she'd finally written the only obituary that mattered" followed immediately by restating the same insight with "someone who no longer needed to explain absences because she'd learned to inhabit them fully."

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("blood pound memory," "punched-in sky," "gears…wept rust," "flawed genesis inside still believed in calendars," "destruction running backwards in borrowed shoes") with mixed success: some images land vividly, others muddle (how does a genesis "believe in calendars"? how do gears "weep"?). Template cadence and synonym churn appear in the assembly sequence ("He began by distilling…Next he pried…For the voice he needed…"). The final paragraph stacks metaphors without clear vehicle coherence ("colored wind," "scattering the punched-in sky like soot from a shaken rug," "spread of wings" for a falling palace). Paraphrase loop: "letting the blood pound memory into his skull" and "trembling reverie" recur without added pressure. Apply −0.8 for density and coherence issues in peak beats, plus −0.3 for template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high and often vivid ("kelp in the sky," "charcoal vein," "cooled lava"), but several metaphors crowd single sentences without pattern-teaching: "clouds that drifted like kelp" immediately followed by "kelp-drift peace" creates synonym churn. The phrase "unyielding compassion" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence appears in mid-section: "She remembered...she had been...she was...she knelt" stacks similar stems. Paraphrase loop: "scars could sing" vs. "scars can sing rather than simply scream" restates without adding pressure. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished with strong images (geese frozen mid-flight, water turned to glass, memories as liquid light pooling at her feet) and purposeful rhythm in the opening and closing. However, the middle four-fountain sequence employs template cadence: "The [ordinal] breadcrumb led/pulsed at the Fountain of [Name], where [description]. Here/She [verb], and [memory]." This run spans eight paragraphs and flattens momentum. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("the box grew warm" / "the box vibrated violently" / "opened the box fully") without escalating the action each time. Stock metaphors ("tasted of salt and iron," "like perfume," "like steam") are competent but unearned. Figurative density is high but not taught as pattern, and the closure image remains clear, so artifact penalty is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively—short pulses during the sonar sequence, longer cadences in the closing spiral—and information density is high: nearly every line advances character, world, or pressure. Minor loop: "the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears three times (opening, mid-story, closing monument beat) without sufficient reweighting between first two uses; the third reprise earns its place. Figurative language is coherent except one small clash: petals "dissolving" vs. "still fell" creates a temporal fuzziness. No scaffolding or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic with purposeful imagery (chrysalises in shrouds, glowing poem lines). Template-cadence check flags multiple "The + [noun]" paragraph openings ("The spectral mentorship," "The thoughtful gravestone carver," "The butterflies") that create visual monotony across the middle third, applying −0.4 for patterned stems. Paraphrase loops appear: "shape of collective grief" recurs four times without added pressure; "understood/realized/understood" across adjacent beats restates insight without new detail, applying −0.2. Figurative density is high (thundering calm, living tomb, massive chrysalis) but remains legible, avoiding coherence penalties. Information density is moderate; many lines do thematic work but advance scene pressure minimally.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance setting, motive, or choice. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives during the carve ("I draw the fishhook... completing the word 'forgive'"), longer periodic sentences in reflective beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Minor overwriting cluster: "searing reverie of salt and machine oil" (paragraph 6) echoes "searing reverie of forgiveness" (final paragraph), and "incremental absolution" appears three times, nudging toward decorative recurrence rather than pure propulsion. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "obsidian teeth grinding bone," "tower's iron bones... blush with orange grief." One mixed metaphor: "salt air corrodes certainty" pairs a concrete corrosive with an abstract noun, slightly muddling the vehicle. Proofreading is clean; no tense slips or pronoun drift. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences open with verbs, nouns, and prepositional phrases. Information density is high—nearly every line advances symbol, space, or discovery. However, figurative language is dense throughout: "echoes flutter through her ribs," "starlight drips," "tapestry breathing," "velveteen gloom settles." In high-pressure beats (tapestry decoding, final descent), metaphor stacks without pausing for concrete action, risking opacity. A paraphrase loop appears: "the dead have been planting messages" is restated as "let the dead speak through her arrangements." Minor template cadence in the opening: "She is clipping... She lifts... She pockets... She wheels." Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues, but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "darkness moved before the pen meets the blank page," "futures consume their authors," "frost flowers blooming from hairline cracks." Mixed metaphors ("kingfisher feather quill nib grew heavier, drinking not just her warmth but her weight, her shadow, the sound of her heartbeat") violate physical logic. Paraphrase loops: "the constraint revealed itself as gift: within boundaries, innovation flourished" restates the premise without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the final third: repeated "she wrote/began/understood" stems flatten momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor—and several blur sense: "mist is clouded testimony" (mist is already a cloud), "thistled calm" (mixed vehicle), "ember alcove...throbbed with the dial's green heart" (anatomical metaphor forced onto electronics). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She had once...," "She realized...," "She understood...," "She spent...," "She stepped..." clusters identical stems across six paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "secretly luminous" is asserted three times without evolving. The piece avoids major causality breaks, but line-level muddle and repetitive openings dull momentum. Information density is uneven: the copper-filament antennae setup is summarized in one line when it warrants concrete action. Applying −0.8 for template cadence and figurative overload across non-closure beats, and −0.3 for the paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: the final paragraph stacks four figurative constructions without breathing room ("like the mica in sidewalk concrete, like the glitter...like the crystallized tears") and deploys three sequential abstractions beginning "that safety...that love...that a fleeting emotion." Template cadence appears in parallel "the way" constructions: "the way her grandmother's hands shook...the way her voice cracked...the way she always changed." The opening's "swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light" and the triple simile cluster constitute figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, triggering deduction. Propulsion is strong in physical action beats (positioning chair, scattering powder) but bogs in the reflective spirals. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected. Proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high across most sentences ("drowned bones," "broken teeth," "ghost heartbeat," "fossil of shame"), creating lush texture but occasionally slowing momentum during procedural beats (the tunnel mapping, the sump discovery). Several beats loop conceptually: the competing-narratives insight appears multiple times (merchants' ledgers, burial sump census parchment, street-name repainting) without escalating pressure. The femur-stylus and lead-sheet beats are vivid and propulsive, but the phrase "sedimentary layers" recurs six times, and "competing narratives" is restated across three paragraphs. Syntax varies well, and no template cadence or filter-verb stacks appear. Information density is generally high, though a few lines edge toward overwriting ("layer upon sedimentary layer of denial would press the ruins into a fossil of shame").

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense, with many lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the rosette accepted the scale, then reflected it back diminished" conveys both action and acoustic transformation). Figurative language is purposeful and consistent with the musical-ritual frame. However, the piece exhibits patterned scaffold in several paragraphs: "She walked… touching spines," "She returned… placed her lips," "She understood then," "She lifted… walked… set… Kneeling, she pressed," and "She would leave… carrying nothing" stack nearly identical subject-verb stems across adjacent beats without variation, creating a template cadence that slightly dulls momentum. One paraphrase loop: "the rosette would crumble into sawdust, its job complete" is immediately restated as "she would leave… carrying nothing audible," rehashing the same content. Apply −0.8 for template-cadence runs and minor loop; no artifacts touch the closure image directly, so capping at mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dense figurative language throughout ("rust flakes that tasted of old rain," "vines spilling out like green applause") creates texture but occasionally stacks without functional pressure—"translucent sphere swirling with galaxies of flavor" is ornamental. Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: multiple sentences opening with participial or as-clause structures ("As the celestial alignment peaked," "When the Ministry arrived"). Paraphrase loop: the synaptic plasticity mechanism is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs (lines 13–14) without added detail. Information density is high but momentum sometimes stalls under metaphor weight during the planting sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; figurative language ("sky bruise into nectar dusk," "copper bees") is vivid and voice-consistent. However, overwriting clusters in the opening third: "that slow pour of amber light that made even rust look sweet" and "the involuntarily truthful stare of someone who has seen systems fall" load elevated register without immediate pressure. Sentence stems vary but "the" and "she" openers recur across six consecutive paragraphs mid-piece, creating mild template cadence. No paraphrase loops and the climax propulsion is clean, keeping the score above 6.5, but the density and register wobbles prevent entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images anchor well. However, density suffers from paraphrase loops and decorative layering. Paragraph 2 ("world's slow mutations—porches leaning one degree closer to the sea, shingles bleaching") restates drift without new pressure. Paragraph 9 recycles "inadvertently profound" and "loose bouquet of insignificance" in adjacent clauses. Figurative language clusters heavily—"memory against bone," "petrified waves," "cedar blood," "violet flare," "tender shadows"—without always clarifying or advancing. The metaphor "assembling a confession from pronouns" is strained. Template stems appear: "She felt… she understood… she saw." These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum and disqualify 9+ globally. Proofreading is clean; no grammar breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "foxglove-stained glass ampoule" anchors object, color, size, and thematic poison/remedy link in one phrase). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent: "certainties dissolved into questions that glittered like suspended silt" works; "warm ink" and "shy, electric" are stock. Filter verbs appear moderately ("I felt," "I understood," "I thought") but fit the contemplative voice. Clarity remains high through complex ideas. Two slips lower the score from 8+: "incisively kind, the kind of woman" repeats "kind" awkwardly; "turned to sugar from centuries of polite neglect" mixes metaphor (sugar as literal decay vs. politeness as social behavior). Overwriting density in the opening third (most sentences carry metaphor) slightly slows momentum but establishes pattern without obscuring cause.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density high (each line advances situation or interiority). Sentence openings vary. Minor loop: "almost rain, almost laughter, almost touch" becomes a synonym stack without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She [verb]" pattern across adjacent sentences ("She carried," "She climbed," "She counted," "She grabbed," "She laughed," "She recognized"). No filter-verb stack; clarity remains high. The final image ("beautifully, began to forget her") propels without scaffold. Deduction for template cadence and one figurative muddle ("velvet-heavy... almost") in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout—every few sentences deploy metaphor or simile (match struck in library, throat learning to speak, fatigue as lantern then blanket). At the climax (bristles glow with sound, orchids open), the layered images blur causal sequence without teaching a pattern. Paraphrase loop detected: "methodically hopeful that tonight she would finish" / "she meant to coax one out before dawn" restate intent. Minor template cadence in the opening third (subject, predicate, subordinate clause). Information density is strong; momentum adequate but not propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose carries strong imagery (flour whitening hair like frost, frozen waterfalls of memory) but accumulates metaphorical density that occasionally obscures rather than sharpens. Template cadence appears in several beats: "She descended... She dreamed... She woke... She spent... She set down... She picked up..." creating mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loops are minimal but present: the cataloguing/preserving distinction is restated multiple times. Information density is generally high; most lines advance situation or atmosphere. The line "pollinated by the busy hands of children who had learned that art was not a luxury but a lifeboat" stacks metaphors to strain coherence. Opening and closing images are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose carries figurative density ("tower's hollow throat exhaled dust," "lighthouse became an hourglass dripping in reverse") that often obscures rather than clarifies action in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "stepped beyond fate's design" recurs three times without added pressure; "slow exhale of low tide" appears identically twice. Template cadence: "he touched… he sat… he tied… he stepped" structures consecutive beats mechanically. The final third sustains clarity, but earlier beats suffer from synonym churn ("latent radiance" × 4) and mixed metaphors (hunger stone "pulse" vs. "ember eating the string"). Information density is moderate; several lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and largely coherent, but several metaphors strain: "fear had a throat" is functional, but "unbosom the memory" and "words clogged like sawdust" compete for register space. The opening's "resuscitation sirens fading…like a half-remembered lullaby" is evocative but introduces a simile that doesn't recur or deepen. Paraphrase appears in adjacent beats: the advisor "urged me to unbosom" is followed by "words clogged," restating resistance. Template cadence is minimal, but the accumulation of metaphor in most sentences ("jeweled beneath headlights," "tongue of mildewed velvet," "skewering the image") risks density without propulsion in the middle third. Information is layered rather than advanced in some beats. Rhythm modulates well at closure, but mid-story figurative stacking slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("clouds moved in slow arpeggios," "fractal generating," "restless euphony") and occasionally muddles under its own weight: "fractal generating, each echo birthing a smaller echo" stacks abstraction without grounding the mechanic in observable detail. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("He looped the creak... the wet slap... the soft thud") and the final paragraph recycles "He heard..." three times in close succession. Information density is strong when concrete (mallet wrapped in drumfish skin, bamboo crown) but dips into repetition of the resonance/echo/loop concept. No paraphrase loops mar closure, but the accumulated figurative load across the piece prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance multiple jobs (e.g., "she flipped open her spiral-shell atlas, each chamber a pressed map, and compared the tremor's rhythm to the pattern languages encoded in her mother's final log"). Clarity remains strong through complex action. However, the opening sentence runs long with multiple clauses that slightly obscure the anchor ("listening for the gate that had rusted shut" reads as an odd sensory construction). A few constructions edge toward overwriting: "heat-shivered mirages, robed in dust the color of old blood" stacks modifiers without added pressure. The phrase "sunwashed dread" recurs three times, crossing from motif into minor loop territory. No major artifacts, but density occasionally tips into decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Three distinct artifacts lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in the backstory block ("praised…until correspondence revealed" restated as "lived to rescue truth from the pit"), (2) template cadence in the penultimate paragraph ("scholars would argue, citizens would doubt, ministers would curse"), and (3) stock metaphor strings ("pit of lies," "noble lies," "sanctioned history") clustering without fresh texture. The loop and template trigger −0.6 baseline; the metaphor stack adds −0.3, totaling −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere and ritual. However, figurative language saturates many lines without consistent payoff: "blaze so hushed it burned only in the mind," "anxious tessellations," "bittersweet lozenge," "thread made of light" cluster in the middle third, creating ornamental drag. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the metaphor stack in high-pressure beats (the dome scene) applies −0.5. Sentence openings vary, spatial choreography is clean, and the final line recharges the opening image economically. Grammar and tense are consistent; pronoun references clear.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats (stamp application, card sorting, phosphorescent revelation). However, several ornamental phrases slow momentum: "slow applause," "dappled resolve—light and shadow alternating inside her like breathing," "tentatively perceptive" wrist mark repeated without added meaning. Minor paraphrase loop: "reclaimed stillness" appears three times with slight variation but no escalation. Stock metaphor "kelp forests and reading tables into coral reefs" is vivid but generic. No causality breaks; scaffold is minimal. Elevated diction in peak beats ("tranquilly perceptive") drifts from Mara's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines advance ritual action, world logic, or emotional state. Opening and closing images anchor voice and reweight prior material (kerosene→tea). However, several beats show figurative overload without clear payoff: "translucent ribs holding a galaxy of unfinished bedtime stories" and "each bead a syllable of her daughter's laugh caught in perpetual echo" pile metaphor without sharpening sense. Template cadence appears in the folding sequence: "each crease was a day...each tuck a promise" reads mechanical. Minor filter-verb stack: "she breathed...drew...began" in the ritual beat. These artifacts dull propulsion in high-pressure moments but do not obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and figurative language (geode as second heart, atoms mingling, potential pooling) charges key images. However, overwriting density appears: most sentences in the middle third carry layered metaphor without pattern-teaching, and mixed vehicles strain coherence ("perturbation I'd become," "death's accountant," "grave robber of possibility" cluster within three paragraphs). Template cadence surfaces in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openings. Two paraphrase loops: paragraphs 12–13 restate that he's collecting potential; paragraphs 18–19 circle the geode's final fragment showing his own unused future. Deduct −0.8 for density and loops; −0.3 for template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with vivid images ("star-shadows," "captured lightning," "waking beast"). Sentence rhythm varies, and paragraph cuts create visual breathing room. However, scaffold artifacts appear: "perpetually surprised eyes" recurs four times without variation, "brilliant dimness" is used twice as a stock descriptor, and paraphrase loops weaken density—"eyes that held galaxies" near the opening is echoed by "his surprised eyes" in later beats without adding pressure. The phrase "perpetually surprised" becomes a tic rather than a functional detail, and the final paragraph summarizes closure ("following their trails home") rather than landing on a concrete image with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"sky holds its breath," "family trees grafted from air," "sieved hush poured over the raw wound"—with some vehicles (ship masts as whale ribs, watch hand as dismembered time) doing double thematic work. However, stacked metaphors in the opening beat and "second heart that had learned to beat true" near closure verge on overwriting without pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase loop: "manufactured false memories" / "manufacturing coats of arms" / "manufactured the memory." Propulsion remains steady; no scaffolding detected. Information density is strong in the grandfather backstory integration.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language saturates the prose: "coat heavy with salt and regret," "bruised dawn," "leviathan corroded by centuries of impatient hands," "mistakes fermented," "moon's secret pulse," "squid grief," "moon slipping into the west, thinning to a blade." In high-pressure beats (the guards lowering spears, the rope-casting, the final exchange), the metaphors continue without pattern-teaching, creating ornamental density rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "the parapet waited… indifferent yet altered" echoes "the parapet felt wider… expanded to make room"; "he carried that warmth downward" recaps the prior sentence's image. Several template stems recur: "He rubbed… He replied… He produced… He listened… He descended… He carried." These artifacts dull immediacy and trigger cumulative penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in action beats. However, significant overwriting in figurative language: "memories of voyages where she had chosen the safe channel instead of the true one, trading love for charts, wonder for certainty" stacks metaphors without adding pressure; "pain is just another form of percussion in the night's orchestra" forces elevated register during a crisis beat. Template cadence appears in the pole progression: "first pole light... second pole light... pole three and four... final pole." Minor paraphrase loop: the compass as "heart that had forgotten how to beat" is restated as instrument that "broken so she would stop consulting metal instead of marrow." These artifacts appear in the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally per rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high throughout; some metaphors are vivid ("bottled auroras," "paper lanterns"), others strained ("arterial storm drains" conflates metaphor without clear vehicle logic). Paraphrase loops appear: "a space where empathy could grow without applause" echoes prior "darkness felt courteous," and the closure paragraph recycles "delicately robust" from paragraph four. Template cadence in middle beats ("He crouched, rolled… instead of sinking, it orbited") and elevated register ("consent to fracture," "jaded wonder") reduce immediacy. Information density is high but clarity occasionally blurs under figurative load. No major causality breaks, so artifacts remain here.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is very high across most beats: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated image, creating sluggish momentum in the ritual sequence. Specific examples: "crying notes that cracked the night open like a pomegranate," "veins of starlight threading through her wrists," "bones hollowed, feathers budding where sorrow had lived"—beautiful but unrelenting, flattening sentence rhythm. Template stems recur: "I [verb]" openings cluster in the conjuration. The closure image (beak singing lullaby backward, permanent moon) is clear, but path there is overwritten. No paraphrase loops detected, but density without breathing room lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lyric and image-dense, with vivid constructions ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "cloudbound repentance," "grease outline that never completely washes out"). However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without clear pattern-teaching or escalation, risking ornamental density: "choking beauty," "cathedral of vapor and regret," "lightning bolt of memory." Template cadence appears in repetitive participial and past-tense stems across the middle third. The phrase "willingly perplexed" recurs mechanically without reweighting. Minor clarity issues: "unfasten" is used twice (once for strap, once metaphorically for grief) without clear connection, and the simultaneous laughing/weeping risks cliché. No loops or scaffolding, but the density flattens momentum in the descent sequence where urgency would benefit from leaner syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff (overwriting penalty −0.5). Mixed metaphors appear: "bruise in space" widens into "corridor of whispers," then the ship "slipped through... like a needle through silk"—vehicles shift without coherent logic. Paraphrase loops: "vast auditorium of light where every photograph had become a living moment. Here the weddings danced, the birthdays laughed..." restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the catalogue beats ("the never-born children, the war-makers, the suicided Earth") flattens momentum (−0.4). Several beats summarize pivotal transformation (the sail unfolds, Tear dissolves, ship blooms) rather than dramatizing with concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy density of figurative language throughout ("bottled constellations," "universe lean closer," "viscous glow that tasted of salt and metamorphosis") creates lush texture but slows momentum and risks mixed metaphor (tasting glow, whispering shards). Paraphrase loops appear: "transformation was not a threshold but a medium" is restated in the final paragraph as "texture of transformation feels like glass warming into skin." Template cadence runs in the middle ("They descended together, no longer detouring but arriving, and every step left..."). These artifacts cluster across multiple beats, triggering −0.9 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense—"sky-barges tugged their anchors taut, then slack, then free," "thin kites snagging on surprise"—but the metaphoric load approaches overwriting in high-pressure beats (the keep door "sighed open, a lover's exhale" during the climax; "tongues of the same silent flame"). Mixed metaphors appear: "cradle of sparks" is cradled again inside the machine, recycling the vehicle without fresh tension. Template cadence emerges in the closing paragraph: "banners hanging neutral," "gates yawning toward a horizon," "the last winking hush settle into history"—parallel constructions that flatten propulsion. Paraphrase loop between "the cradle of sparks inside her chest" and "the cradle of sparks expand beyond her ribs" restates without added pressure. Information density is high, but some lines ("sentiment itself had swallowed their sparks") obscure more than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, but coherence suffers: "aurora above the tidal bluff shimmered like a borrowed dawn" mixes temporal metaphor with visual effect without clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "understand the sacred patterns" / "sacred patterns weren't meant to be understood" / "patterns consume their creators" across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the rock-placement sequence: "He began with the first rock... The second rock followed... The ninth rock clicked into place," a mechanical stem pattern across three beats. Stock phrasing ("slick skin," "crystalline moment," "essence becoming part of") and therapy-speak ("surrendered to") dull immediacy. Mixed metaphors: eels "slipped away the moment the laws changed, their sinuous bodies no longer bound to the water's resistance"—if friction vanished, all resistance vanishes, yet eels are described as unbound only from water. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (setting + concept), but scaffolding remains ("He understood then," "he knew"). Artifacts touch closure: the final constellation and Mira's voice return without prior on-page setup that this would be the form of closure, reading as asserted rather than earned. Apply −1.0 for paraphrase loops and template cadence runs, and −0.4 for mixed metaphor at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or symbol, but figurative language saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching or payoff sufficient to justify the load. Mixed metaphors appear: "sky archive," "ghost moon pulling tides of ink," "broadcast for anyone willing to listen to static" stack without clear vehicle coherence. Template cadence emerges in the darkroom sequence ("She set…," "She slipped…," "She opened…," "She stepped…"). Paraphrase loop: "furiously tranquil" and "a vigil in pause" repeat across three beats without added meaning. Clarity holds at closure, so penalties remain moderate, but the overwriting flattens propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence variety is present, but scaffold and paraphrase loops accumulate: "They had once co-authored… but split" restates rivalry already shown; "the dignified chaos of their duel still humming" recaps without new image. The final third stacks "-ing" participles and template cadence ("They walked… They stepped… the brook carried"). Figurative density ("blade not yet drawn," "silver raft," "shared melody") in adjacent lines blurs rather than sharpens. Apply −0.7 for loops and template runs touching the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"skin splits," "flames bloom green," "voices braid," "wings where definitions nested"—creating lyric texture but occasionally obscuring causality (how exactly does the false bottom "click"? why do flames bloom green?). Paraphrase loops appear: "the library feels jurisdiction-less, a sovereign gap" restates the same idea. Template cadence emerges in the final third: "They seal… No bulldozer will arrive… Lark will return… Together they will rebuild…" runs four parallel future constructions. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering a −0.8 deduction and disqualifying 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is otherwise strong, with most lines advancing action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence of the middle section: "tidal arbor," "cumulus pillows," "sprocket holes rimmed with moonlight," "flag that has forgotten its country." Many are evocative but a few contradict (cloud-roots "tugging downward" while the arbor is already "above the clouds") or blur spatial logic. Template cadence appears in runs: "She understood then that…," "She realized she could…," "The last thing…was her silhouette…" Stack of -ing participles and passive constructions ("was not escape but rehearsal," "was editing") flatten propulsion in the middle third. Paraphrase loops: "the clock strapped to her back" / "the clock…now part of the scene's architecture" / "the clock ticking audibly in her arms" recycle the image without added pressure. Information density is uneven—some lines do double work, others repeat concepts. No major causality breaks, so artifacts remain in Q7, but they cluster enough to disallow 9+ globally and pull the score below 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and often vivid ("dragon's back," "moonlit fish," "wave eroding hesitation"), but clusters of abstract constructions in peak beats reduce immediacy: "empirically whimsical tug between duty and self," "luminous uncertainty binds stronger than blind belief." Template cadence appears in the final third: multiple sentences open with "The [noun] [verb]" or "Calyx [verb]." Paraphrase loop: "she pressed the seed…watering it with the sound of her teacher's laughter that she would soon forget" immediately followed by "The seed split…" without added pressure. Information density is strong in the first half but the ending over-explains. Apply −0.8 for combined figurative muddle and template runs touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and the opening/closing images frame well, but multiple lines carry figurative density without pattern-payoff: "breathing sculptures," "voice slow as sap," "needles in slow piano notes," "clouds cleared...scent that carried the ghost ship itself across the horizon of mind." The final clause ("guiding no ships, only the quiet return...") stacks abstractions where a single concrete image would land harder. No paraphrase loops, but template cadence appears in the instruction beats ("First instruction...Second instruction...Final instruction") without variation. Information density is high; no scaffolding.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme), and maintain clarity despite conceptual density. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and grounded; images like “proof that growth and decay are not opposites but dance partners” and “a miniature galaxy in decay” are apt extensions of her worldview. There is some risk of over-saturation in the last paragraphs where abstractions cluster, but it doesn’t significantly muddy sense or stall momentum. Trimming one or two explicitly thesis-like lines would heighten impact, but as-is the prose is well above market-average.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (image, emotion, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and there is effective rhythmic variation across the piece. Figurative language is abundant but largely coherent and motif-linked (glass, fire, frost, breath), avoiding mixed metaphors or nonsense physics. A demanding editor might trim a handful of densely stacked modifiers (“air so cold it rang,” “drifting resonance,” “molten light”) to keep pressure from diffusing into pure texture, but clarity and momentum remain intact. There are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or technical stumbles that blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. The piece verges on metaphor saturation—nearly every sentence has figurative language—which occasionally risks purple-ness but rarely muddies meaning. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; most lines push forward or deepen texture. A touch more restraint in imagery would sharpen peak beats further, but current execution is already publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for image and meaning (“fire translated grief into light the way a prism translates sun into rainbow”). Metaphors remain internally consistent and thematically aligned (books, light, debt, cataloging), avoiding mixed or decorative comparisons. There’s minimal redundancy, and the paragraphing supports a smooth build toward the climax and quiet denouement. The few repeated phrases (“occupying impossible spaces,” “chased stillness”) feel like deliberate leitmotifs rather than scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and largely free of scaffold or redundancy, with most doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; metaphors like “amplified quiet” and “smooth as a tear” stay within the story’s acoustic and tactile logic. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic templates, or clarity issues even in the more ornate passages. The prose is lush but earns its texture by continuously advancing momentum and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for image and emotion (“thick, foggy lucidity,” “each breath she took tasted purple”). There are occasional tilts toward purple prose and stacked metaphors—nearly every line carries a figurative load—which could be pruned for even greater impact and momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained through the climax and closing images; cause and effect are never obscured by the lyric surface. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and the final images (red silk as flag, transparent breath) land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is rich, with high information density and images that usually do multiple jobs (e.g., bark as photographic paper, rings as film and tree-years at once). Rhythm varies, and almost every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or internal turn. At times, figurative layering approaches overload, flirting with purple without quite tipping into opacity; a few metaphors could be pared for even greater sharpness. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved through the climax, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and musical, with varied syntax and high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, character). Imagery is often striking and coherent (“bass drum striking midnight,” “parade ribbon” chain), and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The main weakness is occasional near-purple saturation: similes stack up and some phrases (“staggeringly graceful moment”) tell what the surrounding images already show. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact throughout, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, but most metaphors are coherent with the world’s logic (auroras bleeding, kiln coals as bruised notes, fragrance sounding like forgiveness) and multitask to develop mood, world, and theme. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence carries new information or pressure. The risk of purple prose is high at this density, yet the piece largely avoids muddle, with only a couple of slightly abstract formulations that could be trimmed without harming meaning. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum through the central forge sequence into a clean, charged ending.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is polished: images are vivid, sentences vary in rhythm, and most metaphors cohere and pull double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “jar heavier by one reconciliation”). There is a high density of figurative language, but it’s mostly well-chosen and pattern-consistent (light, photography, florals) rather than random ornament. Redundancy is minimal, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lushness. For a top-tier venue, a few lines could be pared or sharpened to let key moments breathe, but there are no significant artifacts or muddled images undermining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is dense and musical, with most sentences doing double duty for image and emotion (“steam rose, carrying the ghostly smell of cardamom...”) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned (ice as armies, tape as snakeskins, dome as map/skull), and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. There is a slight risk of saturation—nearly every line is “on,” which can blur peaks and valleys—but clarity and propulsion remain intact. With a few strategic plainer beats to let key images breathe, this could push into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images do multiple jobs, syntax varies, and most sentences carry both atmosphere and character. Metaphor density is high but generally controlled and coherent with the cinematic milieu; a few phrases (“dawn bruised the horizon,” “constellations clogged”) verge on familiar or lush yet do not impede clarity. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences, and the closure image (stars as “unpaid extras” watching his fear) reads clean. Slight purple-fringe moments keep it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening character, and enriching imagery simultaneously. Metaphors are generally coherent and on-theme (silence as cartography, thunder as a trapped insect in amber), and there are few if any mixed or confusing images. A handful of lines edge toward overload (“a living hush folded small enough to tuck inside the last heartbeat of the world”), which might slightly blunt impact in a top-tier venue. Nonetheless, rhythm is varied, transitions are clear, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically smooth, with some striking lines (“a sound like wind chimes made of memory,” “the moment before creation, mundane and mystical simultaneously”). Information density is good; nearly every sentence supports atmosphere, concept, or character. There is mild redundancy and conceptual echoing (repeated explanations of the Program’s purpose and the loop’s effect on consciousness), which slightly dulls momentum and could be cut for tightness. Figurative language stays coherent and not over-stacked, but the closing paragraphs verge on summary/statement rather than dramatized image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and do multiple jobs, and the story sustains an appealing, controlled lyricism. Images like the ticket “glowed on her ledger like a wound” and the forecourt feeling “larger, as though the rain had washed the walls farther apart” are striking without obscuring sense. There is some accumulation of metaphors (“funeral march for resentment,” “ambiguously clear weight of trust”) that nudge toward purple but do not derail clarity or momentum. No obvious loops or scaffolding clutter the prose, and rhythm tracks the scene’s emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, dense with meaning, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; metaphors (e.g., blooms as “forgotten promises,” marbles as broken constellations) are coherent and controlled. Sentences vary in length and cadence, sustaining momentum despite the reflective mode. Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels purple or muddled, and the closure image with the glove and marbles lands cleanly. The only restraint at this level is occasional slight over-saturation of lyrical phrasing that softens edge and urgency; a few plainer beats might sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and concept at once). Metaphors (station as chrysalis, choices as wings, time as a paper fan) are coherent with each other and with the world, and they pay off thematically at the end. There’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is sustained despite the lyricism. It borders on lush, but never quite tips into muddle or purple excess in the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with strong images like the ghost’s dress “floating around her like a jellyfish” and musical notes becoming fish. Line-level clarity is high; each sentence advances either atmosphere or narrative, and there are few obvious redundancies. However, there’s some conceptual repetition around “between-spaces,” transformation, and being “unsung,” which could be sharpened or compressed. A handful of lines slide into abstraction and theme-summary rather than concrete scene work, slightly dulling momentum near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and worldbuilding at once), and rhythm varies with pressure. Figurative language is generally fresh and coherent; metaphors like “the ceiling boards flexing like lungs” and “auroral sorrow” deepen rather than confuse. There is mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence is metaphorically charged—which edges toward purple but stays on the readable side. Momentum holds through to closure with no obvious scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled: metaphors are coherent and motif-linked (“like damp wool,” “like mercury or guilt”) rather than decorative noise. Sentence rhythm varies, and nearly every line does multiple jobs—advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously—without evident scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The final third remains clear despite lyricism, and the closure image (“no longer lead but brass—recorded, balanced, and…bearable”) is sharp rather than muddled. There are no grammatical or sequencing errors that impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are rhythmic, imagery is often striking, and most lines carry multiple functions (setting, mood, theme) without obvious scaffolding. There is some repetition and density that nudge toward excess—e.g., reusing “across the drift of untold seasons” and “catacombs of lost knowledge,” and occasionally stacking metaphors—but clarity remains intact and the closure image is sharp. Trimming a few near-duplicate phrases would sharpen momentum and further elevate already strong prose.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level writing is dense, musical, and generally very clear—most sentences do two or more jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without feeling redundant. Figurative language is frequent but largely apt, and images rarely blur sense or contradict one another. There is mild risk of overrichness in places, yet momentum and clarity survive intact through the climax and closure. With a touch more spareness at one or two descriptive peaks, it could push into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but generally precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) without slack. Figurative language is dense yet coherent and thematically unified (axes, doors, embers, wings), avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. Momentum is maintained despite lyricism; each paragraph advances situation or pressure rather than looping. A very few lines (“bronze quiet,” “final human dream”) verge on being reused aesthetic tags, but they still earn their keep by charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty with image and action (“white explosions that looked like negatives developing in a tray”). Metaphoric language is frequent but largely coherent and on-theme, and there are few if any outright scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The prose propels rather than bogs, even in reflective moments, and the final image neatly reactivates earlier diction (“key,” “open secret,” “spine of the island”). The one drag on a higher score is the sheer density of figurative equivalences, which occasionally risks feeling ornamental rather than strictly necessary to advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and image) and the rhythm varies in a controlled way that suits the ritualistic tone. Metaphors are generally apt and striking, and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy. However, the sheer saturation of figurative language leaves almost no plain surface, which occasionally edges toward purple and risks muting individual images’ impact. Even so, clarity of action and closure is preserved, and the prose remains impressive by elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs at once, images are mostly precise, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and thematically unified around music, shells, glass, and reflection. At times, the accumulation of metaphors per sentence risks saturation, slightly blurring impact and giving a faint sense of purple excess. Nonetheless, causality and closure remain clear, and the final images (shell crumbling to sand, bubbles thawing into music) land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is dense and inventive—few sentences are doing only one job, and images like “wallpaper peeling like sunburned skin” or “eyes two black moons absorbing light” are fresh and precise. Despite heavy metaphorical load, the prose remains legible and causality clear, with minimal redundancy or scaffold. There are moments where figurative language stacks (“darkening brightness,” “cathedral bones,” “birds of fired clay”) verge on saturation, risking slight sensory fatigue. Still, rhythm, clarity, and momentum are well managed, and no significant loops or artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but largely precise, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion (“Vibrations traveled through the machine, through the bench, through the packed-earth floor, entering the bones of her ankles like a shy knock”). Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned with sound, touch, and reversal; they rarely feel mixed or gratuitous. A few lines verge on over-explanation or prettiness (e.g., explicitly glossing numbness as “only silence waiting to be spun backward into song”), but they do not significantly drag momentum or blur sense. Rhythm and sentence variety support the slow-building pressure and quiet climax without noticeable scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and story, and the rhythm varies intelligently to match beats. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (storms, grids, breathing earth), never truly purple or muddled. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences; action and thought remain clear even in lyric stretches. A few metaphors and abstract phrasings (“integrity depends on solitude,” “layered tranquility”) flirt with conceptual generality, keeping this short of the absolute top echelon but still at a publishable high level.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double or triple duty, and the imagery is inventive yet legible (“a cathedral of invisible colors,” “pulsed like a memory discovering it was still alive”). The prose sustains a rich metaphorical density without collapsing into mush or contradiction, and syntactic variety keeps momentum. A few phrases recur a bit conspicuously (“ultraviolet revealing panels,” “aromatically cautious”), and one or two insights are told where image alone might suffice, but these are minor. There are no real loops, artifacts, or clarity stumbles, including in the closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, most metaphors are clean, and there’s high information density with minimal scaffolding. Recurrent images (rope, starlight, clay) are reused purposefully, not as empty repetition. A few phrases (“texture of time,” “impossible choices”) recur enough to edge toward on-the-nose, but they don’t seriously blur clarity or momentum. There’s no major figurative muddle or syntactic artifact dragging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are dense yet purposeful, with images doing multiple jobs (e.g., “the sky still wore the color of old pennies” evokes color, age, and economic echo). Figurative language is frequent but coherent; metaphors (music, breath, fire, drowning) are thematically aligned and don’t conflict. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm shifts naturally between longer, lyric lines and shorter emphatic ones. The final paragraphs, in particular, achieve a clean, resonant cadence without clutter or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and figurative language is vivid yet mostly disciplined. Images like “The scent bloomed like a bruise—honeyed regret, sharp with the citrus of almost-joy” exemplify the density and precision. There’s little redundancy or looped phrasing, and rhythm varies effectively through the scene. The prose occasionally leans lush, but it doesn’t tip into muddle or stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense yet mostly efficient, with many sentences doing triple duty in atmosphere, character, and theme (“card catalog drawers like gull wings,” “sleeping gulls, exchanging stories without surnames”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and pattern-consistent, supporting the accumulative, lyrical mode without tipping into full purple prose. There’s minimal redundancy and no major scaffold or loop artifacts; the closing images land clearly. The only deduction is for occasional over-rich stacking of metaphors and explicit thematic restatements that slightly slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and motion) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and imagery is fresh more often than not. The prose leans lush and metaphorical, but the density is controlled enough that clarity is rarely threatened, and crucial beats (touching the tag, exhaling the glyph, orchard flaring) are rendered straightforwardly. There’s some lexical recurrence (“ache,” “beyond the murmur of lost languages,” “luminescent”) that brushes against purple but largely feels motif-driven rather than padded. Overall momentum is well maintained for a lyric piece with no major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and syntactic variation that keeps the paragraph flow alive. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and precise; images like ripples “climbing backward like silverfish” or clock hands as cage bars feel apt and legible. The prose occasionally flirts with over-richness, with metaphor layered on metaphor, but it does not materially obscure causality or the closure image. There are no evident loops, redundancies, or technical errors to sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, multi-functional, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but coherent and patterned; the math and carpentry metaphors (dovetailing, coefficients, limits) interlock rather than clash. A few lines come close to conceptual overstatement, yet they don’t obscure action or closure. Momentum remains intact from start to finish, with no paragraphs that could be removed without loss of charge or information.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without padding, and the rhythm suits the hushed, accumulative mode. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful, rarely feeling purple; key metaphors (bloodlike oxide, moth-wing lullaby, constellation of voices) are coherent and thematically aligned. Repetition of certain phrases (“sapphire hush,” “cached”) functions as motif rather than scaffolding. A handful of slightly lush moments could be tightened, but they do not materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, and theme) with minimal redundancy, and the imagery is generally controlled and apt. There are a few close repetitions (“circuitously sincere,” “transformation,” explicit theme language) and occasional near-purple moments, but they do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum. The prose sustains a high figurative density without collapsing into mixed metaphors. Slight trimming of explanatory lines would sharpen the already vivid closure images.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are varied, images concrete, and many lines do double duty advancing world, mood, and character. Descriptions such as the monastery “emerged from the receding tide like a broken tooth” and frescoes “bubbled and peeled” are vivid without confusion. There is some repetition of key phrases (“thresh meaning from experience,” “water wars,” “unearthed convergence”) and a slight tilt toward purple, but it rarely derails clarity or momentum. Trimming a few abstractions and redundancies would sharpen an already high level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and imagistic, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs of worldbuilding, mood, and thematic set-up. There is some risk of overload: figurative language is near-constant, and terms like “steadily unpredictable,” “bright darkness,” and “overlapping shadows” recur with slight conceptual redundancy. Nonetheless, clarity of cause and effect is preserved, and key beats (the ritual, transfer, and vanishing entrance) remain vivid and legible. A firm edit could trim a bit of purple flourish, but no major artifacts or loops undermine momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs of setting, characterization, and theme. Metaphoric language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent, with only occasional risk of piling images (e.g., blood/ scar tissue ink) close together. Rhythm varies well, and the final line is an excellent cadence that recharges earlier motifs. The heavy reliance on metaphor edges toward purple at moments, but it doesn’t materially obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are dense with meaning, multi-functional, and rhythmically controlled, and there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. However, the figurative load is extremely high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated image—which occasionally feels like saturation rather than escalation (“the hour that divides bad habits and new starts” plus “mountain’s starlit throat,” etc.). The repeated phrase “the cracks in pavement forming arrows” shows some motif-intent but verges on overuse. Despite this mild purple tendency, clarity remains intact and the closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, with many lines doing double work for setting, theme, and emotion (“its brass tube rang against stone like a church bell calling the faithful to doubt”). Metaphor chains are mostly coherent and on-theme (music, migration, tuning, parchment) and avoid feeling random or overwrought, though the density flirts with purple in places. Momentum holds despite the lyricism; there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition, and syntax and paragraphing support a smooth read. The slight risk is that nearly every sentence reaches for figurative language, which can blur edge and impact a bit, but clarity and cadence remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient, with many lines doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood plus character). Figurative language is inventive and mostly coherent, and sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum through a lyric, concept-heavy piece. There are a few spots where metaphor stacks (“hush between thunder and echo,” “hushed thunder,” “footfalls sounded like distant thunder muffled under velvet”) verge on over-similarity and could be pared for maximum impact. Nonetheless, clarity holds and the final images land cleanly without syntactic or logical muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing double duty (atmosphere plus character plus theme). Figurative language is fresh and coherent, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum; there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Information is delivered economically—political backstory, magic rules, and emotional stakes are folded into active lines rather than explained didactically. A few metaphors verge on richness (“iron and thunder,” “liquefy every rigid story”) but never tip into muddle or stall the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is rich and efficient: most sentences do more than one job—worldbuilding, character, and theme often coincide in a single metaphor. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony despite a consistently ornate style, and causality remains clear even in dense figurative passages. There is mild overwriting in places (nearly every line in some stretches carries a simile or metaphor), which could fatigue some readers at scale, but it rarely muddies sense or momentum. No major scaffolding, repetition loops, or mixed metaphors interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is dense and purposeful: most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphor use is frequent but controlled and internally coherent (containers as canyons, labels as moths, memories as tin sheets), and the rhythm shifts appropriately between long, sinuous lines and shorter beats at key turns. There are almost no paraphrase loops or template cadences, and grammar/usage are clean. The occasional abstract phrase (“recalcitrant histories,” “sterile memory”) slightly dulls immediacy, but the closure image itself is sharp and unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is rich and image-dense but largely avoids true purple excess; most metaphors do at least double duty (e.g., “night had finished closing the horizon’s book; stars clicked into place like punctuation marks” ties time, setting, and theme). Sentence rhythm varies nicely, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line adds new information or pressure. Figurative language remains coherent—spirals, pages, tides, sounds—and doesn’t contradict itself or blur sense. The only limitation is that density occasionally risks slight over-saturation, though it never quite stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level writing is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and maintain momentum, and figurative language is inventive without usually tipping into purple. A few moments flirt with overload or tonal hiccup (the sudden Chinese “投射的火花” in an otherwise English passage, and density of metaphor in the opening) but they don’t obscure sense or closure. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final paragraph is crisp and resonant. Overall, it’s polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and figurative language that is inventive yet coherent (“casting shadows of vanished oceans,” “letters never meant to be mailed”). Repetition (e.g., “purposefully curious,” returns to hourglass/sand/grain) functions as motif rather than looped padding. The prose sometimes approaches maximal lushness, but it doesn’t tip into muddle or contradict itself, and momentum through the scene is well maintained. No noticeable grammatical or clarity issues interfere with causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and images that typically do two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with only minor risk of piling (“copper bleeding into violet,” “second heart that had forgotten its rhythm”) before a beat feels over-decorated. The prose maintains clarity under pressure, especially around the technical steps of diagnosis, patching, and retraining. I see no real scaffold, redundancy, or grammatical noise that would obstruct momentum or muddle closure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line by line, the prose is remarkably clean and economical given its density of image—most sentences carry at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus character or theme). Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“lake stretched like a shattered mirror,” “shaft… walls ribbed like throat cartilage”) and rarely feel strained; there’s no evident synonym churn or scaffolding. Momentum is maintained even through descriptive passages, with no obvious loops or redundant restatements. The closure images are crisp and legible, with the frost spiral and quiet lake delivering a precise, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, layered images, and sentences that generally do more than one job. A few metaphors verge on purple or pile up (e.g., “moonlight tastes on the tongue of a sleepwalker”) but they rarely confuse sense or stall momentum. There’s little paraphrase looping or scaffolding; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes. The density is near the upper limit for an elite venue but remains largely under control.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is dense but purposeful: most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing action while building atmosphere or theme) without obvious redundancy or scaffold. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent within a consistent register (radio notes, glassfish memories, lilac stars), avoiding mixed metaphors that blur sense. Rhythm varies and supports momentum; even long sentences maintain clarity, and the climactic beats (“She uncorked…”, “The lilac drop drifted out…”) are sharply framed. There are no evident syntactic loops, filter-verb stacks, or mechanical artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but mostly does multi-duty: images carry atmosphere, worldbuilding, and theme at once (e.g., coral sustaining color after death as a metaphor for impossible architecture and lingering lies). Sentences vary in length and cadence, supporting a hypnotic but forward-moving rhythm; there is little true scaffolding or paraphrased repetition. Figurative language is frequent yet largely coherent and apt, with only a few moments skirting purple or piling metaphors (“wolf made entirely of withheld truth,” “communion-wine fog”) without loss of clarity. Overall, information density and line-level control are strong enough for elite venues, though a demanding editor might trim a handful of metaphors to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level writing is dense but generally efficient; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without redundancy. Repeated phrases like “resonant awakening” and “lovingly venomous” work as purposeful leitmotifs rather than evidence of looped phrasing. Metaphors remain coherent and grounded in the established imagery of cold, metal, fruit, and light, avoiding mixed or strained comparisons. A few sentences edge toward purple, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image, so the piece retains strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, theme, and motion), and there’s little true redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and legible, and key causal beats (surrender, sewing, blood, sea’s return) are never obscured by metaphor. A few images tip toward purple or pile density (“optimism sharp enough to haunt the dead,” “labyrinth exhaled centuries of salt”), which may slightly blunt immediacy for some readers. Overall, though, momentum is maintained and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense yet generally clear, often doing double duty for atmosphere and advancement, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors around roots, bones, and shadows maintain a coherent field, and crucial actions (the shadow rebuilding the chapel, the bell tower ringing without a tongue) remain lucid. A few spots flirt with over-saturation (“cautious enchantment thick as honey around her tongue,” “blossoms opened in colors that had no names”), which may feel slightly purple at elite-literary strictness but don’t materially blur causality or the closure image. Overall, the prose propels rather than stalls, just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with metaphors that are coherent and thematically aligned. The prose sustains a high level of lyricism without tipping into full purple; most images do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion/theme). There is some repetition and formula (“codes in children's sidewalk chalk” appears multiple times verbatim), but it reads more as motif than scaffolding, only mildly blunting momentum. No significant artifacts or clarity issues interfere with the closure image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, musical, and multi-tasking—almost every sentence advances world, character, and theme simultaneously. Repetition is largely functional, but a few phrases (“flame from eternal candle”) edge toward incantatory overuse and risk slight heaviness. There’s no real scaffolding or synonym churn; rhythm and line length modulate nicely with scene pressure. Clarity and momentum hold throughout despite the high figurative load, keeping this just shy of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: most sentences do double or triple duty (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) with minimal fat. Figurative language is dense but rarely muddled; recurring images (moonlight, water, mouths/lungs) form a coherent system rather than a grab bag. Rhythm varies purposefully, with long sinuous lines balanced by clipped, pivotal ones (“‘I’m sorry,’ I said, and the words did not echo; they seeded.”). There is little evidence of scaffold or redundancy, and the closure image is sharp rather than obscured by purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush, with high information density and many lines doing double duty for image and theme (“each drop a syllable I had failed to interpret in time”). Rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence adds a new facet. The figurative language is dense enough that it occasionally edges toward overload, but metaphors are mostly coherent, not mixed, and the through-lines (reef, ink, droplets, shrapnel/sediment) keep it grounded. Copy is clean and sequence clear, with a strong, earned final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with image yet generally clear, and most metaphors reinforce a cohesive visual/thematic palette rather than piling up randomly. There’s good syntactic variety and little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every line is doing multiple jobs. The prose occasionally brushes purple (“fermented stars,” “daydream folded once more, sealing the orchard under its pewter quilt”), but these flourishes stay legible and don’t obscure causality or closure. The final beats read cleanly and with propulsion despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and information-dense; nearly every sentence advances image, world, or thematic frame without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined and coherent, building a unified sonic/visual motif rather than veering into muddle. Rhythm varies well across longer, baroque lines and shorter closures, giving the ending real cadence. A few phrases verge on decorative, but they don’t obscure sense or blunt the closure image, so the net effect supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense yet clear, with few if any scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding, tone, character). Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; the metaphors extend the tax and bureaucracy motif instead of feeling random, and there are no mixed-metaphor stumbles. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum, especially around Voss’s entrance and the escape sequence. The only arguable limitation is that the density of cleverness might, for some readers, edge toward saturation in a few adjacent lines, but it doesn’t impair clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“planetarium of his insomnia” is exemplary). Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent, building a unified marine/spiral/botanical lexicon rather than a grab bag of metaphors. A few moments edge toward over-saturation, risking slight fatigue, but they don’t significantly obscure causality or dull the closure beats. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum through what is essentially a single extended lyric scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and advance of action) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm is varied and musical. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and non-muddled; recurring images (glass-orchids, foxglove heart, bulbs, tube) build a pattern rather than a random metaphor soup. There’s a mild risk of purple prose due to how saturated every line is, and one could imagine trimming a few modifiers without loss, but clarity and momentum hold through closure. The final paragraphs, in particular, land with clean, charged images rather than abstract statements.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-by-line craft is dense but mostly purposeful: many sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) without obvious padding, and there are very few true redundancies. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent in its music/linguistics/ritual palette, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. Momentum holds across the piece; even reflective sentences are tightly anchored to present action or stakes. The only notable limitation is that the sustained high lyricism occasionally risks saturation, leaving less room for stark, plain phrasing that could sharpen moments of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world, character, theme) and there is very little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is abundant but largely controlled and coherent—the building breathing, the pattern trembling like a tuning fork, the chain as both tool and symbol—and rarely feels mixed. A few phrases (“dappled resolve” especially) are reused, but as intentional motif rather than loop. The density approaches purple but stops short of obscuring meaning or slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush but mostly precise, with lines doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) and very little slack or scaffolding. Rhythm varies well, and images like “rice paper and Chopin etudes” or “gum arabic in rainwater” are striking without being opaque. The main blemish is the duplicated phrase “learning to trust again across learning to trust again,” which reads as an artifact rather than purposeful repetition, and a couple of metaphors brush against purple. Overall, though, momentum and clarity remain high despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are vivid, metaphors largely coherent and specific, and most sentences carry multiple layers of information (world, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy. There is a dense figurative texture, but it is pattern-consistent rather than purple for its own sake. Momentum holds despite reflection because each descriptive move also advances decoding or reframes the central question. A few abstractions could be trimmed or grounded more concretely, yet they do not materially blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and musical, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing image, world, and emotional stance simultaneously. Figurative language is generally precise and thematically aligned (e.g., feathers as question marks, city as orrery), and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. However, the near-constant metaphorical load, especially in high-pressure beats, risks veering toward purple and occasionally blurs edges where a touch more plainness might heighten impact. Line-level control is strong, but the density just undercuts maximal clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, with metaphors that are generally clean and coherent (“her gloom felt cheerful, the way dawn sometimes smiles while burying the stars” is a standout). Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent with the piece’s lyric mode and rarely feels indulgent or redundant. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or clarity failures, and both opening and closing lines are charged and purposeful. The only restraint from an even higher score is occasional ornamentation that doesn’t quite add new pressure, but it doesn’t materially harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are information-dense, multi-functional, and rhythmically varied without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. Figurative language is frequent but not purple; imagery is precise and thematically aligned, seldom feeling strained or mixed. Transitions between cause-and-effect units are clear despite the lyric texture, so momentum holds from set-up through the cascading accident to the quiet epilogue at the slot machine. There is minimal fat to trim, and the final sentence lands as a clean, charged summation of prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is rich and dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent (e.g., “absence grew teeth,” “air tasted of obsidian grace”) and patterns are taught then reprised rather than piled randomly. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum is maintained despite high density. A few metaphors and abstractions sit near the edge of purple, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense yet mostly efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, character, and theme) without obvious redundancy, and the metaphors generally cohere with the glass/light/water system. Rhythm is varied, and line-level clarity remains high despite lyric density; the scene’s actions are easy to follow. There is some risk of over-ornamentation, with figurative language appearing in many consecutive sentences, which slightly blunts impact at this length. Still, there are no major loops or muddled metaphors, and the closure image is crisp and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for image, theme, and emotion; rhythm mostly supports momentum. However, figurative density is very high—metaphors in nearly every sentence (“fire writes in verbs too quick to read,” “moon kept polishing the granite,” etc.), which occasionally risks purple overload. Despite that, clarity and causality remain intact, and there are few if any true redundancies or scaffolding sentences. A slight trim or strategic plainness at peak beats would elevate this into truly elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, frequently doing double duty for atmosphere and concept, and most metaphors hold cleanly within the story’s dream-logic. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence is figurative—which may slightly blunt momentum in a venue that prizes sharp turns. Still, there are no major loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity breaks, and key beats (balloon descent, gauges chiming, final rearranged sentence) land crisply. Trimming a small handful of ornamental flourishes would likely elevate this to elite-line calibre.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but controlled; metaphors like “the university's east wing had become a lung of moss and dripping memory” and “film negative strip curled like a sleeping serpent” are vivid, apt, and not overstacked to the point of confusion. Line-level momentum is strong—nearly every sentence adds either image, concept, or forward motion with minimal scaffold or redundancy. The closing cadence (“mapping the dreams of stone, each glimpse revealing another layer of ivy over her own forgetting”) neatly threads concept and image without lapsing into pure abstraction. A few sentences are long and multi-clausal, but they retain clarity and don’t blur cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, vivid, and information-dense, often doing double-duty on atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few if any mixed metaphors, and key images (heartbeat, glass, rain, bells) repeat with fresh inflection rather than redundancy. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyric density. The very high metaphor frequency in some stretches edges toward purple, slightly dulling impact, which keeps this just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are clear, metaphors (“obsidian…veined with silver,” the clipboard turning into a cradle) are mostly fresh, and sentences often do multiple jobs at once. The piece avoids serious loops or syntactic scaffolding, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective tone. There is some mild purple tendency and conceptual repetition—particularly around redemption and peace—that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness. The final few lines veer into abstract summary rather than pure image, slightly dulling the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is highly figurative but avoids muddle: metaphors of cracks, wings, echo, and drought align into a coherent image system rather than clashing. Sentence-level density is high, yet each line does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) so momentum rarely stalls. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences; syntax is varied and reads smoothly aloud, with strong verbs and minimal flab. If anything, a demanding editor might trim a modifier or two, but nothing here obscures sense or dulls the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is rich and generally precise, with strong verbs and images doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once. There is some purple-leaning density (nearly every sentence in some passages carries a metaphor or sensory flourish), which mildly slows momentum in what is ostensibly a high-stakes ritual. Nonetheless, syntax varies, scaffolding is minimal, and the closure image is clear rather than muddied by figurative excess. The piece would likely benefit from a few strategic cuts, but it remains well above-average in craftsmanship.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often striking—“smoke curl into equations of regret,” “meteor hush,” “parchment‑like skin”—with good rhythmic variety and high information density. Most sentences do multiple jobs (image, theme, and motion at once), and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or loop artifacts. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, sometimes stacking metaphors in a way that risks feeling over‑ornate and occasionally blunting clarity or emotional sharpness. A touch more restraint or contrast in texture would elevate it to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are precise, often doing double duty for image and theme, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The figurative language (e.g., “caught in the gears of the town clock, a casualty of time’s mechanical hunger”) is mostly fresh and coherent, though cumulative lushness skirts purple in places. Rhythm varies nicely, and the prose maintains clarity even when dense. Minor over-insistence on certain phrasings (“blushing stillness,” “transiently rooted”) is noticeable but does not materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and largely successful: sentences are varied, information-dense, and frequently do double or triple duty (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme in one image). Metaphors like “map of negative stars” or “each name spoken by a different snowflake striking the skylight” are striking yet comprehensible, and the syntax maintains momentum. There is borderline overwriting—figurative language in nearly every line creates a constant high pitch—but the pattern is taught early and sustained with internal logic, so it reads as intentional style more than artifact. No significant loops or scaffolding dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and images that generally pull double duty for atmosphere and theme (“water and light pour in, carrying seeds that sprout before they land”). There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or abstraction—but coherence remains intact and there are few, if any, mixed or clashing images. The prose sustains momentum despite being lush, with clear logical sequencing from beat to beat. A touch more spareness at key pressure points could sharpen impact, but as-is it’s publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush, image-dense, and generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning. Recurrent phrases and motifs (“empirical irony,” “dusky harmony”) mostly feel intentional, though they edge toward over-insistence. Figurative language remains coherent and legible; there is little true scaffolding or synonym churn. At times the density slightly risks purple-prose saturation, but it does not materially blur the closure image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and targeted (“bricks of fear restacking,” “gunpowder residue lodged in spirit skin”), supporting both war imagery and the cellular-memory conceit. A couple of lines nudge toward overt cleverness or algebraic abstraction (“calculus of vengeance solved itself into zero”), but they do not significantly blur sense or stall momentum. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances image, concept, or emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and information-dense, often carrying character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, and there are no obvious metaphor clashes or paraphrase loops. Momentum holds; each line pushes either ritual, perception, or transformation forward, and the final image lands cleanly. The main drawback is a near-constant lushness—almost every sentence is highly ornamented—which risks slight reader fatigue and occasionally feels like aesthetic excess rather than pressure-bearing necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences multitask, imagery is often striking, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyric density, with transitions (“Word spread…”, “Years later…”) that efficiently carry us through time. Metaphoric richness is nearly continuous, which risks purple prose but generally remains coherent and in-voice; the text stops short of mixed-metaphor muddle. A bit more sparseness at peak beats (e.g., the first ritual, the elders’ arrival) could let the most powerful images hit even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, packed with information, and generally pull double duty on atmosphere and concept. The figurative density is high but mostly coherent, with recurring motifs (pages, grafting, orchards, doors) rather than scattered, competing metaphors. There are few if any scaffold or paraphrase loops, and causality remains intelligible despite the lyric style. At times the prose skirts purple—especially in clustered abstractions near the end—but it does not significantly blunt clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level writing is dense and imaginative, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (music, language, botany) and rarely feels mixed or confusing; “labyrinthine bookstore hummed, arranging its corridors into a new clef” exemplifies this control. A conventional editor might trim a few modifiers for air, but clarity is not compromised, and closure images land sharply. Grammar and mechanics are clean, with no artifacts that obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is excellent: high information density, minimal redundancy, and images that typically do two or three jobs at once. The prose approaches maximal lushness, but metaphors stay internally consistent and oriented around a few core vehicles (carnival, text/pages, gardens, threads). Rhythm varies, and the final paragraphs (ship bowing, lilies reading the coat) land with clarity and force. The only slight constraint is that the unrelenting figurative richness may mildly fatigue some readers in a market that prizes razor-edged concision.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the writing is highly crafted: images are fresh, concrete, and multi-tasking, and there’s little genuine redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, giving the piece a rich, incantatory texture that matches its ritual core. A few metaphors nudge toward purple (“orderly cannibalism of seconds,” “warm as fresh bread”) and the density risks saturation, but clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and ending. The final paragraphs in particular balance lyricism with clean information delivery, which keeps the closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, and action), and most metaphors are coherent with the sonic/mineral palette (“bridge of petrified song,” “mined from the wings of deaf crickets”). Rhythm varies, and there’s little outright scaffolding or repetition; information density is high without losing basic clarity. However, figurative language is nearly constant, occasionally tipping toward decorative excess that risks numbing impact (“footsteps, soft as hammered repose” plus several similar coinages in close succession). Tightening one or two of the more ornamental images, especially near the climax, would sharpen propulsion to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and most do double or triple duty (world, mood, and character at once). Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent; images build on established motifs of glass, light, and sound rather than wandering into mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the closure image is sharp and uncluttered. The only restraint on an even higher score is the sheer saturation of imagery, which at moments risks feeling a touch lush for readers who prefer more sparing metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, densely meaningful, and tend to do multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, and thematic charge at once). Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors cluster around a few coherent domains (archives, weather, mapping), avoiding mixed or strained comparisons. There’s very little scaffold or repetition, and information unfolds cleanly without clogging momentum. The final third, especially, lands precise, memorable images without purple excess, keeping the closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level is dense and imaginative, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are frequent but largely coherent and on-theme; images like the hourglass sand orbiting “like playful fireflies” and the fortress’s “stone petals” avoid mixed-vehicle confusion. There is some risk of over-lushness, but momentum is preserved and causality remains clear even in the most lyrical stretches. No significant loops, filter-verb stacks, or artifacty cadences interfere with the climax or closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but coherent, with recurring vehicles (throat, ribs, tide, cocoon) rather than scattered, mixed metaphors, and it does not impede clarity of action. There is a mild risk of purple prose in places (“the texture of time became the grit of salt on their lips”), but the piece has taught its lyric mode early, so the flourish reads earned rather than ornamental. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and momentum is well maintained despite reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences do multiple jobs at once, and figurative language is inventive yet usually precise (“planks yielded like memory… then firmed into certainty”). The prose maintains momentum despite density, with very little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances image, mood, or stakes. Metaphor saturation is high—almost every sentence is charged—which risks slight fatigue in a longer piece but remains coherent and legible here. No significant artifacts, mixed metaphors, or clarity breaks touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but highly purposeful: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and pressure) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, with metaphors staying within a small, consistent palette of sound, glass, weather, and textiles so they don’t blur sense. Syntax and sentence length vary enough to keep momentum, even in long periodic lines. The only check against a higher score is occasional nearness to purple in phrases like “vaulting hush” or “fluidly logical cadence,” which some editors might trim for austerity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is vivid and efficient for the most part, with many sentences doing double duty for mood, worldbuilding, and character (“peaches that tasted like childhood memories and apples that induced dreams of possible futures”). Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent; it rarely slides into true purple or mixed metaphors. There’s minor redundancy and a few abstract phrases (“beautiful absurdity,” “futuristic nostalgia”) that are less sharp than surrounding images, but no serious loops or artifacts. The prose is easily at a competitive level as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double-duty for atmosphere and character, and the suffocation/breath/fire motifs are deployed with intention rather than churn. There is some risk of over-saturation in metaphor (starlight as frozen tears, embers, burned bridges, loaded emptiness) but it remains legible and doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image. Redundancy is minimal; reflection is compressed and anchored cleanly in present stimuli. The final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is strong: high information density, vivid metaphors, and virtually no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful, extending the economic and quantum motifs rather than becoming random ornament; images like “pixels sliding sideways like they were squeezing through a seam between worlds” and “footsteps as tiny barometric scars” are both clear and original. Syntax and paragraphing create forward motion without confusion, and the climax reads crisply. The only restraint on an even higher score is sheer density—a constant metaphor load that occasionally risks feeling a touch “cute”—though it never quite tips into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density—many sentences carry setting, mood, and theme simultaneously—and the rhythm generally propels rather than stalls. However, figurative language is heavily stacked (“powdered light,” “ghost-frequency that tasted of brass and rain,” “each rotation a generation”), occasionally flirting with purple prose. Some concepts are reiterated in adjacent lines (golden shadows, eloquent silence) in ways that feel more ornamental than escalating. Despite this lushness, causality and closure remain clear, and there are no major scaffolding or clarity artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush yet mostly precise, with high information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and meaning. Figurative language is abundant but rarely mixed or contradictory, and important beats (unsnapping the clasp, armor falling, final vigil) remain clear. There is some risk of over-saturation in stacked modifiers and abstractions, which slightly blunts momentum in places. Nonetheless, the closure image is sharp, and obvious scaffolding, loops, or cadence templates are largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid, economical, and doing multi-layered work; metaphors are mostly coherent, grounded in the world of archives, bodies, and weather (“closingtime,” “surname snapped in half,” “hallway” versus “abyss”). Syntax varies and momentum rarely stalls; almost every sentence advances character, mood, or theme simultaneously. There is a high density of figurative language, which occasionally brushes purple, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than ornamental or looping. No significant scaffolding, redundancy, or technical errors impede clarity or dilute the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet remarkably efficient: most sentences do two or three jobs at once (worldbuilding, theme, and immediate action) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent—starlight as code, copper as conduit, reflections as maps—rather than a random metaphor grab bag. Rhythm varies naturally; there’s no template cadence, and the closure beat lands cleanly in image and sense. A few formulations flirt with grandiosity, but none genuinely obscure causality or dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: highly figurative, information-dense sentences that usually do more than one job and maintain clarity. Recurring constructions (“quietly vivid,” “negative space,” “as dewdrops form”) are patterned rather than accidental, creating a cohesive texture. That said, the prose occasionally approaches purple—metaphors stack densely enough that some images (“a snake devouring its own tail made of breath and brass”) risk decorative excess rather than added pressure. Momentum stays intact, but a slight pruning of figurative layers would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but generally precise: images like “leaves began to fall upward” and “her heart mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds after rain” are vivid and coherent. Most sentences do double duty—worldbuilding and theme, or action and mood—without obvious scaffold or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur meaning, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. A few phrases verge on purple (“imprisoned moonlight,” “buoyed by the gentle weight”) yet remain legible and tonally apt.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, character, and theme—while maintaining clear causality and momentum. The figurative language is dense (“chill climb his ribs like a ladder of mercury,” “ash that refused to fall”), but the metaphors are generally precise and non-contradictory, and they reinforce rather than obscure the underlying logic. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn; repetition (“beneath the ashes,” “three-seventeen”) is pattern-driven and purposeful, not accidental looping. The sheer richness borders on purple in places, which can slightly blur urgency, but it never materially muddies the closure image or sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: sentences are varied and musical, images are coherent and layered, and nearly every line carries multiple jobs (world-building, theme, emotional state). Figurative language is dense but controlled; metaphors of weight, metal, and light are sustained without slipping into muddle or contradiction. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm adjusts appropriately between incantatory and concrete beats. The only constraint keeping this just shy of top-tier is that the uniformly lush style risks slight saturation, leaving little room for contrast or rougher textures that might sharpen the most pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, yet generally precise; most sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, emotion, and motion—without obvious redundancy. A few lines flirt with purple or slightly overpacked metaphor (“colors no tongue could name,” “tasted like every lullaby ever hummed in the dark”), but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum through the central pursuit and climax at the harp, and there are no significant scaffolding or loop artifacts. Slight pruning in 2–3 of the most abstract figurative moments would heighten impact without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, images that usually do double duty (world-building plus psychology), and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are inventive and largely coherent (“second skeleton announcing my crimes,” “wedding ring made of scars”), and syntax varies enough to maintain propulsion. The figurative load is heavy but pattern-consistent; the piece teaches and then executes its baroque lyric style, so clarity and closure remain intact. A few lines verge on saturation—equation after equation risks redundancy—which trims a bit of sharpness from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm and length, metaphor is controlled and coherent, and nearly every line carries multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme). The prose is dense and richly figurative, but the imagery remains legible and avoids mixed metaphors or scaffold repetition; patterns like light/anchors/tide are purposeful. There’s a mild risk of saturation at a few moments, yet momentum and clarity hold, especially around the key beats of stepping through the painting and returning the fragment. The final images land cleanly and are not dulled by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, dense, and often striking (“the office exhaled darkness like a lung collapsing”); nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs. Figurative language is mostly coherent and on-theme, with horology, elevators, and circus imagery interweaving smoothly. However, the sheer saturation of metaphor occasionally risks purple over-intensity, slightly blurring immediacy and edge in places. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding artifacts, but a touch more air would likely heighten rather than diminish impact.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with meaning, avoid scaffolding, and most metaphors are fresh and coherent, often pulling double duty for world-building and theme. The rhythm moves smoothly from contemplative to urgent as the library destabilizes, and there’s no real redundancy or confusion in sequencing. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, and a few metaphors (“cracked chase,” “lungs already full of future alphabets”) risk feeling ornamental rather than pressure-driven, slightly blurring impact. Trimming or grounding a handful of the showiest images would sharpen an already impressive style.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences advance character, world, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and rarely feels muddled; images like “sorrow itself were being tucked into bed” and “constellations learning their names” are both clear and thematically apt. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical rhythms. The lushness edges toward purple in a few spots, but it doesn’t obscure causality or blur key beats, including the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are mostly precise, and figurative language is inventive while staying legible. Many lines do multiple jobs at once (world, theme, and emotion), and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. The density of metaphor is high, but it rarely tips into muddle or purple excess, and crucial beats (the confession, the sky cracking) are clear. Minor tightening could further sharpen momentum, but the prose already meets a high literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is very strong: nearly every sentence does double duty for image and concept, and rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from congealing. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (metal, rain, stone, breath, silence), with minimal mixed-metaphor interference. Momentum never stalls despite the lushness; each line pushes either downward motion or deepening of the rule-set. A slight sense of saturation—almost every sentence is “on”—keeps this just shy of flawless minimalism, but it’s well within elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept—and an ear for rhythm that suits the lyric intent. Figurative language is frequent but coherent, clustering around a small set of vehicles (sea, machinery, light, ledger) so it rarely muddies sense; “turbine-hum,” “gears of salt and starlight,” and “each curl of driftwood fall like a word forgiven” are emblematic. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. The only restraint on a higher score is occasional near-purple richness that slightly softens the edge of key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is lush but largely precise: most metaphors (etched glass as “scripture of shadows,” earth as “umbral tenderness”) are coherent and help carry both emotion and concept. Information density is high; almost every sentence does at least two jobs (advancing season, deepening image, or recharging motif) with minimal padding or boilerplate. There is some risk of purple prose due to the relentless figurative pressure and the occasional abstract noun cluster (“dawning hush,” “hidden layers inside their own chest”), but clarity rarely suffers. A slight pruning of explicit theme language would make the lyricism feel entirely earned and avoid any sense of over-insistence.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely informative, and generally do more than one job (worldbuild, characterize, and advance stakes simultaneously). Figurative language (“dune-sheet parted like a sigh,” “futures closing like doors”) is vivid and usually controlled, with few mixed or strained metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and momentum is maintained despite high description density. The lushness occasionally nears purple, but never quite tips into opacity or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and multi-function, often advancing setting, theme, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful (“whale bones in a desert,” “memory is also solvent”), with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. A few moments risk feeling slightly over-stacked with abstractions, but they don’t obscure causality or blur the closure image. Overall rhythm and clarity are publishable-caliber, with only minor tightening needed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but highly efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character, and conceptual work) without redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is fresh (“greenhouse glass… quiver like a tuning fork,” “soft velvet disquiet”) and rarely feels mixed or purple; line-level clarity remains strong even during surreal turns. There are no noticeable loops or template cadences, and transitions (especially into and out of the flashback) are clean. The only mild cap is that almost every sentence is ornate, leaving little room for stark contrast or silence that might sharpen pivotal moments even more.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and motion) and the figurative language is mostly apt, fresh, and thematically aligned. There are a few points where density of metaphor stacks (“wild serenity,” “silk soaked in dawn,” “furiously tranquil”) risks purple excess, but it rarely obscures clarity or causality. Repetition of key phrases reads intentional rather than loopy, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. The lushness might benefit from an occasional plainer sentence to give the most striking images more room to land.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and stakes simultaneously. Figurative language (“clouds surged like slow whales,” “stones dropped into cold milk”) is vivid and mostly disciplined, avoiding mixed metaphors or clutter. A few lines flirt with over-ornamentation, but they don’t obscure causality or muddy the closure image. The final paragraphs, in particular, are clean, rhythmic, and free of scaffolding or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies”). Sentences generally advance mood or meaning without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops; the story moves forward smoothly even during reflective passages. Some metaphoric stacking (“ribbon of starlight stretching backward through every cataclysm”) verges on purple but doesn’t quite tip into muddle or redundancy. Minor tightening could heighten impact, but line-level craft is already at a high literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority) and very few true redundancies or scaffolding lines. Figurative language is largely coherent and motif-bound (bees, honey, ash, smoke, weight), avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. It teeters near purple at times, but the throughline of concrete sensory detail (stained glass panes, soot motes, hairline fracture) keeps it grounded and legible. Momentum is appropriate to a contemplative piece; no obvious loops or structural artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose shows strong rhythmic control and high information density—most sentences carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and legible; images extend the core metaphor of time rather than spiraling into mixed or incoherent comparisons. There are no notable scaffolding loops or clunky transitions; the piece reads smoothly aloud and sustains momentum despite its meditative mode. A small fraction of metaphors (“blood from a bitten minute”) lean toward showiness, but they do not materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is often excellent, with high information density and multi-functioning images (e.g., the buzzing broken string becoming a sigh once mended). Rhythm is varied and pleasing, and there are few, if any, outright clunky sentences. That said, the figurative density is very high—metaphor piled on metaphor (“chord,” “loom of almost,” “woven dawns,” “burnished hush”)—which risks veering into purple and could be trimmed slightly without loss. The closure image remains clear and strong, but a demanding editor would likely want a touch more spareness.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and thematic charge) with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are inventive yet coherent with the established world (granite as lung, fossilized lightning, intestines as corridors toward understanding) and don’t tangle or contradict one another. The rhythm varies nicely, and paragraphs feel purposefully cut; there are no obvious loops or filler lines, and grammar and mechanics are clean. The only minor check is that figurative density is consistently high, which may slightly blunt impact in a few spots but doesn’t materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without noticeable scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and purposeful, with few, if any, mixed metaphors or strained images. Rhythm varies effectively between long, sinuous lines and sharper beats at key turns (“The fly twitched.”). A marginal tightening in a couple of descriptive phrases could sharpen momentum, but there are no real artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is unusually strong: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and thematic echo—while maintaining clarity. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and purposeful; images like “narrow vastness” and “flowers shaped outstretched hands” are striking and legible. There is mild risk of over-saturation, with metaphor following metaphor in a way that could fatigue some readers and slightly blur emphasis at peak moments. Nonetheless, there are no major loops, scaffolds, or syntactic artifacts, and momentum carries cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, with many sentences doing multiple jobs—world-building, emotional shading, and thematic echo simultaneously. Metaphors like “spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise” push toward the purple but remain legible and thematically aligned rather than incoherent. There’s little scaffold or redundancy; the piece maintains momentum despite its lyric texture. The slight overabundance of figurative flourishes in some high-pressure moments keeps it just shy of the most rarefied tier.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but largely earns its figurative weight; metaphors are vivid, generally coherent, and multi-functional, layering atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotion in a tight space. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and most carry more than one job without obvious scaffolding or repetition; there’s little to no synonym churn or template cadence. A few lines verge on purple (“heartbeat stretched into whale song,” “blessed pariah”) but remain comprehensible and tonally aligned with a high-literary mode. Line-level craft supports rather than obscures causality and closure, though a touch more spareness at peak beats could further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the writing is polished, dense, and musical; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and theme together). Metaphor is frequent but largely coherent and fresh (“coat billowing like torn moonlight,” “snow that remembered every footstep but kept the secrets”), with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is a mild risk of saturation—nearly every line reaches for an image—which some editors might ask to trim for air, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No major syntactic or grammatical slips, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but largely earns its lyricism: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, tone, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned (clocks, pawns, wingbones, shadows), and the rhythm modulates well between descriptive breath and tense beats. It does flirt with overload—nearly every sentence is figurative, and phrases like “nomadic penumbra” plus “luminous absence” risk stacking abstraction—but clarity and momentum are preserved. With a touch more austerity in a few lines, this would be truly top-tier line work.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence does double duty for worldbuilding, mood, and character, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is inventive yet coherent (“titles shift beneath like eels in a sack,” “books in a cataract of burning alphabets”) and rarely muddies sense or causality. Momentum is sustained through syntactic variety and efficient paragraphing, especially around the custodian’s appearance and the lightning-strike climax. The only slight constraint keeping this just under 9 is occasional near-saturation of metaphor that could, at elite-edit level, be pruned for even sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence-level craft is precise and economical despite its richness; most lines do double- or triple-duty for character, setting, and theme without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent (“woven hush,” “pocket of arrested time,” “winnowing that separated useful remorse from paralyzing shame”) and supports, rather than obscures, clarity. There are no notable paraphrase loops or syntactic templates, and the prose accelerates or lingers in sync with emotional beats. The closure image—the righted king, the resumed thunder, the line about the board—is cleanly rendered with no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: high information density, minimal redundancy, and metaphors that are not only vivid but thematically aligned (feather, prism, bone, breath). Sentences vary in length and structure, creating a pleasing auditory rhythm that supports rising and falling tension. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it doesn’t blur sense or obscure causality, and there are no clear mixed metaphors or scaffolding artifacts. The only restraint is that nearly every line is metaphorically charged, which, while impressive, leaves little room for the kind of plainness that can make peak images hit even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, vivid, and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs of worldbuilding, mood, and action. Rhythm varies well, and crucial beats are clearly rendered. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, pushing the piece toward purple in places and risking saturation. There are no serious clarity issues or loops, but strategic restraint in a few spots could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is dense but disciplined: nearly every sentence does double duty for mood, character, or world, and figurative language is rich without becoming incoherent or redundant. The rhythm varies well across the piece—long, sinuous descriptive lines give way to sharper, declarative pivots at choice points (“Ren did not look back”). There are no evident paraphrase loops or template cadences; imagery is precise and non-generic, with no mixed metaphors that blur sense. Any slight tendency toward lushness remains controlled enough that momentum and clarity never suffer, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with many lines doing double duty for mood and theme (“screaming tenderness,” “scent rising like a ghost of every kindness she’d ever been denied”). Information density is high and momentum rarely stalls, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, sometimes generating a sense of over-saturation. There are mild redundancies in conceptual territory (purification, subtle vibrations, screaming vs softness) that could be trimmed for greater impact. Despite that, clarity at closure remains intact, and no metaphors are so mixed as to confuse the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and action) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphor and simile are frequent yet largely apt and self-consistent; rhythm varies well between long, spiraling lines and shorter punctuations. A few formulations veer toward cleverness (“geography of loss has no area codes”) but still serve character and theme rather than feeling gratuitous. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for immediate publication, just shy of utterly flawless minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and grounded in the story’s fungal/storm/eye imagery, avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. Rhythm adjusts well across beats, from the tense descent and experiment to the quieter, reconfigured ascent. The density occasionally skirts purple, but clarity and momentum remain intact, including in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is high-density and musical, with many lines doing double duty (atmosphere plus interiority or world logic), and the final images land with clarity and force. Metaphors are mostly fresh and apt (“fog hums in a bell,” “opal dock gleamed like a closed eye”), and sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony. The level of lyricism is consistently elevated and flirts with overload in places, but it rarely obscures sense or momentum. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax remains clean and legible even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is smooth and clear, with varied sentence structure and good information density—most sentences advance either atmosphere or character. There are a few familiar phrases (“took Elias’s breath away”) and lightly expository statements, but no serious redundancy, muddled metaphors, or scaffolding loops. Rhythm tracks the scene’s calm, exploratory pressure well; the prose never bogs down despite substantial description. It reads as professional and polished, though it stops short of stylistic daring or heightened compression that might elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-by-line, the writing is dense but generally purposeful: most sentences add either world-rule information, emotional shading, or pressure. Rhythm varies well, especially toward the climax when shorter, more concrete actions (“she stepped onto the dais”) punctuate the imagery. A few moments verge on purple or redundant (“air thinned into lace, a lacy menace”; slightly stacked metaphors), but they rarely obscure sense or causality. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the final images land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with high information density and imagistic payoffs—e.g., fissures “like luminous veins” and shadows as “long ribbons that tied past to future.” Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and most images do double-duty for worldbuilding and emotion. However, figurative language is very dense, and a few metaphors verge on overwrought or redundant, slightly blurring rather than sharpening impact (e.g., “palette of resolve,” “scientifically romantic paradox” stacked with other abstractions). A modest pruning of the most abstract or repeated formulations would improve propulsion and clarity without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and information-dense; nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs—world-building, interiority, and thematic charge—without major redundancy. The figurative language is mostly coherent and fresh (e.g., “autumn tongues,” “mouth open like a broken shutter”), and syntax remains clear. There is a mild tendency toward sustained metaphor density, especially in the middle, that flirts with purple and could benefit from a few plainer grounding lines for contrast. Still, momentum and clarity hold, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the writing is precise, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences accomplish multiple tasks (scene, character, and theme) simultaneously. Metaphor use is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with recurring images (breath, fog, water, birth) creating a cohesive texture rather than scattered ornamentation. A couple of phrases (“maps of emotional terrain,” “ordinary miracles”) nudge toward abstraction or familiar lyric shortcuts, but they do not significantly stall momentum or muddle meaning. There is no evident scaffolding, synonym churn, or structural repetition that reads as artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but efficient: most sentences perform multiple tasks (worldbuilding, emotion, and forward motion) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent—the crystal, breath, storm, and story motifs recur in purposeful ways without muddling sense. Syntax varies naturally, and paragraphing supports momentum from setup through ritual to aftermath; there are no noticeable loops or redundant restatements. The closing image sequence (broken quill, rested tools, stories that know how to fly) lands cleanly and without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“Headlines tomorrow would claim she’d bottled a soul, but she knew better: she had released one, and kept the echo”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically linked to music, media, and haunting. A few moments verge on excess or self-awareness (“each one a metaphor she had once advised clients with”) but do not materially obscure action or cost. There are no evident loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony that would drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is high: sentences are dense but generally efficient, often doing double duty for setting, concept, and emotion without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled and internally consistent (“light that cast no shadows,” “ants of ink”); it rarely muddies sense even in peak beats. There is a mild tendency toward saturation—nearly every sentence is metaphorically charged—which can slightly blunt impact at elite-publication standards. Still, momentum holds and the closure image is crisp rather than obscured by the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and memorable metaphors (“razor edges glinting like frozen lightning,” “each drop that fell representing a moment someone somewhere had surrendered to forgetting”). Line-level clarity is good, and the rhythm supports the meditative pressure of the piece. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and some abstractions and repeated thesis phrases (“what clocks truly measure,” “space between memory and possibility”) veer toward over-explication and faint purple excess rather than allowing image alone to carry weight. Trimming a few explanatory clauses would sharpen momentum and preserve the best images.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is tight: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without padding, and rhythm varies effectively between dense description and clipped action. Metaphor is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (folds, spores, breathing cavern), rarely feeling purple or muddled. There are no notable scaffold loops or syntactic templates dulling momentum, and the final paragraph’s prose carries weight without over-explaining. A couple of concept phrases (e.g., “permeable barriers of regret”) push toward overt symbolism but stay just within control.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and many sentences doing double duty for image and emotion. Metaphors are mostly apt and fresh (“equations like prayers,” “the city was rinsed clean, the rain having paused mid-fall like a held breath”), with only occasional risk of piling lyricism a bit thick. There is some conceptual repetition around the contradictions and betting language, but it reads as motif rather than redundant loop. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum and the closure image is clear and undulled by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are largely precise, and almost every line carries either character, atmosphere, or structural work. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and pattern-consistent, supporting the haunted, musical tone rather than feeling like decorative excess. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or clumsy constructions; the prose propels cleanly into the climax and out through the final paragraph. If anything, one or two metaphors could be slightly pared to let the core images (disc, tunnel, track) breathe even more.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and almost every line doing at least two jobs (image plus emotion, or setting plus theme). The metaphoric texture is rich but mostly coherent, with minimal repetition or scaffolding; phrases like “haunted euphoria” recur as a motif rather than a crutch. There are no major clarity issues, though one apparent typo (“she steep the locket itself into the tube”) momentarily jars. Overall momentum holds well for a lyric piece, with no obvious paraphrase-loops or filler paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, inventive metaphors, and very few wasted sentences; many lines do double duty for character, world, and theme (“postman who delivered only apologies,” “pockets full of loneliness like loose change”). The rhythm varies effectively between expansive, baroque clauses and tight, aphoristic punches, giving the piece momentum despite its reflective mode. There is some risk of over-saturation—figurative language is frequent and occasionally stacked—but it rarely muddies clarity or undercuts beats. A touch more spareness around the climactic clock shift could heighten impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with high information density and few redundancies. Metaphors like “consonants of extinct birds, vowels of children who would never be born” are striking and legible, and the syntax varies enough to maintain rhythm. The overall texture edges toward lush, but it stops short of true purple; images remain coherent and non-contradictory. There are no evident loops, scaffolding phrases, or mechanical cadences that dull momentum, though a ruthless editor might trim one or two figurative flourishes for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy, and metaphors are coherent and tailored to the premise (gardening, filaments, hinges). The prose sustains a dense lyric register while keeping cause-and-effect legible, especially during the rewriting sequence and station-wide reaction. There are many figurative turns, but they rarely stack to the point of muddling; rhythm and paragraphing maintain momentum. I see no significant scaffolding, synonym loops, or clarity-breaking artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-by-line prose is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme), and the rhythm generally supports the accumulative build. Metaphors—“moonlight painted silver ladders,” “ballast being tossed overboard,” “water arranged into slow-moving sheet music”—are vivid and coherent, with few mixed or clashing images. There is some density/potential overwriting (nearly every sentence is figurative), which risks diminishing the impact of peak moments rather than letting them stand out. Still, clarity is never lost, and there are no obvious scaffolds or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is generally clear and grammatically sound, with some striking turns of phrase and a consistent metaphorical field (ashes, fire, light, tapestry). Yet the prose suffers from repetition and overstatement: phrases like “volcanic tenderness,” “burning bright,” and the explicit restating of realizations appear in multiple variants, creating a sense of thematic hammering rather than accumulation. Figurative language is dense but not always doing new work, which slightly drags momentum and blurs emphasis. Tightening redundancy and trusting the images more would markedly raise this score.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and very few redundant or flat sentences; nearly every line advances image, emotion, or world logic. The prose is lavish—metaphors and neologistic phrases appear in most sentences—yet syntax remains clear and rhythm varied enough to avoid monotone. A demanding editor might trim a handful of stacked descriptors and near-synonymous flourishes that risk purple over-saturation in high-pressure beats. Crucially, the figurative richness never obscures cause/effect or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally lean and purposeful, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus character or theme). The recurring whisper/metal/storm language forms a clear pattern rather than feeling like synonym churn, and there are few, if any, scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Rhythm varies between shorter, testing lines (“Here,” she whispered) and denser descriptive ones, which suits the accumulating tension. The main limitation is a slight tendency toward overtly thematic phrasing in the final third, but it doesn’t materially blunt clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing action, sharpening image, and deepening theme—without visible scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and harmonious (“reflection back onto itself, weaving light into shadow thread by thread”; “silver thread stitching darkness to firmament”), with very few mixed or strained metaphors. Rhythm varies well, with paragraph and sentence length modulating to create a sense of stillness without stagnation. A handful of adjectives and adverbs could be pared to avoid slight purple overtones, but they do not obscure clarity or dilute the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, dense, and largely purposeful; most metaphors (“reference cards stirred like roosting birds,” “roots dripped night”) carry both image and thematic weight. There is some flirtation with purple (“coat collar soaked in starlight”) but few, if any, outright mixed or confusing metaphors. Sentences vary in length and structure, maintaining momentum despite the lyrical mode. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the closure image is clear and strong rather than blurred by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are dense but generally do double duty for image and emotion, and the metaphors stay within a coherent maritime/embodiment field. There is some risk of over-richness, yet the prose rarely feels padded or repetitive, and key actions remain clear even in lyric passages. Rhythm is varied, with good modulation at high-pressure beats (the island’s root snapping, the whale breaching). No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is rich, original, and information-dense; many sentences do double or triple duty in image, world-building, and theme. Metaphor use is heavy but largely controlled (“color of apologies no one had accepted,” “infant made of endings”), and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. At times the figurative density edges toward saturation, which could risk overshadowing a few emotional beats, but clarity remains intact and the closure image isn’t muddied. Overall, line-level craft is publish-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is dense and image-rich, yet most metaphors are coherent and layered rather than muddled, and nearly every sentence carries atmospheric, thematic, and narrative weight simultaneously. There is some risk of saturation, but repetition tends to be purposeful (e.g., “paraphrase,” “tremor of certainty,” ice’s transformations) rather than scaffolding or synonym churn. Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum; the piece rarely feels bogged down despite its lyricism. Copy-level control is strong, with no evident mechanical errors or confusing constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, worldbuilding) and the rhythm supports the accumulative, incantatory feel. Figurative language is vivid and mostly precise, with few mixed metaphors and minimal redundancy. That said, density is high enough—especially around thematic statements—that it occasionally edges into purple, and a couple of later abstractions (“the terrible beauty of things that survive transformation”) repeat previously earned nuance. Momentum holds, but a leaner final third would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are syntactically clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with several striking images (e.g., equipment “drooping like wilted flowers”). There is some conceptual and lexical repetition, and a tendency toward didactic abstraction in places, but it rarely obscures meaning or momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent and thematically aligned rather than purple for its own sake. Tightening redundant thematic statements would sharpen the impact without major structural changes.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and often evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some tendency toward repetition of phrasing and abstract formulations (“the truth she had discovered,” “lesson she had learned,” “genuinely artificial”) that could be pared for greater sharpness. A few lines edge into didactic or near-platitudinous territory, slightly dulling momentum near the end. Nonetheless, clarity is strong, and the final constellation image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is dense and often striking—many sentences carry two or three jobs, blending setting, theme, and character in compressed images. Rhythm varies well across the piece, and the metaphors are generally apt and thematically aligned (tarot as circuit diagram, rain as currency, grids as civilization remnants). There is some risk of overwriting, with figurative language in nearly every line and occasional near-redundancies in how collapse and speculation are framed, which slightly blunts impact. Still, clarity holds throughout, the closure image is sharp, and there are no major scaffolding or cadence artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, mood) while advancing the accumulative pressure. Metaphoric language is frequent but largely coherent, and key recurring images are re-used with reweighted meaning rather than as decoration (“atoms of nostalgia” evolving from dust to freckles to wings). There is some drift into familiar lyric formulations (“copper tears,” “forbidden knowledge,” “end of innocence”), and the near-constant figurativeness risks edging toward purple, slightly dulling impact where a plainer line might cut deeper. Nonetheless, line-level craft is strong, clean, and rhythmically aware.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, motion) and rarely feel like scaffolding, and metaphors are internally consistent and world-true (“pollen that glowed with luminous regret”). The rhythm varies well, and the final images are clean and potent. However, figurative density is very high almost everywhere, occasionally edging toward uniform lushness where a plainer sentence or two might sharpen contrast and momentum. This slight over-saturation is the only real constraint on an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet mostly economical, with images doing double or triple duty for setting, emotion, and theme—the ring’s clink, the braid falling, the stove burning the lecture pages. Sentences flow well aloud, with varied openings and rhythm that propels rather than bogs down despite high figurative content. Metaphors are coherent and apt to the world (ice, tide, footprints, vertebrae, record grooves) and converge around a consistent textural palette. There is a slight risk of over-ornamentation, but no real paraphrase loops or muddled comparisons that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences carry multiple functions at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and forward motion) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (wounds, roots, time, reading), and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or template cadences, and grammar/usage are clean. A slight trim of a few metaphors in non-peak moments would improve clarity and propulsion further.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and story, rhythm varies, and the narrative remains clear despite dense imagery. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned (film, projection, thunder, incubation), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. The prose does verge on lush/purple in places, with figurative language stacked across many consecutive sentences, which slightly blurs impact and keeps momentum from feeling razor-sharp. Still, clarity at closure is never compromised, and overall information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is often excellent: many sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, character) without obvious scaffolding, and the final paragraphs land with clean, charged images. There is some figurative density and repetition in the “stardust/aurora/glass” cluster, bordering on purple prose in a few spots, but most metaphors are coherent and purposeful. Redundancy is minimal; the piece rarely restates a point without adding nuance. A slight trim of the most abstract or piled-on metaphors would improve momentum and keep the lyricism from feeling over-saturated.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful imagery, and syntactic variety that generally sustains momentum despite long sentences. Figurative language is abundant but coherent—“pages turning themselves, searching for singers,” “children made of pollen and starlight”—and rarely feels mixed or gratuitous. There are a few moments where multiple metaphors stack in close succession and slightly blur impact, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closing image. Overall the prose easily passes the read-aloud and clarity tests while maintaining a distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose operates at a high lyric density with strong control—most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, or image plus character). Metaphors are inventive and largely coherent (“tuning fork struck by moonlight,” “boots dangling from a vine of coaxial cable”) and the rhythm varies enough to avoid sing-song monotony. There is some edge-pushing toward purple and aphoristic compression in the final third, but it doesn’t materially obscure action or closure. Repetition of key phrases reads patterned and intentional rather than as unedited loops.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with efficient anchoring and few syntactic tangles. At times it leans toward abstraction and repetition of similar conceptual formulations (“routes between worlds tangled,” “courage unused simply waits for recognition”), softening impact. The final sentence is incomplete, which interrupts the otherwise controlled cadence at a crucial moment. Overall momentum holds, but trimming a few near-duplicate insights and sharpening one or two metaphors would elevate the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with figurative language that is largely fresh and precise (“pulse fluttering like a trapped bird,” “knuckles whitening like sunrise through ice”) and rarely redundant. Nearly every sentence does double duty—worldbuilding, mood, and character are interwoven without scaffolding or synonym loops. Rhythm varies effectively, and the closing sentences land cleanly without figurative muddle. I see no line-level artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and pull multiple duties (worldbuilding, theme, and action simultaneously). Metaphors are mostly coherent and vivid, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; rhythm is well-controlled from opening to final image. However, figurative density is very high almost throughout (“brocade of borrowed starlight,” “closed winter,” “liquid night,” etc.), which occasionally flirts with purple prose and slightly blurs immediacy. A demanding editor would likely trim or space some images for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with vivid metaphors that mostly avoid mixed imagery and do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). Sentence rhythm varies, and almost every line carries new information or pressure; there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few phrases flirt with abstraction (“periodically eternal habit,” “cartographic skin”), but they remain anchored enough in concrete referents not to blur sense or momentum. Line-level craft supports rather than obscures the closure image, with the final paragraph crisply recharging earlier motifs (station silhouette, tapping) without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs of image, worldbuilding, and emotion. However, figurative language is nearly constant and sometimes tilts toward purple (“swallows burst skyward like peppercorns flung into blue soup”), risking tonal overrichness. There are few scaffolding or redundancy issues; momentum generally carries through without looping. Clarity at key turns (awakening, ignition, launch) remains intact despite the ornate style, but a touch more spareness at peaks would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing triple duty for worldbuilding, mood, and character (“grafted epigenetic switches” as quilting is exemplary). Rhythm and variation are well-handled; there’s little scaffolding or repetition, and cause/effect clarity stays intact despite lyric compression. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, edging toward purple in spots and occasionally risking overload in high-pressure beats. That tonal richness mostly works but slightly blunts urgency, preventing this from landing in the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries more than one function (image, emotion, and theme) without redundancy. Metaphors are vivid yet coherent (“the freeze is not paralysis; it is a microscope”), and figurative density serves the lyric mode rather than cluttering it. There are no obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops; momentum never stalls despite reflective content. A few aphoristic lines skate close to purple but remain grounded enough not to blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, dense, and imaginative, with many sentences doing triple duty (advancing action, deepening character, layering theme). The metaphoric system is largely coherent (coastlines, tides, fragments, spirals), and syntax varies enough to keep rhythm from becoming mechanical. That said, there is some overwriting and repetition—especially the motif “questions rhetorical questions” and multiple similar abstractions—that risks blur and marginally slows momentum. Because clarity at the ending image remains intact and no figurative muddle undercuts closure, the debt is limited but keeps this just short of elite-line mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, imagery is vivid, and most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and plot at once). There is some repetition of key ideas (“why time slows,” “defense mechanism,” “temporal fold”) that edges toward redundancy rather than intensification, and a few abstractions (“universe’s greatest secret,” “drowning in consciousness”) are less precise than the surrounding concrete images. Still, momentum rarely stalls, and the final images of ink, portal, and encampment resonate clearly. Tightening a handful of explanatory phrases and slightly pruning the explicit philosophizing would lift the prose into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are vivid, syntax varied, and most lines do double duty advancing action and atmosphere (“hissing like distant applause”). The metaphoric density is high but generally coherent and legible, and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few spots stray toward purple or near-repetition (reiterating “dizzying quiet”) and push up against saturation, which could be pruned for even greater impact. Nonetheless, momentum and clarity remain intact through the climax and closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) and the rhythm varies well enough to sustain a lyric mode. Images like “roses bloomed brighter in the spots where blood had soaked the earth” are sharp and grounded. There is some tendency toward repetition of conceptual phrases (“inculcating plants with values,” reiterated explanations of the method) and a few near-purple combinations (“tranquil blaze”) that feel slightly ornamental. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and figurative language seldom muddies sense.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet generally precise; metaphors (“constellations lumber earthward like sleepwalkers tangled in their own glittering nets”) are imaginative and internally coherent. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences advance image, world-rule, and emotion simultaneously, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. The figurative density skirts purple but is controlled, with recurring motifs (nets, lullabies, chords, teeth) creating pattern rather than clutter. No significant loops or syntactic artifacts dull clarity, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet disciplined: metaphors are thematically linked (printing, astronomy, orbit, ink) and rarely feel gratuitous or mixed, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Sentence rhythm varies, with long, textured lines balanced by shorter declaratives to land key beats (“The story continues.” “Assume tomorrow.”). A few phrases flirt with purple but stay coherent and grounded in the story’s conceptual matrix, so momentum is maintained rather than bogged down. Copy is clean, and the closure image (broken nib, sunrise ink, new orbit) is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, but most metaphors are coherent and multi-functional, advancing both atmosphere and emotional stakes. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence pulls weight. At times the figurative load approaches saturation, risking purple, yet clarity at the climax and closure remains intact. Rhythm and sentence variety are strong, with no significant looping or template-cadence artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are packed with information yet rarely feel redundant, and most metaphors are coherent, specific, and thematically relevant (e.g., “meaning felt like chalk dust on her tongue”). There is a high density of figurative language, but it’s patterned and controlled rather than indulgently purple, and it does not obscure causality or the closure image. Rhythm and syntax are varied; no noticeable scaffold phrases or synonym loops recur to break immersion. A slightly relentless lyricism might fatigue some readers, but it does not materially drag momentum or blur key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is lean yet rich, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, world, and theme at once. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; motifs (fire, tesserae, constellations, arms) recur in ways that deepen meaning rather than feel repetitious. I see minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and rhythm on a read-aloud test feels varied and intentional. The only restraint on an even higher score is that a couple of late abstract phrases slightly soften the sharpness of otherwise image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty for mood and world-building, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. The prose leans lush, yet metaphors tend to be coherent, on-theme, and sensorially grounded; they rarely feel like empty ornament. Momentum is well-managed for a lyric piece: each sentence tends to add a new facet rather than rephrase the last. The only notable limitation is that figurative density is high across the whole piece, which risks saturation and slightly blurs a few emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are mostly clean, varied, and information-dense, with few if any genuine redundancies, and the geode/light imagery is handled with reasonable precision. There is some phrase-level repetition (“fractally precise”) and occasional stackings of abstraction (“willowglass hope,” “hidden pathways”) that flirt with preciousness but don’t quite tip into muddle. The reliance on summary in the back half is a structural rather than syntactic issue, and the final image is clear despite the elevated diction. This is polished, publication-ready prose, just not at the level of razor-honed minimalism or formally inventive brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images precise, and almost every line does multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme). The piece leans heavily into figurative language, but the metaphors are mostly clean and aligned, and the prose maintains clarity through the most intense beats. There is some risk of density tipping toward purple—many sentences carry stacked modifiers—and a few abstractions (“a growing skin of knowledge meant to outlast bone”) could be tightened. Still, momentum rarely stalls, and the closure image is sharp rather than muddied.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are vivid, metaphors generally coherent, and most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, character, theme). Repetition of motifs (grain, thread, buttons, silence) feels patterned rather than accidental, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. The prose does run consistently lush, with stacked figurative language in nearly every line, which risks saturation and slightly blurs impact in a few spots. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet purposeful: most sentences do at least double duty in atmosphere, character, and plot, and the rhythm modulates nicely between long, textured lines and shorter emphatic beats. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and motif-driven—snow, silver, hush, gardening—without mixed metaphors or decorative flab. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and key beats (pillbox micro-code, transmitter warming, pillbox’s destruction) are given crisp, uncluttered treatment. The lushness nudges toward purple only in a couple of phrases, but clarity and momentum are never compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is ambitious and information-dense; most sentences multitask to advance atmosphere, theme, and plot simultaneously, and rhythm is varied and musical. Figurative language is largely coherent and on-concept, with threads, ink, fog, and ferries reinforcing one another. However, the frequency of metaphors and abstract noun phrases (“ambient awareness,” “spindrift serenity”) occasionally edges into purple density that risks slowing momentum and slightly obscuring immediacy. This stylistic excess does not damage closure clarity, but it does prevent top-band concision and sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is rich yet mostly efficient, often doing multiple jobs at once (world-building, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and images like “chimney smoke flattened against the copper sky” or “sharp gentleness, the flavor of smoke before it flattens” are striking and coherent. There is a high density of figurative language, and a few moments edge toward purple or conceptual repetition, but clarity and momentum are preserved. Trimming 5–10% of the more declarative or redundant thematic phrasing would likely sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is elegant and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The figurative language is rich but generally coherent, and key metaphors (oars, light, petals) are reused rather than constantly reinvented. There is a mild risk of over-saturation—very few sentences are purely plain—which can blur edge and momentum at times. Nonetheless, causality and the closing image remain clear, and there are no evident structural artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, vivid, and multifunctional, and figurative language is generally precise (“continents of possibility that only a solitary cartographer could draw”). There is some density—nearly every line is metaphor-laden—which risks saturation but rarely obscures sense or momentum. Repetition is purposeful (hum, reflection, breathing) rather than artifact-like, and there are no major syntactic stumbles or clarity breaks. A bit more sparseness in a few peak beats could let key images breathe and heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished, with strong rhythm and high information density—most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and emotional shading. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and motif-driven (threads, nests, color), and there are few, if any, scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A couple of phrases (“inevitably whimsical sound”) verge on self-consciousness, and the unrelenting lushness slightly risks saturation, but clarity and momentum remain intact. The closing lines, in particular, are precise and cleanly echo earlier images without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the writing is dense, rhythmic, and multi-purpose; many sentences carry atmosphere, world-building, and emotional state at once (“a gritty lullaby that tasted of copper and thunderstorms” both describes sound and her embodied response). Metaphoric saturation is high but mostly controlled and thematically coherent (grit, bone, blood, coins, cradles), with very few strained or mixed images. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum through a primarily interior/action blend. The chief constraint on a higher score is that in a few places the lyrical texture slightly risks over-luxuriance in what is ostensibly a time-critical beat, though it never quite slips into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most images do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, building a consistent aesthetic rather than stacking random metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line either advances action, deepens character, or thickens atmosphere. The only restraint on a higher score is that the sustained lyricism occasionally risks saturation in high-pressure moments where a touch more spareness might sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, vivid imagery, and purposeful metaphor that usually does multiple jobs at once (e.g., “caution tape that no longer existed,” “eyes wide enough to hold the whole night”). The prose occasionally runs rich, but the figurative language is controlled and pattern-consistent rather than purple for its own sake; there are no real paraphrase loops or template cadences. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. The only ceiling is that density is so high it flirts with over-saturation in spots, which might prompt a demanding editor to trim a metaphor or two.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is high: most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character, rhythm is varied, and key images (verdigris thumbprint, sky like old pennies, “perfume of denial”) are memorable and precise. There is a lot of figurative language, but it’s mostly coherent and pattern-consistent rather than random ornament, and information density is strong for the word count. A few phrases verge on purple or conceptual stacking (“rain that now fell with purposeful direction instead of anonymous dread”) that slightly blunt sharpness rather than sharpen it. Still, there are no real scaffolding loops or clarity failures; the piece reads as publishable prose with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty for image and theme. Rhythm and syntax vary, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. However, metaphor density is very high, occasionally veering into purple and risking saturation where a simpler line might hit harder (e.g., multiple layered similes in the opening). Trimming a few stacked images would increase clarity and impact without sacrificing the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tight, high-density, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence carries image, character, or theme. Figurative language is frequent but not muddled—motifs of roads, money, fire, and performance stay coherent without mixed metaphors or purple excess. Sentence rhythms vary pleasingly, and the final cadence (“breathed once, twice, then sighed out…”) lands with clarity and emotional weight. One could argue a slight overconcentration of abstractions around “loops” and “routes,” but they remain grounded enough in concrete objects that momentum doesn’t stall.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear despite their length, metaphor choices (“star-charts rustled like sleeping birds,” “tears reflected constellations that had never been named”) are vivid and coherent, and there’s good information density with few true redundancies. The prose occasionally skirts purple, with stacked abstractions and aphoristic phrases in close proximity, but it rarely tips into muddle. Momentum holds across the paragraph-long sentences, though more variation in syntactic length and a few sharper, plainer beats at climaxes could heighten impact. There are no major scaffold loops or technical errors, and the final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich with layered metaphor and generally clears the “ear test,” with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, psychology, atmosphere). Lines like “unbent her knees first, then her spine, then the locked fence of her ribs” marry physical motion and internal shift efficiently. At times the density of imagery (“orchard vortex,” “siege towers,” “war banner,” “timber of tomorrow’s storms”) approaches saturation and risks marginally slowing momentum, but it never obscures causality or the closure image. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without collapsing into redundancy, and there are no significant paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. Figurative density is high but patterned and legible; metaphors (“calendars into a single anxious heartbeat,” “lungs fizzing,” “vegetable code”) remain coherent within the established surreal logic and do not conflict. Rhythm and variation support momentum, especially around the decisive act and closing cadence, which land cleanly and memorably. There are no mechanical errors or clarity breaks that impede reading or blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and imagery that usually does double duty for atmosphere and theme (“candles drowned in their own wax,” “her weight felt lighter than an empty coat”). Metaphor is abundant but mostly controlled, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; sentences propel rather than stall. A couple of phrases (“patching souls is not sewing shut but weaving new cloth, leaving deliberate spaces”) verge on didactic explanation rather than lived sensory experience, and the density of figurative language is near the upper bound of what the scene needs. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact throughout, and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (character, setting, theme) with relatively little scaffolding, and the rhythm varies well. Figurative language is frequent but mostly fresh and apt, with strong audio/technical metaphors that fit the POV. A few moments lean toward slogan or abstraction (“no crowd since had filled,” “membrane that turned loss into listening”), but they do not significantly blur sense or momentum. There are no evident loops, clarity failures, or distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are generally fresh, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and purposeful (“notes that measured wind shear the way lullabies measure fear”), and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. A few moments veer close to purple or overly clever abstraction (“let the equation equal love divided by time”), slightly diluting impact. Overall, momentum holds and clarity remains high despite the density.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is lush and controlled; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and motion) and the piece sustains a high descriptive density without collapsing into muddle. Metaphors are largely coherent and of a piece (metal, tide, memory, identity), and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym loops. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, with very few plain functional sentences to create contrast, which slightly blunts impact and risks reader fatigue at this length. Trimming a handful of metaphors or tightening one or two already-strong images could sharpen the cadence from excellent to truly rare.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Metaphors are abundant but largely coherent and on-theme, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence; read-aloud they have clear propulsion. There are no significant loops or explanatory redundancies, and the final image lands cleanly. The only drag on a higher score is the sheer saturation of figurative language, which occasionally brushes purple and risks softening impact through nonstop lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (character, image, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and there’s little to no synonym churn or dead loops. Metaphors are coherent with the dominant river/map/music palette, and syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged. There is a high density of figurative language, especially early, that edges toward purple but never quite topples clarity or momentum. Trimming one or two metaphor-heavy clauses could sharpen impact even further, but the closure image remains clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, often multi-functional (advancing worldbuilding, theme, and motion simultaneously), and the metaphors are coherent with the story’s logic (“tiles that pulsed like slow heartbeats,” “shelves flickered…like breath held too long”). Some repetitions (“through propagation delays,” “between two fateful letters”) ride the edge of over-patterning but remain purposeful as structural motifs rather than scaffolding. The density of figurative language is high yet mostly controlled; it rarely muddies sense or stalls momentum. A tiny trim of conceptual restatement around the library’s nature could increase sharpness without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is densely figurative but mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion; there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. Motifs like perforation, propagation, and ice recur with variation rather than redundancy, and crucial beats (cracking dome, puddled violin, fading coffee stain) land cleanly. At times the figurative saturation skews toward purple, risking reader fatigue in a longer piece, but clarity and momentum are preserved here. Minor trimming of modifier clusters in early lines would likely elevate the prose from excellent to truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and rarely feel redundant, and images like “time moved like honey through a sieve” and “particles of radiant hush” are striking yet legible. Figurative density is high, but the metaphors are coherent and pattern-consistent, so momentum mostly holds. There are no obvious scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence tends to add new texture or stakes. A touch more spareness around the peak choice could sharpen impact by contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, with many lines multitasking to advance setting, emotion, and theme (e.g., “dark sap that smelled of fermented forgiveness”). Metaphoric motifs (scallop, wine, hush, cycle) are consistent rather than haphazard, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding phrases. At times the density of figurative language edges toward saturation, which may slightly blunt immediacy for some readers at peak beats. Nonetheless, clarity of action and emotional through-line are preserved, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for image, worldbuilding, and theme; rhythm varies nicely and reads well aloud. Figurative language (dust motes of doubt, certainty as a coat, mirror that reflects nothing) is generally clear and non-muddled, and repetition serves pattern rather than redundancy. A few abstractions (“moral unease,” “protected vulnerability,” “larger, more honest world of maybe”) lean toward conceptual labeling and edge into mild overtness. Nonetheless, there are no serious loops or artifacts dragging momentum, and the closure image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; nearly every sentence does multiple jobs of worldbuilding, mood, or thematic seeding. Key images (stone, rings, grotto hum, sycamore hush) recur with clear purpose rather than decorative repetition. There is a mild tendency toward abstract or expository lines in peak beats, but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or blur sense. Line-level craft is strong enough for a serious market, though trimming a few explanatory phrases would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished and often beautiful, with many sentences doing triple duty (worldbuilding, theme, and character in a single image like “ripples overlapping like generations telling their stories”). Metaphorical density is high but mostly coherent; motifs of resonance, birds, dust, and bone are repeated with variation rather than empty churn. There is some redundancy in phrasing and symbolism (“weathered” appears twice in close succession; several sentences restate the same spiritual insight), which slightly dulls momentum. Still, no major artifacts obscure sense or closure, and the final images land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and do multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and integrated into the logic of the world, with very few strained or mixed metaphors. Momentum is well maintained; even reflective turns arise from immediate stimuli and tilt the present action. The minor limitation is occasional near-lushness that could be trimmed for even sharper impact, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphor is generally coherent, and most lines do double duty in advancing image and theme. Figurative density is high but rarely muddles clarity; phrases like “star-smoke” and “pale, luminous vows” are apt and legible. The main flaw is a single slightly over-explanatory, abstract sentence about “every human sound” that verges on essayistic rather than purely imagistic. Otherwise, there is little scaffolding or redundancy, and momentum is well maintained for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is often striking, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) and a strong ear for cadence. However, figurative language is very dense—metaphors like “fossilized radiance,” “frozen starlight,” and “ghosts of light” stack continuously, occasionally flirting with purple prose and risking reader fatigue. A few concept-phrases repeat almost verbatim without always adding new pressure, which slightly drags momentum. Clarity at the climax and closure remains intact, but a leaner line could elevate the piece to top-tier readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are dense with information and image, yet remain legible and propulsive. Figurative language is frequent but usually purposeful, building a coherent symbolic system around recording, mapping, and crystallization; I don’t see significant metaphor-muddle or redundancy. Rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase-loops—nearly every line earns its place. The intensity of imagery comes close to saturation in spots, but it never decisively blurs the core beats or closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is economical yet rich, with many sentences doing double duty (e.g., “It tasted like iron and memory” fuses sensory detail and theme). Rhythm varies well between short punchy lines and longer descriptive sentences, and repetition patterns (bell, drip, counting) read as deliberate motifs rather than loops. Metaphors are coherent and anchored (“rust and regret,” “eyes like ship lanterns”) with no mixed or overwrought vehicles. There’s essentially no visible scaffolding or redundancy, and the closing lines land with clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: images like “twilight that clung…like damp gauze” and “each scrap carrying the weight of a private grief” are precise and evocative without slipping into purple excess. Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing action, revealing character, and setting mood—and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetitive phrasing. Rhythm modulates well from descriptive to climactic beats, maintaining momentum despite the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are densely imagistic yet generally pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, mood, character), and there’s no obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The prose reads smoothly aloud with effective rhythmic variation and strong verbs, and crucial actions remain clear even within lush description. There is persistent high-density figurative language even in peak beats, flirting with purple prose but staying coherent and motif-driven rather than muddled. That ornamental intensity slightly reduces propulsion, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and efficient: most sentences do at least two jobs (world, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and legible, with motifs deliberately repeated rather than churned. A few phrases (“attentively inventive,” “when the sky can hold no more secrets”) flirt with abstraction or purple, but they don’t obscure causality or dull the ending. Rhythm, variation, and clarity at the closure beat are all strong.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, metaphor is inventive (“brain… like a pale jellyfish,” “bell… signaling the approaching rewrite”), and most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and forward motion). There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; almost every sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, or character. Figurative density is high but controlled, and metaphors stay internally coherent rather than piling up into purple blur. It falls just short of the absolute top band because a few abstractions (“ego death,” “narrative fog”) do some telling work that could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double-duty for mood and plot, with few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The metaphorical palette (storm, machinery, roots, breath) is coherent, and figurative language rarely trips over itself or obscures action. There is a tendency toward consistent high lyricism, which approaches purple in places but remains controlled and legible. The final paragraph edges into explanatory abstraction but still lands on a concrete, charged image (the brook and the faint perfume of bloom), preserving momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but controlled; most metaphors are fresh and coherent, often doing double duty for setting and emotion. There’s minimal scaffold or repetition, and each sentence tends to introduce new information or sharpen an image. A few phrases (“macerated itself against his ribs,” “rubber ball made of light”) flirt with purple but don’t obscure meaning or momentum. The final paragraphs land with clear, charged images and no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is rich and deliberate: most sentences do multiple jobs, and images like “pages turning underwater” or “tail curling like a bookmark” feel precise rather than generic. The prose occasionally flirts with density/purple-ness, as figurative language appears in nearly every line, but the metaphors are internally coherent and pattern-consistent (text, light, garden, frost). There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence and supports the slow, ritual feel. Slight over-saturation of imagery keeps it just shy of the very top tier, but it remains elite-level by most standards.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) with minimal scaffolding, and there is little redundancy or dead air. Metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically linked, creating a deliberate motif rather than random ornament; the repetition of “bloom” and “frost” feels patterned not accidental. There is some risk of overload—nearly every sentence is figurative—which may blur emphasis and edge toward purple in places. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved through the ritual, and the closure image (“a sound like a distant penny dropping into frozen water”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is striking: sentences are varied, metaphor choices are often surprising yet apt (“antennas humming like crickets that had learned grammar”), and information density is high. The prose consistently does multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and thematic cueing—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, which edges toward purple and slightly blurs impact in a few places where a plainer line might hit harder. Still, momentum and clarity survive the richness, keeping this in a high band.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: almost every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) and the rhythm modulates well from calm to crisis. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically unified (sideways, slipping, knitting, cables), with no significant mixed metaphors or loops. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; information density is high without obscuring clarity. The only limitation on a top-tier score is that the sustained metaphorical density sometimes risks feeling a shade lush for the pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with metaphors that cohere (“origami” reality, “neuron” threads, “dandelion seed” relationships) and few mixed or confusing images. Sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum in a lyric mode, and most lines do double duty—advancing setting and theme simultaneously. There is some repetition of structures and phrases (“as memories alter…”) and a near-uniform reliance on figurative language, but it rarely obscures sense or dulls the closure image. Tightening a few explanatory restatements would lift it into even sharper territory.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, densely informative, and often do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“Navigation was no longer about arrival but about refusing to disappear”). Imagery is mostly precise and coherent, with recurring motifs (edges, horizons, anchors, light) woven rather than stacked. A few phrases (“somber marvel,” “balancedly curious”) repeat enough to feel slightly mannered, and there is a mild tendency toward aphoristic closure. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and there are no significant loops or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with information, and usually do multiple jobs (advancing plot, revealing character, and sustaining atmosphere). Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and coherent, with recurring image systems (hearts, valves, mist, exposure) rather than random flourish. A few metaphors skate close to overrich (“every spike might be a ghost…”, “condensation had recorded heartbeats in rust”), yet they remain legible and do not stall momentum. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose carries the story’s weight without visible joints.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is controlled and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or image plus theme) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language is rich (e.g., “silent broadcast that still traveled the cable at the speed of regret”) but coherent and pattern-consistent rather than purple; metaphors extend the core conceits of cables, signal, tide, and memory instead of wandering. Rhythm varies effectively between long, tidal sentences and sharper beats at structural turns. No noticeable loops, syntactic monotony, or filter-verb stacks drag momentum, including in the closing third.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding, mood, and theme (e.g., “Its surface tension holding galaxies of spilled midnight”). Metaphoric texture is largely coherent—digital, astronomical, anatomical—without devolving into muddle, and there’s little genuine redundancy or scaffold. There is some risk of over-saturation in places (“dendrites of regret, axons of almost, synapses of maybe”) where figurative layering skirts purple but it does not obscure meaning or closure. Line-level momentum generally keeps moving forward despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lush but purposeful: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and thematic echo) without collapsing into opacity. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and systematized around texture, sound, and embodiment, avoiding mixed metaphors or decorative clutter that would blur sense. Momentum is maintained despite lyric density; there are no obvious loops or scaffolding redundancies. The closure paragraph is especially clean, with crisp, high-impact images and no muddling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmic and varied, images are vivid, and information density is high with little scaffolding or redundancy. The piece does push toward saturation with metaphors and ornate modifiers, which occasionally risks purple prose but rarely obscures sense. Motifs repeat (frostbitten, gravitationally playful, cosmic joke) in ways that are mostly purposeful, though a slightly leaner approach might sharpen impact for elite venues. Clarity remains intact through the climax, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing action, deepening image, and reinforcing theme), and there is little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely clean and legible; images like “sunrise heard through closed eyes” or “tarnished wonder” feel inventive rather than muddled. The main limitation is occasional saturation—nearly every sentence in some stretches carries a metaphor, which risks blurring sharpness and momentum in a few beats. Nonetheless, causality and closure remain clear, and the final images land crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in structure, and often do double duty by advancing both atmosphere and character insight (“tokens clattered…spelling the route”). Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and sensical, with no major mixed metaphors or syntactic muddle, and crucial beats (the storm-drop, the key’s emergence, the trade at the mailbox) are rendered in concrete actions rather than summary. There is some risk of overwriting—nearly every line carries a metaphor or rhetorical flourish—and a few explanatory phrases could be pruned for greater sharpness. Still, momentum is maintained, and the final images land cleanly without being obscured by excess ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently vivid and information-dense, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Metaphor density is high, but images are generally coherent and purposeful (“vines threading down like green notes on a staff of starlight”; the halo as a comma in the sentence of the sky), and key beats are never obscured. There are minor moments of near-redundant flourish (“a wind bell chiming inside the chime of wind bells”) where trimming might sharpen impact, but they don’t blunt closure or causality. Line-level rhythm and clarity remain strong throughout, avoiding true purple muddle or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: inventive metaphors (“Möbius strips of cause and effect,” “topological pressure that forced authors to write”) and high information density do multiple jobs per sentence. There is some repetition and mild over-explanation—several “She understood…” or “She realized…” sentences that restate what images already imply—which slightly slows momentum. Nonetheless, syntax is varied, clarity is preserved despite abstraction, and there are no major figurative muddles or mechanical errors. Trimming a few expository statements would make the prose feel even more effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level writing is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and motion), and the metaphoric density rarely muddies sense. Phrases like “a match struck in a cathedral of salt” and “the gap between heartbeats where forgotten names echo” are vivid yet legible, and the syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm alive. There is mild risk of overload—almost every line carries an image—so a very selective trim could sharpen impact, but clarity at closure remains intact. No obvious scaffolding, loops, or mixed metaphors undercut the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-by-line, the prose is dense but generally efficient, with most metaphors pulling double duty for atmosphere and theme (ivy leaves as keys, idea as ink-cub, her mouth as “living key”). There is some risk of overload—“improbable longing” and star/cosmic phrasing recur enough to edge toward mannerism—but clarity of action and transformation is never lost. Sentences vary in structure and cadence; there’s little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A modest trim of a few abstractions would elevate already strong craft to truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but remarkably efficient: most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once (e.g., “The greenhouse air tasted of crisp nostalgia, cider and rust”). Figurative language is fresh and coherent—ship ribs as whale bones, roots as chandeliers—without mixed metaphors or clutter, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum; even heavily descriptive lines advance stakes or interior state. The high imagery density flirts with purple but remains controlled and legible, especially in the crucial central beats.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and character in the same breath). The metaphoric layering is rich yet mostly coherent; recurring images (shards, shadows, swings, circles) are tightly managed rather than scattered. There’s occasional near-purple saturation, but little in the way of scaffolding, loops, or clumsy exposition, and the final lines land cleanly. Rhythm and syntax support the lyrical, meditative pacing without bogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and high-density, often doing multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and thematic work in the same line), and key beats like the tuning fork and droplet capture are clear and memorable. However, figurative language is very frequent, occasionally stacking (“threads of liquid light weaving between worlds,” “moss became emerald flame, stone sang bass notes of violet”) in ways that verge on purple and could fatigue a demanding literary editor. There are no significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts; grammar and pacing are clean. A bit more restraint or contrast—especially around the climax—would sharpen impact and elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, sonically pleasing, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for mood and narrative. Figurative language is generally precise and apt, and there are no major scaffolding loops or syntactic templates. The main drag is a slight over-saturation of metaphor and abstraction in some beats, which risks purple prose and slightly blurs impact (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush” plus repeated silence-water-light imagery). Nonetheless, clarity at closure remains strong, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense and multi-functional, with very few redundancies, and the read-aloud rhythm is varied and intentional. Imagery is mostly clear and striking (“a scream wearing silence,” “a hush that curled inside her ribs like warm smoke”), and scaffolding is minimal. However, figurative density is near-constant, so in places the prose edges toward purple and risks dulling impact, especially where metaphors stack within a single sentence. A touch more sparseness around key turns would let the best images hit even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, information-dense, and almost every line does double duty for image and meaning. Metaphors are usually precise and thematically apt (magnesium flakes as “unread telegrams,” books dissolving as unread history), and the final cadence is clean and affecting. There is some risk of over-saturation—figurative language appears in a high proportion of sentences, and a couple of formulations (“mass times acceleration equals story over time”) carry a whiff of cleverness-for-its-own-sake. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, theme) with few redundancies, and rhythm varies nicely between long, lush lines and shorter emphatic ones. The figurative density is high but coherent—metaphors (code, storm, music, graffiti) belong to a single conceptual field and rarely clash. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines advance the accumulative pressure or deepen image-systems. At the very edge, one could argue the prose occasionally verges on purple, but clarity and momentum stay intact, including at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is rich and efficient: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the extended metaphors (cipher as music as map as seed) stay coherent. Figurative density is high but pattern-driven—circles, spirals, ascent/descent, warmth/cold—so it rarely feels like purple prose or muddle. A few phrases risk overcompression (“planet’s molten sigh,” “anguish dressed in confetti”) but remain legible and support theme rather than distracting. Momentum never stalls despite lush description, and both opening and closing sentences are strong, charged bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are vivid, and most lines do double duty for setting and emotion. Figurative language is occasionally stacked (“cup about to spill its last drop of starlight,” “dusty starlight… old photons settle”) to the edge of purple, but clarity is not lost. There is little redundant scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the prose generally keeps momentum. A touch more restraint in metaphor density in high-pressure beats would likely be required for immediate top-tier publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, clear sequencing, and generally purposeful metaphors tied to astronomy, fractals, and wood. The prose carries momentum despite a reflective mode; there is little scaffolding or redundancy, and the final paragraph cleanly crystallizes prior motifs. Some lines veer toward thematic abstraction or mild purple (“map of human limitation that will outlast every face she never learned to remember”), but they do not obscure causality or the closure image. Overall, the language is polished enough for elite venues with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, dense, and musical, with most sentences doing double duty (world-building plus character or theme). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent (light, maps, ink, breath), avoiding mixed metaphors or mush. Momentum is maintained despite lyricism; no obvious scaffolding, synonym loops, or filler clauses appear, and crucial beats are dramatized rather than summarized. A few images edge toward lush (“brass ribs creaking like an old librarian”) but remain clear and purposeful, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and vivid, with most sentences doing double or triple duty—advancing setting, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the mirrors’ “fractal chorus” that literalizes his doubt). Rhythm and sentence length vary well, supporting both the slow, eerie approach and the tighter beats around the key repair and door opening. However, figurative density is high across nearly every line, and certain metaphors feel stacked or slightly self-conscious, risking purple-prose overload at an elite-publication standard. Despite that, clarity of action and emotional throughline remain intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is precise, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; images often do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“a clang like berries caught in wire—beautiful because it hurt”). There is heavy figurative density, but the metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically linked rather than random ornament. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues; the narrative flows smoothly despite its lyricism. The only reason it’s not higher is that a few phrases flirt with purple and could be trimmed without loss, particularly where metaphor piles on metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: images are inventive, multi-functional, and rarely redundant; most sentences carry character, world, and theme simultaneously. The prose approaches density limits but avoids true purple excess; metaphors like “a silence so complete it circled around to music” are striking yet legible. Rhythm and variation keep momentum in a textural, lyric mode. A few moments flirt with overpacked metaphor chains, but they don’t materially obscure sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent (“wings folding like prayers nobody taught them,” “frost…like tiny white nooses”) and rarely feels overwrought. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; rhythm and paragraphing sustain momentum right through closure. I see no loops or artifacts that obscure sense or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically controlled, and information-dense, with many doing double duty for setting and emotion. Recurring metaphors (braids, lattices, music) are coherent and extended rather than piled-on at random. However, the figurative language is nearly continuous, so a few places (“fossilized moonlight,” “ear nested in her chest,” “colony of bioluminescent insects”) risk edging toward purple simply by accumulation. Trimming one or two metaphors in high-pressure beats would sharpen impact without sacrificing beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, densely meaningful, and largely pull triple duty (world-building, theme, and plot) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with few if any mixed metaphors, and the rhythm suits a contemplative, lyric piece. A couple of phrases (“algorithm of absence,” “seed crystal trying to nucleate a world”) push toward conceptual over-saturation, slightly slowing momentum in the middle. Still, clarity remains intact through the climax and final image, so any “purple” tendencies are minor rather than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously—and the rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; metaphors extend a small, coherent set of motifs (salt, glass, coral, taste) rather than spinning off randomly. There are no obvious loops, syntactic templates, or clarity breakdowns at the climax or ending. A few lines verge on purple by stacking abstractions (“stored remorse,” “emotional residue”), but they remain legible and do not blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet purposeful; most sentences do double or triple duty in world-building, mood, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and non-contradictory, with some especially sharp phrases (“borrowed starlight,” “a missing rib,” “apron glittering with metallic dust”). There is minimal redundancy or scaffold and no syntactic clutter that obscures causality or the closing image. The only restraint on a higher score is that the unrelenting lushness edges toward saturation, slightly muting contrast between calmer and peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is inventive and high-density, with most sentences performing multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Metaphor use is heavy but largely coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed or self-contradictory images. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; the piece moves forward rather than circling. The only drag is that the unrelenting lushness may slightly blur impact in peak beats for some readers, keeping it a notch below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is dense and controlled: images are specific (“a swimmer along a frozen wave”), and most sentences do multiple jobs without padding. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent rather than purple, and there’s no noticeable synonym loop or scaffolding. Momentum tracks cleanly through long, ornate sentences because causality remains easy to follow. A few lines verge on ornamental abstraction (“whisper that tasted of iron and childhood”), but they don’t materially slow or confuse the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: sentences are varied, information-dense, and nearly every image does double duty for atmosphere and theme (“the sound of sorrow learning it can also be comfort”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; metaphors (cracks as constellations, wing-shaped fracture) fit the established logic of the world. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose flows with strong read-aloud rhythm. The density and lyricism heighten rather than blur the crucial closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, with clean syntax, strong verbs, and high information density—nearly every line does atmospheric or thematic work. However, figurative language and thematic restatement are heavy and somewhat repetitive (multiple near-variants of “beauty in the difficult,” “endings contain beginnings,” “positions transform through sacrifice”), which creates a mild sense of over-writing and momentum drag. Several sentences could be tightened without loss of meaning, particularly in the final third where the piece circles its thesis. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and there are no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme) with few redundancies; the read-aloud rhythm is varied and propulsive. Figurative language is rich and generally coherent (e.g., “fireworks stitched bright scars across the sky”), with minimal cliché. However, metaphor density is extreme in places, risking purple-prose saturation and slightly blurring emphasis at peak beats. Tightening 5–10% of the imagery would likely sharpen impact without changing content.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and metaphor-heavy but controlled; most images do more than one job by advancing character, world, and theme simultaneously (“Seed breathes; tide thinks; I must move without disturbing either”). There are no significant loops or scaffold sentences, and information density stays high with very little dead weight. A few turns (“olfactorily sensitive”; repeated “undercurrent of wisdom”) skirt self-consciousness, but they do not muddy sense or closure. The final paragraphs, especially the image of “serenity no longer a goal but a companion,” land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with meaning, often doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and motion) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and in-family, avoiding mixed imagery that would blur sense. Momentum holds despite the lushness; syntactic variety and strategic paragraphing keep the piece from bogging down. It flirts with purple but remains controlled and legible, especially through the inversion sequence and at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is dense, purposeful, and largely free of scaffolding; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world logic, or Mara’s stance. Images like “the port had been a living organ…now it was a fossilized lung” are strong and legible, and the pattern of wind/organ/body metaphors is consistent rather than muddled. There is some risk of overload—many sentences carry figurative weight—but repetition avoids loops and the syntax remains clear through the climax. Slight pruning of metaphor density in a few spots could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional coloration (“his heartbeat left his chest and orbited him like a cautious moon” is a strong example). Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and the sequence of images is generally clear despite their density. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, with a few metaphors bordering on over-packed, which risks softening momentum and could be pared slightly for maximum sharpness in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Metaphors are original and coherent, and while they cluster thickly, they usually clarify rather than blur (“canyon hush drank light the way dry earth drinks blood” both explains and charges the scene). There’s a mild risk of over-lushness, but clarity and momentum hold, especially through the seam-opening and final renunciation. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final image is sharp, not smothered.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is dense but disciplined: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the metaphors stay within a coherent field (printing, mathematics, light). Rhythm alternates effectively between long, flowing constructions and shorter, decisive lines at moments of choice, giving the piece momentum despite its lyricism. There is a high ratio of figurative language, yet metaphors rarely mix or contradict, and clarity of action is preserved throughout the climax. Nothing crucial is summarized away, and the final paragraphs land with a precise, uncluttered image rather than purple flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: rhythmic variation, few wasted sentences, and many images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, metaphor density is very high, with repeated conceptual pairings (memory → myth, wonder → routine, germinate, sympathetic vibration) sometimes restated rather than freshly advanced. Phrases like “weight of becoming” and “fertile soil between what was and what might yet be” edge toward purple and explanatory, diluting immediacy. Trimming a few redundant thematic formulations would sharpen the existing good work.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; sentences carry multiple jobs (advancing action, worldbuilding, and theme) with high information density. Metaphors are generally coherent and fresh (“steering wheel spinning like a galaxy,” “mist into a thousand tiny mirrors”), and rhythm varies well. There is a risk of figurative overload in places, but it doesn’t blur sense or stall momentum, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. Line-level craft is publishable; minor trimming of figurative density in the midsection could make it even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is lush yet mostly efficient: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and plot, and there’s a pleasing variety in sentence length and structure. Figurative language is frequent but thematically unified around weaving, time, and organic matter; metaphors rarely feel mixed or confusing. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and causality remains clear even in highly compressed lyric passages. The only restraint is that in a few spots the density edges toward purple, risking reader fatigue in a high-pressure market that often prefers slightly leaner prose.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are mostly clear, syntactic variety is healthy, and nearly every line advances either world, theme, or character. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent (“floating arches… once been grounded stone,” “space between understanding and confusion”) and follows a tight conceptual palette of gravity, rubble, light, and song. There is some repetition of key phrases and a mild tendency toward abstraction in late paragraphs, yet it reads as patterned rather than as scaffold or synonym churn. The final images (silk as flags, hammer as rhythm of awakenings) close the loop with good sonic and imagistic control.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is high-level: sentences are varied, information-dense, and typically do two or three jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, theme). Metaphoric motifs (loom, threads, mass, vibration) are coherent rather than mixed, and they intensify toward the end. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every line is figurative—but the rhythm and clarity hold, and there are no evident scaffold or synonym loops. Line-level craft supports momentum instead of stalling it, particularly around the locker and note sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (setting, mood, character) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with images extending the same atmospheric logic rather than competing. Rhythm shifts appropriately, with long, winding sentences for reflection and tighter ones around key beats (“A stone clicked overhead, the smallest sound, like a heartbeat slipping into place.”). I see no scaffold, loops, or metaphoric muddle that dulls clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and motion), and there’s little evident scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language is often striking (“whale remembering harpoons forged from obsolete type,” “ocean of post-newsprint silence”) and usually clear. That said, the near-constant metaphor and high-concept diction create a persistently “turned up to eleven” texture that can slightly blunt impact by offering few plainer beats for contrast. A bit more modulation or selective simplicity in key emotional moments could sharpen the most important images.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density—images often do double duty for worldbuilding and theme (e.g., “a dragon teaching philosophy to stones” both enriches setting and characterizes the kind of stories she attracts). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent; repetitions like “quietly explosive” and “valley-mist wonder” feel like motifs rather than loops. There is some risk of over-saturation of abstractions (“narrative magnetism,” “story-ways”) but they remain legible and don’t materially obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: images like “mirrors cracked into constellations of sorrow” and “moonlight poured through the fractures, refracting into spectral trees” carry both sense and emotional charge. Sentences vary in length and structure, propelling the piece without loops or obvious scaffolding. While the density of figurative language is high, it remains coherent and pattern-consistent, rarely tipping into muddle or redundancy. The final paragraphs, in particular, land with clarity and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid, compressed, and mostly purposeful; many sentences handle image, world-building, and theme in one move. However, figurative language is nearly continuous—moths, scabs, tuning forks, lanterns, etc.—so the texture occasionally borders on ornamental and risks reader fatigue, especially in the middle where new metaphors pile rapidly. There is little true scaffold or looping, and grammar and sequencing are clean, so momentum remains intact. A touch more variation between highly figurative and plainer lines would let the best images hit even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are vivid, syntactic variety is good, and most metaphors are apt and mutually reinforcing rather than mixed. The prose maintains high information density—each line tends to carry atmosphere, character, and theme at once. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise enough not to blur action or causality, and momentum through the high-pressure beat (midnight, Vale’s approach) is maintained. A few phrases (“enlarged tranquility,” “woman-shaped hush”) flirt with over-lushness but stop short of obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences carry character, atmosphere, and theme at once, and there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphors are fresh and controlled (“roses grew through mosaic gods,” “tiny green shoots wearing flakes of crust like name tags”) and rarely mix or blur sense. Rhythm varies well across long, sinuous lines and tighter cadences at key turns (e.g., the first frost, touching the mosaics, tasting ordinary bread), giving the piece momentum despite its reflective bent. A few abstractions (“absolution felt tenuous”) lean on concept language rather than image, but they don’t significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) without redundancy. Figurative language is dense but not incoherent; metaphors like vows as spectral frequencies and data on frozen mercury are internally consistent and grounded. There’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping, and the closure image is crisp, not muddied. The only restraint on a higher score is that the lushness occasionally edges toward saturation, risking reader fatigue, though it never fully tips into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing setting, emotion, and theme at once), and the prose reads cleanly without syntactic confusion or redundancy. Metaphors are vivid and largely well-chosen (“eastern sky bruised lavender,” “door that opened onto another door”), though the sustained figurative richness occasionally skirts purple, especially when multiple intense images cluster in one sentence. Momentum rarely stalls; even reflective lines tend to tilt the present choice. A slight trim of overlapping figurative beats could tighten the already compelling rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are well-formed, varied, and information-dense, with multi-purpose images (taste, weather, politics) doing a lot of work at once. Some metaphor stacking and repeated coinages (“futuristic nostalgia,” thematic explication) edge toward mild purple prose, but they don’t obscure sense or causality. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn; most sentences advance either atmosphere, character, or theme without redundancy. A slightly tighter final third—trimming explicit thematic explanation—would sharpen impact and lift the prose further.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is dense and purposeful: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, emotion, world-building) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the story reads smoothly aloud. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and grounded in recurring vocabularies (crystal, dawn, breath, sound), avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. There are no significant loops, template cadences, or grammatical stumbles; the progression of images remains clear into the closure beat. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the figurative density in spots edges close to purple and could arguably breathe more around a few pivotal emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are vivid, rhythms varied, and most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, theme, and emotional state). Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, and while the prose is lush, it stops short of purple; there are no significant loops or scaffolding redundancies. A couple of lines edge toward overt abstraction (e.g., “proving that even after the oasis dries, candor...can still irrigate a city”), but they don’t materially dull the closure image. Momentum holds from discovery through journey to cathedral and into the dawn exit.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but largely precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character at once). Metaphoric density is high, yet images are coherent and rarely mixed, and the syntax remains clear, so momentum is preserved despite the lyricism. There’s minor risk of over-saturation in phrases like “frequency of human wonder” and “symphony of truth,” but they are integrated into the conceptual frame rather than feeling tacked on. No significant loops, scaffolding, or rhythm artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, dense with information, and often do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“reality folding inward like petals closing at dusk”). Repetition of key phrases and structures supports the lyric, accumulative effect rather than feeling like scaffolding. Some diction clusters risk slight overrichness (many metaphorical constructions in close succession), and the final thematic sentence could be trimmed for sharper impact. Overall, momentum and clarity remain intact despite the high figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: the prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language recurs frequently (“the way sand waits for wind,” “darkness breathing”) yet remains coherent and thematically aligned, never tangling sense. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity breaks, and the final image lands cleanly. A very slight risk of over-saturation of simile keeps it just below the very top of the band.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: almost every sentence carries multiple functions (world, mood, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and metaphors are precise and internally coherent (“ghost-thrum of old power,” “voice braided with bubbles”). The rhythm varies well enough to avoid monotony, and there are no obvious loops, filter stacks, or mechanical patterns. There is, however, a very high density of figurative language across the whole piece; while mostly successful, the unrelenting lyricism risks softening impact in moments that could benefit from plainer force. Trimming a handful of ornamental flourishes would move this closer to flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: sentences are dense with information and image, yet generally easy to parse and free of scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent—gravity, weight, salt, light—so it reads as an intentional texture rather than purple excess. A few phrases edge toward abstraction (“gleaming silence,” “fabric of forgetting”) but remain grounded in the story’s physical vocabulary and do not obscure action or closure. Pacing is steady, with no redundant paragraphs or clotted exposition, supporting momentum through a largely contemplative scene.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rich and dense, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme, and the rhythm supports the ritualistic mood. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and grounded in the story’s established metaphoric lexicon (code, silence, celestial/mud imagery). There is mild purple-prose risk and a few near-redundancies of motif, yet clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and closure. With a bit of pruning for repetition, this could reach a rarer level of line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense yet disciplined, with most sentences doing double duty for image and meaning; metaphors are thematically aligned (grammar/architecture/astronomy) rather than ornamental. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; recurring phrases like “agreed upon lies” and “patiently nimble” are purposeful motifs, not redundancy. Rhythm is varied and the long sentences remain clear, avoiding figurative muddle even in peak beats like the tutor’s dissolution and the gargoyle’s first speech. Line-level craft easily meets elite-publication standards, with no artifacts that dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and musical, with strong verbs and vivid metaphors doing multiple jobs at once. Almost every sentence carries figurative weight, which edges toward excess but doesn’t significantly muddy clarity or causality. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the story advances with good momentum despite being image-rich. A slightly leaner ratio of metaphor to action, particularly mid-story, would make the peaks stand out even more.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-formed, sensory, and information-dense, and most carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious bloat. There is a degree of purple-prose risk and repetition—several lines reiterate the same conceptual ground about vengeance, unfinished stories, and calibrated treason—which slightly blunts momentum. The unfinished “confession of a” sentence reads as an editing artifact rather than a purposeful stylistic choice, marring an otherwise potent image. Trimming a few redundant abstractions and resolving that fragment would lift the piece toward elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and image-dense but remarkably controlled: metaphors (moths weaving sound, tunnels like “sentences too honest to speak aloud”) are consistent with the sonic/textual conceit and don’t collapse into mixed imagery. Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, interiority, and thematic seeding—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There is a borderline risk of purple prose in spots, yet clarity and momentum remain intact, including at closure. A touch more spareness at a few peaks could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is dense and polished: metaphors are inventive yet generally coherent, and sentences often carry multiple layers of information (world, mood, theme) without obvious padding. There is some risk of purple prose given the constant figurative texture, but cadence and image choice mostly justify the lushness. Repetition feels intentional rather than scaffolded, and there are no obvious loops or syntactic templates dragging momentum. The final images in particular are clean and potent, free of muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled: most sentences do more than one job, braiding physical action, atmosphere, and interior meaning (“A sailor had once asked… she answered that mending was a conversation with water, a way to memorize the shape of absence”). Figurative language is frequent yet thematically coherent—spirals, nets, patterns, paths—and avoids mixed metaphors or muddle. There are no evident scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops; momentum holds despite lyric richness. A few phrases flirt with purple, but they don’t blur clarity or undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense yet generally multi-functional, combining worldbuilding, mood, and forward motion without much redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely clean and purposeful, with few strained or mixed metaphors; images like the “milk-white” diamond with a “black spear…shaped like a question mark” are both clear and thematically apt. Momentum holds across the paragraph-long descriptive passages because each adds a precise new step or realization. The main constraint on a higher score is that the constant high figurative register slightly flattens contrast—some simpler, more direct lines at peak stress could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, evocative metaphors that usually earn their keep, and very little scaffolding or repetition. Phrases like “grittily whimsical ghost in every machine” and “cobalt glass shards” do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, tone, and theme—without bogging momentum. There is some risk of figurative overload, with abstractions (“dawn,” “shadows,” “prophecy”) repeated enough to edge toward purple in places, but clarity at the climax and closure remains intact. A touch more pruning of concept-heavy restatements would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and often do multiple jobs at once, sustaining momentum despite a reflective mode. Figurative language is frequent but usually apt and legible, with only occasional borderline purple moments (“glowed, projecting faint holographic letters”) that might benefit from trimming. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; almost every line carries either image, character, or theme. The slight deduction reflects the high metaphor density, which could start to feel self-conscious in a venue expecting absolute restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and efficient in advancing atmosphere, worldbuilding, and stakes; most sentences are doing multiple jobs. The figurative language is often striking (“sunset bled across the horizon like a wound healing in reverse,” “notes spilled out like warm blood”), and rhythm varies enough to keep it from feeling mechanical. That said, the density of metaphors and repeated salt/iron/whale-song textures occasionally edges toward purple and risks numbing impact, especially in the mid-to-late stretch. Clarity remains intact, but some trimming or strategic plainer lines would likely elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is remarkably controlled: nearly every sentence carries dual weight for image and meaning without slipping into muddled or mixed metaphor. Figurative language remains thematically unified around cold, magnetism, mapping, and breath, and the rare precise numbers (every forty-three seconds) feel purposeful, not decorative. There are no noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences; variation in syntax keeps the lyricism from congealing into purple prose. If anything, a couple of highly textured lines edge toward luxuriant, but clarity and momentum never truly suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and generally do more than one job (image, mood, and information in tandem). Metaphors are largely coherent and thematically apt, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn; progression through the paragraphing is smooth. Reflection is anchored clearly in concrete triggers (lantern flicker, journal touch) and doesn’t stall momentum. A few metaphors are somewhat familiar, but they don’t materially blur or slow the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is highly polished, with strong rhythmic control, varied sentence structures, and high information density—most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding + theme, or image + emotion). Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful (“time recycled, penance mechanical”; “coins flung into a dark well”), with only minor risk of overlushness. There is little redundancy or scaffolding; beats move cleanly from one to the next without explanatory padding. The figurative density in a few spots flirts with purple but does not obscure sense or blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally sharp, information-dense, and free of scaffolding; nearly every line contributes to world, character, or thematic motif. Figurative language is rich but mostly coherent and anchored in the story’s mechanical-organic lexicon (“throbbed like a mechanical heart,” “sung in a chord that tasted of copper and ozone”). There is some risk of over-saturation, with many sentences heavily adorned, which edges toward purple but does not yet blur sense or momentum. Syntax and paragraphing are varied enough that the piece reads with good propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for setting, theme, and mood (“absence felt louder,” “grief-clicks”). Repetition of key words and motifs (“absence,” “deleted files,” “73”) reads as purposeful pattern rather than scaffold. A few metaphors verge on the ornate, but they remain coherent and aligned with the technological/astral lexicon. There is little padding or paraphrase looping; each sentence tends to advance either plot or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and images that generally do more than one job (worldbuilding plus theme, or mood plus stakes). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and legible; there are few if any true mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops. A couple of phrases verge on purple or redundant (“weighted breath before reply” echoed, some stacked abstractions about empathy and protocol), which slightly slows momentum in the thematic explanation beats. Tightening 2–3 of the most ornate or expository sentences would elevate the piece to a cleaner, more austere high-literary finish.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and image-dense yet generally precise, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (e.g., the horn note that “folded the air like linen”). Information density is high and there’s very little scaffolding; nearly every sentence contributes to patterning sound, ice, and patience. However, metaphor frequency and ornateness are close to the upper limit—phrases like “a chime thinner than moonlight, a sound that tasted of salt and lullabies” flirt with purple—and a few key concepts (“fold in patience”) are repeated often enough to feel slightly overinsisted. These are matters of fine-tuning rather than structural weakness, but they keep the line-level craft shy of the most rarefied band.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character, and recurring metaphors (fermentation, grafting, light) are generally coherent. There is a tendency toward saturation—nearly every line reaches for figurative language—which risks purple prose and occasionally slows momentum. A bit more pruning of abstractions and metaphor-stacking would sharpen impact, but closure remains clear and undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, information-dense, and often do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Recurrent constructions (“paradox of movement beneath stillness,” “raw substance of understanding that precedes language”) edge toward abstraction and mild purple, but they do not obscure causality or the closing image. Rhythm varies sufficiently, and there are no evident loops or scaffolding sentences. A slight trim of conceptual phrasing in favor of embodied detail would likely elevate it further for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and rich with multi-tasking sentences that advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. There are no serious clarity issues or scaffolding loops; momentum carries cleanly to the final image. However, the high frequency of elaborate metaphors and personifications (“autumn lips,” “forgiveness practicing its vows,” “footprints that spelled… in cursive only bees can read”) edges into purple, sometimes diluting sharpness. A touch more austerity in key beats would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong images, varied syntax, and generally high information density; most sentences do multiple jobs (setting mood, advancing action, and revealing character). Occasional repetitions (“She had…” / “She began…”) and a few mildly purple phrases flirt with over-lyricism but don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned, particularly around dust, breath, and growth, with no mixed-metaphor confusion. The final paragraphs land cleanly, with a precise, resonant close on “zygote” and the new “spine.”

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, fresh imagery (“fog rose and dissolved like breath made visible,” “metallic on his tongue like the flavor of aging itself”), and generally purposeful sentences with minimal scaffolding. A few phrases or constructions repeat (“He began arranging driftwood…” after we’ve just been told he discovered this; some similar cadence in describing decay and fog), and the figurative density skirts purple but mostly holds. Trimming minor redundancies and one or two over-articulated metaphors would bring it closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry high information density, often performing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious padding, and the rhythm breathes where it needs to. Metaphors are mostly precise and consonant with the story’s imagery clusters (optics, time, sound, gravity), and sequencing remains clear even under heavy figurative load. There is some flirtation with purple prose and repetition of key phrases, but it reads as intentional motif rather than artifact and does not obscure the closure beat. A slight trim of stacked modifiers in a few lines would lift this into fully elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, tone, character) with little scaffolding, and rhythm modulates well between long, lush description and short, declarative beats at moments of change (“and then he was still”). Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and thematically aligned; nothing crucial is obscured by purple prose or mixed metaphors. There are no obvious loops, synonym churn, or structural artifacts, and micro-movements are almost entirely purposeful. The slight risk is a near-uniform lushness that occasionally edges toward over-saturation, but it doesn’t materially drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but mostly purposeful, with high information per sentence and images that usually do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme). Recurrent metaphors of spoons, silk, loops, and shadows create a cohesive texture rather than a random flourish; rhythm shifts appropriately as pressure mounts. At times the figurative load risks purple-ness and there are a few near-redundant formulations, particularly in the closing moralizing lines, which slightly blunt momentum and subtlety. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is highly figurative yet controlled, with most metaphors (“turning the changeling's baby tooth between her fingers like a dim star”; “constellations instead of scars”) doing multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there are no significant paraphrase loops or syntactic templates that drag momentum. A few images edge toward purple or over-packed abstraction (“nostalgic innovation,” “lantern in the ribs of the world”), slightly blurring immediacy but not obscuring sense or closure. Overall, information density and clarity remain strong despite the ornamental surface.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and metaphor chains are controlled and on-theme (light, tide, cloth, breath). The prose largely avoids redundancy and scaffolding; progression from image to image feels deliberate rather than padded. There is some density of figuration that edges close to purple (“zephyr bloom cool, a breeze made visible, soft petals of luminance”) and a few slightly ornate constructions that could be trimmed for maximal sharpness in an elite market. Nonetheless, clarity, rhythm, and propulsion remain intact, especially around the climactic transformation and closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich but mostly avoids true purple; images like “captions glowing like frost” or the USB as a “locket” do multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythms vary and maintain forward motion despite the lyricism, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A couple of metaphor stacks (“wound…taste like metal,” “graft new meaning,” “rust spread to her tongue”) flirt with over-saturation but remain coherent within the botanical/industrial palette. Line-level craft supports rather than obscures the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm and length, images are often doing double duty for setting and psychology, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent with the world (mist as marginalia, fog as quotation marks, the shell becoming a lighthouse) and rarely muddies sense. The prose advances action and interiority simultaneously; nearly every line earns its keep. The only restraint is that density of metaphor in a few stretches could risk numbing impact in an ultra-competitive venue, but it doesn’t significantly harm clarity or momentum here.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and dense with information that often does double duty (worldbuilding and emotion, or theme and action). Images like “orange light bleeding through the arbor's canopy like liquid fire” and “pollen that now glowed like captured starlight” are vivid without usually tipping into muddle. There is some repetition (“spun golden stories”) and a touch of purple/expository excess in the thematic statements, which slightly slows momentum in places. Still, there are no serious loops or artifacts, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is lush, image-dense, and largely precise; many sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, and theme) without feeling clotted. Rhythm is well-controlled, with long, flowing sentences suited to the “moving stillness” concept and occasional shorter beats for emphasis (e.g., “He knew he would never leave”). There is mild risk of purple prose and metaphor saturation, and a few repetitions (“demonstrating patience physically,” variants of “while the world holds its breath”) could be trimmed without loss. Nonetheless, clarity holds and the final images land cleanly and powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense with figurative language but generally precise and non-redundant; images usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without muddling sense. Lines like “a hollow too smooth for any file, as though an echo had worn it away by rattling forever in one stunned instant” show high information density and clean logic. A few phrases skirt purple (“wounded season’s last sun,” “tailored skin”) but remain coherent and earned in context. Momentum holds throughout; there are no significant loops, scaffolding, or metaphor clashes to dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense with imagery, but most metaphors are coherent, mutually reinforcing, and multipurpose (advancing atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotion simultaneously). Sentences generally carry high information density without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops, and the sequence of actions remains clear even in lyrical passages. There is a touch of purple richness in places, yet it stops short of obscuring sense or bogging momentum, particularly since the piece isn’t a high-tempo scene. A bit more sparing use of figurative language around peak beats could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing double duty for atmosphere and emotional advance. Figurative language (“sawdust and thunder,” “steam ghosting the loft”) is rich but mostly coherent, with only a slight risk of saturation rather than true purple excess. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding sentences, or syntactic templates dragging momentum. The final sentences in particular have clear cadence and image logic, allowing the closure to land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm supports an accumulating, dreamlike pressure. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and apt; there’s little sense of metaphor churn or mixed vehicles undermining clarity. A few lines flirt with abstraction (“the last uneroded gear that still remembered spin,” “emulsified dreams”) but remain anchored enough in prior images not to feel like purple drift. The closure paragraph is especially clean, with no artifacts muddying the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is rich and high-density, with many lines doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“Each weld she improvised was a stanza in a grammar of reclamation…”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, and sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and action order remains clear despite the lyricism. The only constraint on an even higher score is that the lushness occasionally skirts purple, risking reader saturation in a few adjacent metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are musical, images concrete, and most lines do more than one job (world-building, mood, and interiority intertwined). The figurative language is dense but largely coherent and thematically aligned, with few mixed metaphors. However, repeated constructions and phrases (“excruciatingly gentle,” “petrichor nostalgia,” “glacial hush”) create a slight sense of echo and minor overwrite that could be tightened without loss. Momentum holds despite the lyricism, and the final images land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, information-dense, and usually do two or three jobs at once (advancing plot, revealing character, carrying motif). Metaphoric language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful (“the canal as nothing more than a scar trying to heal,” the bunker as “a whale that had mistaken war for ocean”). There is a mild risk of saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image—which can verge on purple for an ultra-demanding venue, but clarity and momentum remain intact. I see no serious artifacts, loops, or muddled figures that touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush and metaphor-rich yet largely avoids muddle; images like “brittle rosary of sky-fire” and “oceanic hush” are vivid, precise, and multi-tasking. Sentence rhythm varies well, carrying momentum even through descriptive passages, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffold phrasing. A few lines come close to purple, but they remain legible and purposeful rather than self-indulgent, and crucial beats (the bead cracking, the seed planting, the final dawn image) are especially clear. Figurative language is consistent in its maritime and material logic, so it enhances rather than obscures cause/effect or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and very few redundant or scaffolding sentences; most lines do at least two jobs (imagery plus theme, or world plus emotion). Metaphors are generally clear, grounded in the story’s fabric (carpet, thread, shadows) and rarely feel mixed. There is some risk of purple-leaning abstraction in clusters—especially around the thematic lexicon of presence/absence and healing—which slightly dulls the sharpness of individual images. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the final paragraphs land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, inventive metaphors, and very few wasted sentences. The prose consistently does multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, psychology, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. However, figurative language is nearly continuous; the saturation occasionally risks blur and reader fatigue in what could be higher-pressure moments. Despite that, imagery remains coherent and the closure image (“the fall itself might be the first spread of wings”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are mostly precise, sentences do multiple jobs, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and thematically aligned (fire/ash/lagoon/bruise systems), with little in the way of mixed metaphors. The rhythm moves well from long, sinuous sentences to shorter emphatic beats at key turns (“keep going,” “fighting fire with growth”). The main restraint keeping this from the very top is occasional near-purple phrasing that states theme a bit baldly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically aware, and dense with meaning; almost every line advances image, world, or internal state. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and reinforcing rather than muddled; the few overt labels (“constellation of regrets”) still work within the piece’s register. There is some patterning that borders on list-like (the sequence of named fountains) and a mild sense of conceptual repetition, yet it doesn’t stall momentum or blur cause/effect. The final lines, especially the redefinition of the hush, land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are coherent and multi-functional, and almost every line advances both mood and meaning. Figurative language is dense but generally disciplined; recurring motifs (petals, gear, infinity, light/fire) stay internally consistent and avoid mixed metaphors. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence carries imagery—but it doesn’t materially obscure cause/effect or the closure image, so the piece reads as lush rather than bloated.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, weaving atmosphere, theme, and action in most sentences. Repetition of certain constructions and phrases (“each poem traded at dinner,” explicit thematic restatements) creates a mild sense of looped emphasis that could be tightened. A few lines veer into explanatory abstraction rather than image-driven feeling, dulling momentum in the back half. Still, there are no serious clarity errors, and many images (poem-shrouded chrysalises, poem-titled headstones) are striking and cleanly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and information-rich, with many sentences doing triple duty (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) while maintaining clarity and forward motion. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically coherent (metal, sea, debt, breath); lines like “obsidian ridge glowing like a blade turned away from flesh” are both clear and precise. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. The only risk is bordering on purple in places, but it never quite tips into obscuring meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-by-line, the writing is polished, with high information density and sentences that usually carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and thematically coherent (spirals, thresholds, games, planting), and action remains clear despite the lushness. There are occasional moments of near-purple density where two or three metaphors stack in close proximity, which could be trimmed for even greater sharpness and momentum. Still, there are no real artifacts, loops, or muddles; the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight despite their complexity, with good information density and multiple jobs per line (worldbuilding, theme, and image at once). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and purposeful, and the read-aloud rhythm is pleasing. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual stacking (“children skating on equations, lovers carving their initials into equations that would cure their children's children's diseases”) that can momentarily blur focus. Still, clarity at closure is intact, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding artifacts dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (world-building, mood, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and there are no loops or redundant restatements. The figurative language is rich but generally coherent and on-theme; images like “mist curled like forgotten sheet music” or “a tiny green planet still spinning tales” are precise and legible. At times, the density of metaphors per paragraph skirts purple, which slightly blunts momentum in what might otherwise be the sharpest high-pressure beats. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final cadence lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is lush, with many sentences doing double or triple duty—advancing action, evoking setting, and layering theme (“creating a path that leads nowhere and everywhere simultaneously”). Rhythm varies and the piece largely avoids paraphrase loops or scaffolding; grammar and clarity are clean. That said, figurative language is very dense, especially in the final third, risking minor overload and occasional near-redundancy (multiple ash/powder/crystal equivalences) that could be sharpened. A slight trim in metaphor count would likely heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is packed with information and image, doing double duty for worldbuilding and psychology in most sentences (“competing narratives…were not accidents but ballast” is a prime example). Figurative language is consistent in motif (gears, tides, sediment) rather than scattershot, so the lyricism feels patterned instead of purple. There are minor spots where imagery stacks (“sedimentary layers of the sunken lower districts, prying slate tablets from silt”) that could be trimmed for breath, but they don’t obscure cause-effect or the closure beat. No clear loops or scaffolding artifacts drag momentum at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious redundancy, and imagery tends to be precise rather than generic. Motifs like velvet, silence, and braiding recur with clear variations that avoid simple restatement. The main constraint on an even higher score is that the prose occasionally skirts the edge of purple—nearly every line is metaphorically charged—so there’s minimal use of plain statement as contrast, which can slightly blur emphasis. Still, clarity at closure is fully intact and there are no discernible scaffolds, loops, or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but disciplined: metaphors are specific (“a tiny heart that had memorized every encyclopedia of flavor”) and rarely feel mixed or overextended. Almost every sentence does double work—advancing atmosphere, world-building, and theme simultaneously—without obvious scaffold or repetition. There is minimal syntactic monotony, and punctuation supports a graceful read-aloud rhythm. A few phrases verge on purple, but they do not obscure clarity or blunt the closure image, so they register as style rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is unusually strong: sentences are information-dense, multipurpose, and largely free of scaffold or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is rich but patterned and coherent (nectar, bees, lightning, coins), avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle even in peak beats. A few images (“proboscis,” “nectar dusk”) push toward lush, but the consistency of the motif set keeps them from feeling purple. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and the final paragraphs land with crisp, memorable images rather than explanatory summary.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently high-caliber, with sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, tone, and thematic hinting—while remaining largely clear. Imagery is inventive and often striking (“petrified waves” of wallpaper, “assembling a confession from pronouns”), and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. The main limitation is density: figurative language is frequent enough that a demanding editor might occasionally wish for more plain scaffolding to vary texture and preserve ease of reading. Nonetheless, the line-level craft remains controlled and rarely feels muddled or gratuitously ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy, and metaphor chains stay within an aquatic/stone/memory logic. Rhythm varies nicely, with long, sinuous lines for atmosphere and shorter ones around key choices (“I am learning.”). The prose skates close to density in spots, but it rarely feels purple because images are precise and motivated. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences that stall momentum, and the closure image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, image-rich, and purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some high metaphor density, but images are coherent and non-redundant, and there are no significant scaffold or synonym loops; rhythm varies nicely across longer, winding lines and sharper, emphatic beats. Syntax remains clear even when concepts are abstract (“counting backwards from infinity, daring the staircase to follow her into negative steps”), and the final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle. A tiny trim of decorative phrasing in the midsection could increase propulsion, but current momentum is strong for elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, densely imagistic, and multifunctional, often advancing setting, character, and theme at once (“a match struck in a library” is both sound and conceptual charge). There is heavy use of metaphor, but it remains legible and largely unmuddled, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. A few images skirt purple-prose excess (e.g., “peat and saffron quiet,” “leaves of lost languages stuck to her shoes”) yet they’re coherent within the established style and don’t obscure causality or closure. Overall momentum holds, with almost every sentence earning its keep in this short length.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally elegant and dense with meaning—objects and metaphors (waterfall, bread, bees, opera glass) do multiple jobs without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Sentences are mostly clean, with strong verbs and purposeful modifiers; there are few, if any, mechanical or grammatical slips. The main limitation is a tendency toward richness in nearly every line, which edges close to purple in spots and contributes to the occasional thematic overstatement. Still, momentum holds, and the final images land clearly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but controlled; nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, atmosphere, and plot) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Imagery (“hourglass dripping in reverse,” the yoyo as missing escapement) is fresh and internally coherent, and rhythm supports escalation toward the time-fold moment. Recurrent phrases work as motifs rather than redundancy, and there are no figurative muddles or clarity failures at the climax. This is line-level work that would be competitive in top literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is rich and information-dense; most sentences do double duty in advancing setting and interiority, with relatively little dead scaffolding. Metaphors are abundant but largely coherent and thematically linked to reflection, decay, and artificial light (e.g., “roadkill can look jeweled beneath headlights”), creating a purposeful pattern rather than random ornament. There is some risk of saturation in the sheer density of figurative language, which slightly blurs sharpness in a few spots, but clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and closure. Syntax and grammar are clean, and the final images land with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is high: most sentences do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, mood, concept), and the figurative language is generally coherent and fresh. Refrains like “restless euphony” and “fractal generating” function as motifs rather than mere repetition, and there is little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose does flirt with purple in places, with image-density so high that some beats risk blurring rather than sharpening pressure. Nonetheless, clarity holds at closure, and the final paragraph in particular balances rhythm and sense with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled and coherent; metaphors (“like a warning spelled in Morse,” “like a held breath”) reinforce the pattern-language motif rather than clash. Rhythm varies well across long, sinuous lines and tighter, punchy turns (“The watchers stirred.”). It edges toward purple in places, but clarity and momentum remain intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme) with high information density and varied rhythm. The imagery (“ivy tightening its slow green edit”) is vivid and thematically apt without tipping into incoherent purple prose. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose sustains momentum despite a reflective tilt. A few metaphor-rich moments in the middle are dense but remain clear and do not muddy the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and high-density, with many images doing double duty for mood and theme (“a hush of arches and moonlit ribs,” “a secret bruise”), and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. Sentences vary in length and cadence, and the line-level clarity remains strong despite the figurative load; action order is always discernible. There is a mild risk of over-ornamentation—almost every line carries metaphor—which occasionally edges toward purple without quite tipping over. Trimming one or two of the more decorative comparisons would sharpen the already strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but mostly do multiple jobs at once—advancing scene, deepening character, and building atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically aligned (ink as bruise, streets as subject headings, water as erasure), and the prose’s musicality passes a read-aloud test. Momentum is maintained despite lyric richness; key turns are given crisp, unornamented lines for contrast (“She extinguished the lantern.” “She relit the lantern…”). The main constraint on a higher score is that the sustained metaphorical density occasionally risks saturation, where one or two images could be trimmed to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is lush yet efficient; nearly every sentence advances image, world, and emotion simultaneously, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are inventive and largely coherent, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony despite many long sentences. There is mild risk of saturation (figurative language is dense throughout), which may slightly blur a few images (“galaxy of unfinished bedtime stories” plus constellations plus cranes-as-lamps crowds the same semantic field). Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final lines land cleanly without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, with many images doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (e.g., geode dust tasting like wedding cake), and the rhythms vary enough to keep momentum. Metaphor is generally disciplined and on-theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. At times the figurative load approaches saturation, which slightly risks numbing impact, but it never quite tips into muddle or obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently strong: sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) with relatively little scaffolding, and imagery like “brilliant dimness” and “hands that trembled perpetually surprised” is vivid without collapsing into incoherence. Rhythm varies well, and there are few, if any, true loops or filler lines; most sentences advance either atmosphere or stakes. A slight tendency toward repeated motifs and phrases (“frequencies,” “perpetually surprised eyes,” “belonging”) verges on over-insistence but stops short of true purple prose or drag. Line-level craft supports rather than obscures the closure image of Mara turning toward the stars.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: dense but purposeful metaphors, minimal scaffolding, and strong verbs with few redundancies. Some figurative choices edge toward purple or slightly overworked (“sieved hush poured over the raw wound of someone’s lacking past,” “a second heart that had learned to beat true”), though they remain intelligible and thematically aligned. Sentences vary in length and structure, maintaining momentum despite the reflective mode. There are no significant clarity issues, loops, or mechanical errors to undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, mood, character) with vivid yet coherent figurative language. There is some density of metaphor and abstraction—“borrowed bone,” “squid grief,” “floating splinter between wrath and remorse”—but it rarely muddies concrete action or causality. A few lines in the final paragraph slide toward explanatory generalization rather than image-driven implication, softening the sharpness of the last beat. Overall, rhythm, clarity, and specificity hold; minor purple-leaning moments do not seriously impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences carry setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously—and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and legible, avoiding mixed metaphors or true purple overgrowth. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and syntax remains clear even in more baroque lines. The only minor drawback is sheer density of imagery in every sentence, which risks saturation but doesn’t materially obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is dense and inventive, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“birth announcements whispered between lines, waiting for other seekers to breathe them warm”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, rarely muddling sense. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy; each beat pushes forward rather than circling. A few metaphors verge on richness for richness’s sake, but they don’t materially impede clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose maintains high information density—almost every line carries world-building, emotion, and thematic work at once—without slipping into incoherence. Metaphors are fresh and largely non-conflicting, and repetition feels patterned (“fire remembers everything,” spices, moons) rather than accidental. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; progression is continuous and rhythmic. The lyrical richness skirts purple in a couple of lines but never muddles cause/effect or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rich and information-dense, with many sentences doing triple duty for character, world, and theme, and there are few true redundancies or scaffolding lines. Most metaphors are coherent within the established lexicon of clouds, porcelain, and time, and they propel rather than stall the reading experience. However, figurative density is so high that a few moments verge on over-saturation, and the repeated nonstandard “unfasten” in narrative rather than dialogue feels like an avoidable copy slip at this echelon. These are minor enough not to harm closure but keep the piece just short of pristine line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and metaphor-rich but largely avoids muddle; images are coherent and purposeful, and nearly every line pulls weight for character, theme, and atmosphere. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax is varied enough to keep momentum. A few phrases flirt with purple (“time folded into mercy,” “vines of light”) yet remain legible and thematically apt rather than overwrought. No loops or artifacts significantly blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and very few clunky constructions or true redundancies. That said, figurative language is extremely dense—nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction—which edges into overwriting and can slightly blur impact. The repeated, heavily explained final clause about “the texture of transformation” exemplifies this tendency to over-clarify what the images already imply. Tighter selection of metaphors and one fewer explanatory flourish at the end would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-by-line, the piece is polished: sentences vary in length and structure, information density is high, and nearly every line carries character, world, or tension. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (light, ink, breath, locks), avoiding mixed metaphors that would muddy sense. A few phrases (“winking hush,” “gently inventive earth”) flirt with over-richness, yet they don’t stall momentum or obscure action. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or grammatical slips, though a touch more spareness in a couple of mid-scene descriptions could further sharpen the pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is dense but controlled, with recurring images (borrowed dawn, singing star dust, equations in light) that reinforce rather than clutter. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and grammar/usage are clean. The only limitation is that the consistently elevated register sometimes smooths over sharpness of individual moments, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops, and the read-aloud rhythm is varied and intentional. Figurative language is lush but generally controlled; motifs recur in purposeful ways (mask/stone, scars/maps, timer/vigil) rather than as decorative churn. Syntax is clean, with no tense slips or pronoun ambiguity, and causality is never obscured by the lyricism. A touch of metaphor saturation keeps it just under the very top band, but clarity and propulsion survive intact.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many lines doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“this was not sport but syntax”). Figurative language is mostly precise and apt, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the piece maintains momentum despite its reflective lean. A few phrases flirt with mild purple (“a blade not yet drawn,” “dignified chaos”) but do not obscure clarity or closure. Sentence-level control is strong enough for high-tier venues with only light tightening needed, if any.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but highly efficient: most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building plus character, or image plus theme) with minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent; metaphors partner rather than collide, and there’s no notable synonym churn or template cadence. A few phrases (“beauty clawed itself from anarchy,” “blooming resistance”) skate close to purple, but they’re anchored in repeated motifs and on-page action, so they land as earned intensity rather than ornament. Grammar, sequencing, and referents are clean, allowing the lyricism to carry momentum instead of bogging it down.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and almost every line does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). The metaphoric saturation occasionally skirts purple, but images are rarely mixed or contradictory, and clarity of action/causality is preserved throughout. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences, and the final third in particular is clean and propulsive. A touch more variation in figurative intensity—allowing a few plainer lines as contrast—would sharpen the peaks even further.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-by-line, the prose is lush, inventive, and information-dense; most sentences carry worldbuilding, emotion, and motion simultaneously. Extended metaphors (the ridge as dragon’s back, petals as layered memory) are coherent and sustained rather than stacked at random. There is some risk of purple prose and breathless length—nearly every sentence is highly figurative—which, in a longer piece, might begin to drag momentum, but here remains just within control. Minor trimming or occasional plainer lines would sharpen contrast and let the strongest images hit even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is high: sentences are generally precise, musical, and information-dense, with strong imagistic work and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (tides, breath, color, pruning) without collapsing into muddle. There is some stacking of metaphors and modifiers that edges toward purple in places, which mildly slows momentum in a few sentences. Nonetheless, clarity and closure are never obscured, and there are no obvious loops or technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong density ("fractals," "cobalt fire"). There are minor cliched phrases ("thunder rolled") and the "synchrotron no larger than a lunchbox" is a quick sci-fi hand-wave that stands out in an otherwise grounded texture, but the rhythm and flow support the pacing well.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from severe overwriting and metaphor density; nearly every sentence contains a simile ("like wolves," "like braille," "like glazing," "like a wing," "like moths," "like rays," "like enamel"), confusing the imagery. Additionally, the clumsy insertion of prompt phrases ("steady adaptive trail," "drifting resonance of their fear") creates repetitive artifacts that mar the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose has momentum, the density of figurative language (brass rivers, percussion constellations) sometimes clogs the reading flow. Crucially, the image of the child breathing a "cloud shaped like a treble clef" breaks the story’s physical reality and tone, reading as a cartoonish artifact in an otherwise grounded sci-fi setting.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is vivid and imaginative but suffers from high simile density ("like a skull," "like overdue fines," "like processional candles"), which occasionally creates a formulaic rhythm. While the imagery is striking ("books breathing underwater"), the reliance on "like" constructions slightly distances the reader from the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose flows well but suffers from melodramatic metaphors ("pebble smooth as a tear," "bruised the horizon") and a significant grammatical artifact in the insertion of the prompt phrase ("moved gently persistent," using an adjective as an adverb), which breaks the syntactic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is overwritten and heavy with metaphor stacking ("foggy lucidity made fruit flesh"), often prioritizing lyrical sound over clarity. Abstract phrasing ("every blossom a ghost") occasionally obscures the physical cause-and-effect of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in every sentence. Metaphors are original and coherent ("emulsions surrendering color like breath on glass," "time's texture... serrated"). The rhythm supports the pacing, accelerating during the bridge's disintegration and slowing for the contemplative resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the imagery is often striking, the prose suffers from significant repetition of prompt-based phrases ("patient strategic" appears four times; "staggering grace" three times). These lexical loops act as scaffolding artifacts that distract from an otherwise polished style.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the descriptive prose is vivid, the climax relies heavily on filter verbs and expository interiority ("She understood then," "She saw that," "She knew that") to deliver the epiphany. This distancing effect reduces immediacy at the most critical emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.0)
    Lexical repetition is a significant issue; the phrase "illuminated moment(s)" appears five times and "quietly savvy" twice in a very short text, creating a distracting echo. These artifacts suggest a lack of line-level editing and act as scaffolding rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong and evocative ("planks protesting like old bones"), but occasionally overwrought. Phrases like "emotional tectonic shift" and "harvesting mercury dreams" veer into purple territory, slightly diminishing the impact of the sharper imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking ("spilled through the holes like unpaid extras"), but suffers from high simile density that occasionally drifts into melodrama ("blurred the rust into galaxies"). The final paragraph’s didactic tone flattens the linguistic energy built up in the earlier scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level quality is marred by significant repetitive phrasing: "ambered hush" appears three times, "marbled hush" twice, and "mildly obsessed" twice in a short space. These artifacts create a stuttering effect and synonym churn that undermines the otherwise lush imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from telling over showing, particularly in lines like "mundane and mystical simultaneously." Some metaphors lean toward the abstract ("spaces between notes"), distancing the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft shows promise with strong imagery ("glowed... like a wound"), but slides into purple prose ("unbutton the sky") that calls attention to the writer rather than the scene. The phrase "ambiguously clear" feels shoehorned to meet a requirement rather than organically integrated into the description.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    Lexical repetition creates significant drag: "withered" appears four times, and "perfect" or "perfectly" appears six times in a short space. The verbatim repetition of the long phrase "commemorating small victories elaborately" in the final paragraph feels like a loop rather than a purposeful refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the prose is often beautiful, the rigid repetition of prompt phrases ("mechanically warm" x3, "obliging sky mechanic" x3) creates a noticeable template cadence that detracts from the flow. The hanging final sentence ("or") is a risky stylistic choice that may read as an error to some, though it fits the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is fluid but relies on filter verbs and abstract descriptors ("something raw and true") that dull immediacy. The imagery is often strong, but the reliance on "telling" internal states weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Imagery is vivid ("berries wept mercury," "boards flexing like lungs"), though a high density of "X like Y" similes occasionally drags on the rhythm. Some synesthetic phrasing borders on abstraction, but the specific physical details keep the narrative grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong rhythmic control. However, the repetition of the phrase "swallowed truth" (three times) and "beaded" (four times) creates a slight lexical drag that feels like prompt-stitching rather than organic recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the descriptive prose is often evocative, the final paragraph forces a dense cluster of verbatim prompt phrases into a single sentence; this "checklist" approach severely disrupts the rhythm and mars the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is significantly overwritten, relying on dense adjective strings ("mellow music therapist," "softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance") and strained metaphors ("question mark of newborn light") that slow momentum and distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, polished, and sensory-rich ("air tasted of cooled ember," "spine cracked open like a scream"). The imagery is evocative and drives the atmosphere effectively. A few metaphors border on the overwrought ("scream that had decided to stay"), but the overall control of rhythm and density is publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of prompt phrases ("open secret" appears five times; "transpose life" and "accidentally prophetic" twice each), creating a "Mad Libs" texture that breaks immersion. This repetitive labeling constitutes a major artifact loop that dulls the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from heavy adjectival density ("pulsed like bruises," "rosary of clicks") that occasionally slows momentum. A significant tense/grammar error occurs in the final paragraph ("exhaled, decorates with silence") due to awkward prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished and rich in imagery, but suffers from occasional metaphor collision that disrupts the aesthetic (e.g., "exhaustion crept like a tie-rod loosening"—a mechanical simile clashing with the organic/musical tone). Some descriptions, like "eyes ringed like tree stumps," feel slightly imprecise visually.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    While the prose is evocative, it suffers from metaphor density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "cathedral bones," "dying stars," "sucked light inward"), which occasionally slows momentum. The writing is polished, but a demanding editor would prune the figurative language to let the pivotal actions land with greater starkness.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished but marred by a diction error in the forced use of "enthrall" ("enthrall the numbness out"). Additionally, the word "hush" appears six times and the phrase "filament of hush" three times, creating a repetitive artifact that dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose rhythm is repeatedly stumbled by the clumsy integration of prompt phrases (e.g., "motivation to nurture integrity in solitude flared like a lantern"). These "text artifacts" create clunky, scaffold-like sentences that detract from the otherwise competent description.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally high-quality but suffers from the mechanical repetition of required phrases like "ultraviolet revealing" (5 times) and "aromatically cautious" (3 times). These repetitions create a template cadence that disrupts the otherwise polished flow.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high density. However, reliance on some familiar images ("liquid starlight," "heat above summer asphalt") and the slightly polysyndeton-heavy epiphany ("impossible and perfect and mine") deters a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lush and acoustically vivid ("minor seventh," "clinked underwater"), establishing a strong sensory reality. A few moments of "telling" ("Mara was acoustically perceptive," "intended to unbind") intrude on otherwise strong immersion, but the line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and imagery ("bloomed like a bruise"). Some figurative language borders on density ("honeyed regret, sharp with the citrus"), but it fits the subject matter of scent. No artifact loops or drag.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense, though it occasionally leans into slightly "twee" or purple imagery (e.g., "books were sleeping birds," "starlight into confetti") that risks over-sweetening the tone. However, the rhythm is strong, and the line-level execution is largely precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the imagery is strong, the verbatim repetition of four distinct multi-word phrases ("boldly sympathetic," "luminescent ache," "webs of kinship," "beyond the murmur...") within a short space creates a mechanical, looped feel. This pervasive echoing distracts from the otherwise polished prose.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("boats of digits"). There is a slight tendency toward purple phrasing ("womb of resonance," "liquid lace") that borders on decorative, but the overall line-level craft maintains momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    While mechanically clean, the prose suffers from mixed and overwrought metaphors, such as "tiles shifting like tectonic plates of turquoise memory." The density of figurative language occasionally obscures the physical action, prioritizing poetic sound over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.0)
    Heavy repetition of prompt phrases ("sapphire hush," "while the city’s lights flicker...") disrupts the prose rhythm and reads as unintegrated scaffold. These loops, combined with the physics errors, significantly degrade line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory anchoring. The phrase "circuitously sincere" is integrated well as a motif, though the final sentence leans into "telling" to summarize the thematic reconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts ("thresh meaning" appears three times; "wryly earnest" appears twice) create a distracting drumbeat that breaks immersion and signals prompt-forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, but distinct objective errors mar the polish required for top-tier publication. "Inhabitated" is a non-word/typo, and "shaped like an treble clef" contains a grammar error ("an" before a consonant sound). Additionally, the prompt phrase "steadily unpredictable" is repeated mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is overwritten with a suffocating density of metaphor; nearly every noun carries a simile (ink like blood, gutters singing, boots like apostrophes), halting momentum. The phrase "staggered intervals" is repeated four times in a short space, feeling like a forced constraint rather than an organic motif.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetitive phrasing artifacts severely hamper the prose quality. Complex phrases like "cracks in pavement forming arrows," "starlit vault in mist," "analytically artistic," and "trembling certainty" are repeated verbatim, creating a copy-paste effect that disrupts flow and feels like forced prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and dense with imagery, though occasionally overwrought ("tiny salt galaxies"). The verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("unheard symphony," "courageously kind") disrupts the otherwise smooth flow, creating small hiccups in the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes (using "like" roughly nine times in a short space), creating a repetitive cadence artifact. Metaphors are frequently mixed or purple ("eyes held auroras," "Möbius sigh"), which clutters the imagery and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is functional but relies on several stock similes ("brittle as old bone," "dawn was a bruise," "iron and thunder") which dilute the literary quality and distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally high-quality but suffers from the verbatim repetition of distinctive phrases ("earnestly studious" and "incandescent restraint" both appear twice). These repetitions feel like artificial prompt-checking rather than organic stylistic choices, breaking the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in lines like "sodium lamps became moons that bled yellow halos." While the metaphorical richness creates a strong texture, it occasionally borders on overwriting, though it remains controlled enough to support the story’s mythic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from a high density of similes ("like salt spray," "like a half-dug coffin," "like sunburned skin," "like fireflies," "like punctuation marks"). This metaphor stacking slows the momentum and feels decorative, distancing the reader from the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the prose is often evocative ("calliope music ricocheted... like gulls"), the text contains a severe artifact: a string of Chinese characters ("like投射的火花") in the climax that disrupts the narrative flow and destroys immersion. Additionally, the phrasing "walked orderly yet intuitive" is grammatically forced, likely to fit a prompt requirement. These errors disqualify the piece from publishability standards in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally high-quality and dense, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("bioluminescent regret") and the repetitive "template cadence" of the "Purposefully curious" sentence openings. The phrasing "feeling the tooth-marks of her grandmother’s gloves" is syntactically ambiguous and trips the reading eye.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong momentum and specific imagery ("lumen-veins," "singing spectra"). A few phrases in the climax ("kissed the water," "restless confetti") lean slightly towards the ornamental, but the overall control and rhythm are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery ("puppeteered by warm air"). However, a few metaphors lean toward the conventional ("shattered mirror"), and the phrase "breath-born droplets" borders on overwrought, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is overly reliant on simile scaffolds ("like smoke," "like a secret heartbeat," "like distant thunder," "like an old singer"), creating a repetitive texture that draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. The high density of figurative language ("moonlight tastes on the tongue") occasionally obscures clarity for the sake of poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong and evocative, but occasional images veer into sentimentality ("bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms" feels tonally jarring/twee). The line "sound thin as kelp" is a weak simile that distracts momentarily from the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the imagery is rich, the prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacting. Key phrases ("copperlight repose," "lattice from confessional," "the hush") are looped verbatim multiple times, creating a scaffold effect. Some metaphors are mixed and dense ("mouth still shaped around the final scream... slices the dark into slow-motion fins"), reducing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lyrical and dense with strong sensory details ("voice shaking like a leaf in furnace wind"). However, the final paragraph forces prompt phrases ("lovingly venomous, mournfully elated") into a clunky list that disrupts the rhythm and feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is rich and evocative, though it occasionally strains under adjective stacks (e.g., "bleeding hauntingly optimistic red"). This specific phrase feels like a forced insertion of the prompt attribute that disrupts the physical logic of the image. Otherwise, the line-level craft is high, with strong sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose leans toward purple description ("fossilized petals," "thick as honey") and suffers from awkward prompt integration ("Across excavating a tomb..." is grammatically jarring). The repetition of "warmly curious" (for roots and then a smile) indicates a lack of editorial polish.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by severe artifact looping: the five-word phrase "codes in children's sidewalk chalk" appears verbatim three times in a short text, as does "golden arcade at dawn." Additionally, "juxtapose" is used incorrectly as a noun ("formed by the juxtapose"), creating a jarring grammatical break.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant line-level artifacts mar the prose. The phrase "candle’s flame from eternal candle" is a redundant glitch, and "method of through adjacent possibilities" is ungrammatical. The relentless repetition of specific phrases (e.g., "echoed silence" four times) creates a stuttering rhythm that feels like prompt-checking rather than organic writing.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.5)
    A jarring tautology ("Words blossomed in the condensation: messages in condensation on windows") disrupts the flow, revealing a clumsy prompt insertion. Overwrought metaphors ("lungs collapsed around verbs") occasionally prioritize image over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the imagery is strong, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "graft new meaning onto old wounds" in the middle and end reads as a scaffold artifact. Additionally, "lotus-hearted" appears twice, contributing to a sense of unpolished redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with high image density and strong rhythm. A few images border on overwriting ("smelled faintly of fermented stars" pushes the limits of synesthesia), but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric intent well.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative phrasing like "verbs without endings." It occasionally drifts into dense abstraction ("paint flake of pure inquiry") that privileges sound over sense, but the technical craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetition of fixed epithets (the full phrase "charming rogue scholar" appears three times; "candidly cryptic" three times) creates a template-like rhythm that stalls momentum. These artifacts serve as scaffolding rather than organic description, reducing line-level density and sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from the forced repetition of complex phrases ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy," "off-key wind") multiple times, creating visible text artifacts. "Shellgram" creates a jarring register clash against the established elevated tone.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from a pervasive "Noun of Noun" artifact (storm of voices, museum of extinct feelings, laugh of creation, shout of extinction), which creates a monotonous, formulaic rhythm. This stylistic tic draws attention to the writing rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant repetitive phrasing ("glass ink well" x5, "symphonies of truth" x6). This creates a loop artifact that disrupts the rhythm and makes the integration of prompt elements feel forced.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from "adjectivitis" and clunky modifier clusters like "slyly heartfelt reverence" which slow the momentum. While mechanically sound, the line-level craft relies on telling (summarizing the song's effect) rather than showing the sensory shift in the acoustics.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is overwritten with dense, stacked metaphors ("feathery envelopes," "hope on a timer") that obscure clarity. A significant text-generation glitch occurs in the tenth paragraph ("learning to trust again across learning to trust again"), breaking syntactic logic and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from repetitive phrasing (e.g., "fractured hush" appears twice as a set phrase; "necessary distances" is repeated four times). The phrase "featherly determined" reads as a slightly awkward construction, likely forced by the prompt, which disrupts the rhythm of an otherwise smooth sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and dense, though it leans heavily on similes ("like inverted rainfall," "like luminous respite," "like slow-motion arrows") which can feel slightly ornamental. Rhythm and flow are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from "figurative muddle" and high density; nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor ("pulsed like a heart," "snail's horn," "dawn smiles," "clattered like bells"), creating a barrier to clarity. The phrase "gloom felt cheerful" borders on oxymoronic confusion without sufficient grounding. The reliance on "transliterated" and other prompt words feels repetitive rather than integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose has strong rhythmic moments, but "By happen the beam..." is a jarring syntactical awkwardness (likely a forced prompt inclusion) that disrupts flow. Occasional phrasing veers into the overwrought ("tattooed in invisible ink").

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    While polished, the prose suffers from significant metaphor density and occasional incoherence (e.g., "obsidian grace cutting her face into a crescent moon"). Mandatory phrases are sometimes shoehorned, disrupting syntax ("moment she first fledged—spontaneously anchored—at age seven"), and the reliance on abstract genitive constructions ("language of undertow") reduces clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is dense and often vivid ("storms slid off them like apologies"), but marred by heavy adjective-noun pairings ("noctilucent reckonings," "brutal clarity"). The forced insertion of the prompt phrase "prism atrium in mist" as a compound noun creates a syntactic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Technical control is present, but the prose suffers from significant metaphor density ("fragile as testimony," "blade of mercy," "dictionary entry for pain"). This figurative congestion obscures clarity and aestheticizes the suffering to the point of distraction, triggering overwriting penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from a density of "purple" abstractions ("scent of unopened mornings," "dawn before language") that prioritize sound over sense. While the imagery is often beautiful, the heavy reliance on metaphorical phrasing in every beat slows momentum and occasionally obscures the concrete action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and sensory-rich, effectively supporting the surreal tone. A few metaphor clusters are slightly dense (e.g., "laughter a hollow skull"), but the style largely succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally high-density and evocative, but suffers from significant repetition artifacts. The phrase "perceptively calm" appears twice in identical fashion, and "grace" and "dusky harmony" are also looped. These repetitions feel like inserted prompt-checks rather than organic rhythmic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("hues of violet and gold," "shattered into a thousand pieces," "clutched... like a shield") and abstract phrasing. The reliance on familiar descriptors and melodramatic adjectives obscures the specific reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-rich ("calcified inside him like secret sentimental plaque"). A few functional filter verbs in key moments ("He understood," "he could see") slightly distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.6)
    Heavy usage of repetitive artifacts harms the prose; "Between sigh and smile" and "bodily poetic" each appear three times in fixed positions, creating a visible scaffold. The density of adjective-noun pairings ("bruised violet," "arterial red") occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.3)
    Significant deduction for artifacting and repetition. Full phrases ("subversive puppet shows in seedy bars," "uncommonly serene," "meteor hush") are repeated verbatim multiple times, creating a copy-paste cadence. This mechanical insertion of prompt elements obstructs the flow and draws attention to the scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric but suffers from noticeable repetition of prompt keywords (e.g., "blushing stillness" appears three times; "transient" forms repeated close together). These artifacts give the text a manufactured feel that detracts from the otherwise high-quality density.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in every line. There is a slight tendency toward adjective-heavy constructions ("emerald hush," "razored clarity"), and the second insertion of the required phrase "technically gentle" in the final paragraph creates a minor rhythmic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and image-rich ("melody that keeps the dark amused"), establishing a strong rhythm. However, the density of metaphor occasionally obscures physical mechanics, and the prompt phrase "precisely playful" feels awkwardly inserted into the sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose is generally rich and descriptive, the mandatory phrases ("empirical irony," "dusky harmony," "encrypted devotion") are repeated to the point of becoming distractingly artificial artifacts. "Empirical irony" appears three times in clumsy constructions, and the final sentence stacks these terms into a dense "word salad" that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is dense and polished ("clicked like a dying heartbeat"), but occasionally suffers from mixed metaphors ("calculus of vengeance" vs. "flood biology") and abstract phrasing ("spirit skin," "strings of mercy") that slightly distances the reader from the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, mirroring the breath-work central to the plot. However, a reliance on standard adjective-noun pairings ("reckless attempt," "decisive motion," "soft starlight") occasionally reduces the muscularity of the verbs and density of the lines.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally evocative ("metal bite bark like confession"), but marred by the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("muttered endearingly feisty curses") and occasional overwriting ("green applause").

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is high-density and imaginative, with metaphors that generally land well ("time folded like origami," "books demanding their stories returned"). While the figurative language is heavy in the climax, it fits the genre and doesn't obscure the physical action of the resolution. The rhythm effectively accelerates during the memory-loss sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from repetitive tagging ("carefully resourceful" is inserted awkwardly twice) and full noun-phrase echoes ("unheard symphony," "botanical diary") that stall momentum. While the imagery is often beautiful, the density of "X like Y" similes and metaphorical actions (seeds falling through commas) occasionally clutters the causality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose suffers from high-density metaphor stacking that obscures clarity (e.g., "lions of light pacing behind bars of forgotten laughter"). The shift to meta-fictional metaphors ("fog... into pages," "ship became a mere comma") clashes with the established physical reality of the carnival, and the prompt phrase "unkindled solace" is repeated, making the artifice visible.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery, though the metaphor density sometimes draws attention to itself over the action. The prompt phrase "warmly methodical" is repeated as a tag in a way that feels slightly mechanical, but overall sentence rhythm and clarity are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.5)
    The text suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing and element stuffing. "Gently luminous" appears three times, "hammered repose" twice (once in an awkward simile), and "examining crack patterns" three times, creating a distinct artifact effect that disrupts the prose flow.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft is marred by "corroged" (a likely typo or non-word), heavy reliance on filter verbs ("She understood then"), and sentimental abstractions ("hope in the shape of ribs"). The prose frequently tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    Imagery is often striking ("thunder rolled like archival carts"), but syntactic monotony hinders the rhythm; too many sentences rely on a repetitive "She [verb]" structure (She knelt, She drew, She noted, She walked). Additionally, the realization is filtered through "She understood then..." rather than being shown purely through the action, slightly distancing the reader at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically strong, maintaining a high density of imagery suitable for the genre. Minor friction arises from the insertion of required prompt phrases, and some similes ("clinking like distant thunder") slightly strain scale.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but marred by occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") and the scaffolded insertion of the trait ("warmly observant by trade"). These artifacts distance the reader slightly during key internal pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and imaginative but suffers from metaphor crowding; "audible colors" and "intangibly tangible" border on synesthetic muddle that obscures clarity. While the rhythm is good, the reliance on adjectival stacking ("iron-sweet, lullaby, bolt-sigh") sometimes slows momentum at critical junctures.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished but occasionally drifts into overwrought metaphor (e.g., the wind as a "hushed seamstress" slipping needles). Some phrases like "shoes kissing stone" lean toward cliché, slightly reducing the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing ("fractured into impossible colors," "beautiful absurdity") and a significant diction error with the word "sallying" (used incorrectly as a verb for removing paint). This misuse, along with "tell-heavy" phrasings, disrupts the line-level authority required for a high literary score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose suffers from reliance on cliché ("burned like embers," "frozen tears") and repetitive phrasing ("loaded emptiness" appears twice). The density of "breath/suffocate" references feels repetitive rather than rhythmic. The writing tells more than it shows, using abstract labels ("heaviness of his father's disappointment") where concrete details were needed.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and imaginative ("barometric scars," "photosynthesize into debt") with strong rhythmic control. The figurative density is very high, bordering on overwrought in places ("jagged like broken code"), but the imagery consistently serves the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from overwriting, with dense figurative language clogging nearly every sentence ("first yawn," "wound in the machine," "powdered light"). Specific phrases are repeated carelessly ("eloquently silent" appears twice; "golden shadows" appears three times), indicating a lack of polish. These artifacts draw attention to the writing rather than the story, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is generally evocative, the required phrase "factually mystical" is inserted clumsily twice ("factual mystical patience," "factually mystical artifact"), jarring the high-fantasy tone with technical-sounding diction. Additionally, some descriptions tilt toward purple prose ("tasted of regret and cinnamon"), slightly diluting the otherwise sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally overwrought ("paper yield like old scab," "unfurl... like sunrise over a battlefield"). The high metaphor count slows momentum slightly in the middle section. However, the rhythm is generally strong, and the sentence-level craft supports the story's melancholic tone without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense but suffers from mixed metaphors ("starlight braided into copper") and abstract phrasing that obscures physical action. Technical descriptions ("broadcast backward through the lines") trade logic for poetic sound, creating confusion about what is actually happening in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the line-level imagery is often striking ("snake devouring its own tail made of breath and brass"), the prose suffers from a "scaffold" effect due to the repetitive insertion of mandatory phrases. Full strings like "prism atrium in mist" (4x) and "radiant grotto in mist" (3x) create a stuttering, template-cadence loop that breaks the immersive spell and drags the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    Required phrases are inserted with syntax errors ("her heart mossy delight unfurling" misses a verb/preposition; "emerge transformed always after" is clumsy). The four-word object name creates a repetitive artifact that drags on the prose. These mechanical flaws significantly hinder readability.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery. However, the integration of required phrases creates rhythmic stumbles (e.g., "He was uncertainly certain"), and the explicit thematic statement in the middle disrupts the otherwise immersive flow.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rich with imagery ("syllables pool like mercury," "calcined into something ductile"). At times, the density of abstract metaphors ("luminous regret," "silent syllabus") borders on purple, but the line-level rhythm generally sustains the story’s momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.7)
    While the rhythm is generally strong, the prose suffers from mixed or obscure metaphors ("liquid apology," "ribs of dawn") and the awkward, verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache"). These artifacts disrupt the otherwise lush texture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in lines like “second skeleton announcing my crimes.” A few metaphors strain slightly (“hiccup of light,” “wedding ring made of scars”), pushing the density toward purple, but the overall craft is polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and dense, but marred by repetitive phrasing (the required attribute appears three times; "copper and salt" appears twice) and some cliché "magic shop" lists. The high density of adjectives occasionally slows momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the imagery is inventive, the prose suffers from simile density (e.g., "like a lung," "like blown fuses," "like a blade"), creating a repetitive syntactic pattern that slows momentum in peak beats. This triggers the density deduction for overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-density and propulsive, with metaphors organically derived from the protagonist's trade ("time folded like a signature"). The repetition of the "negotiable" motif is purposeful and teaches the reader the rules of this shifting reality.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("glassy throat," "dagger of light"), supporting the "baroque" setting. However, the repetition of the distinct word "burnished" (voice, sorrow, sorrow) three times draws attention to itself as an artifact. Occasionally, the figurative language stacks heavily (e.g., "ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood"), threatening to obscure the image with density.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from density issues, with a relentless barrage of similes ("like bronze snow," "like balloons," "loud as trumpets") that draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. The "purple" texture obscures the causal mechanics of the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high-impact imagery like "cracked like a wink" and "silence thick as felt." There is a slight tendency toward metaphorical density that threatens to slow propulsion (e.g., "quilt of petrichor"), but the precision of the verbs keeps the narrative moving. The line-level craft successfully supports the magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density is generally high, but the verbatim repetition of "perpetually learning" (three times) and "turbine-hum" acts as a noticeable drag on momentum. These loops feel like prompt-adherence artifacts rather than stylistic refrains.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the rhythmic flow is generally good, the prose suffers from "purple" phrasing and label-speak. Crucially, the text ends abruptly mid-sentence ("reminding the world that the dawning hush is"), a mechanical failure that instantly disqualifies it from "immediate publishability."

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose density is high with strong, original imagery ("missing teeth want their tongue," "scallop edges for vowels"). A few phrases lean slightly purple ("parted like a sigh," "dark petals"), but the line-level propulsion is excellent, and the integration of required terms is mostly seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sensory density is exceptional ("sulfur smell mixed with brine," "orange petals"); the prose rhythm supports the ritualistic pacing without stalling momentum, and imagery is consistently specific.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly polished, with strong sensory imagery ("caramel curl of wax," "greasy rainbow"). However, the density of adjectival phrasing and metaphor ("quiver like a tuning fork," "leaves holding breath") occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly slowing the narrative momentum. The "velvet disquiet" sentence at the end is evocative but syntactically heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose density is high and evocative, with standout lines like "glaciers grinding cities into glitter." While the imagery is lush, it occasionally borders on overwrought ("lullaby shouted across a storm," "silk soaked in dawn"), but the technical precision remains strong. The integration of required phrases is seamless, avoiding the "stitched" feel common in prompt-driven flash fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "clouds surged like slow whales" and "warm stones dropped into cold milk." There is a slight over-reliance on similes in high-density clusters. The required phrase "credibly curious" creates a minor rhythmic stumble, but line-level craft is otherwise polished.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    Immediate publishability is blocked by objective errors ("practiced empathize," "a obsolete") and word echoes ("dawn" used twice in one sentence). These flaws are fatal for a "flawless" standard.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    The phrase "tranquilly perceptive" appears three times and "contextual clues" twice, creating a repetitive, templated cadence that signals a lack of line-level control. Overwritten phrases ("hush heavier than honey") occasionally reduce clarity in favor of ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally strains clarity ("green wheat like an unabridged novel," "blood from a bitten minute"). While the rhythm is smooth, these strained similes distract from the sensory immediacy the story aims to convey. The writing is technically competent but draws too much attention to its own construction.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but dense with "scaffold" metaphors and abstract phrasings ("warmed his hands over the burnished hush") that blur physical logic. The integration of required phrases feels forced, creating minor rhythm bumps, though the general cadence is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful, with high information density in almost every line. A few metaphors feel slightly strained ("corridors bent like intestines," "teeth like yellowed parchment"), but the overall control of imagery and the absence of filler scaffold sentences support the high score.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffold; the anaphoric sequence ("She saw...") effectively heightens the climax. Imagery like "cello made of bone" is striking and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lush, high-density prose with strong rhythm, though occasionally redundant ("coral... once been alive," "swayed like underwater kelp"). Imagery is inventive ("tiny coffins," "prisoners pardoned"), maintaining momentum through the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from the forced, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("wild hush," "tinted revelations," "intuitive descriptive") which creates a looping cadence. Some metaphors strain regarding clarity ("blood that had decided to become a sunrise").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is high, with evocative imagery like "hatch sighed open" and "sconces like a dare." There is a tendency toward overwriting ("echo of its silence in his bones," "hollowed heart"), where slightly fresher phrasing would sharpen the impact. The density of metaphor is ambitious but occasionally muddies the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and rich, with high information density and strong rhythm. While some metaphors border on the precious ("tasting the colors," "sliding on a mirror of her own frozen song"), they largely serve the magical realism. The line-level craft is polished, with no significant artifacts or drag, though the figurative density is very high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density in lines like "stone mouths shaping vowels of air." While the sensory pairing of "iron and lilac" hovers on the edge of overwriting, the overall control of imagery and rhythm remains exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and rich with imagery, though occasionally the metaphor stacking ("storm-cloud suede," "cataract of burning alphabets") slows the momentum slightly. A few filter verbs ("She recalled," "She understood") distance the reader in moments that could be more immediate. Overall, the craft is high, with strong rhythm and sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("knuckles blanched," "suspended mid-tag"). There is a slight over-reliance on simile chains ("like prayer, like promise, like the beginning") that clutters the final emotional beat, but the density and flow are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("needle stitching sky to stone," "ghost sentences"). The imagery is consistent with the tone. A few metaphors border on the ornate ("sound of a story learning to breathe"), but the line-level craft remains disciplined and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory anchoring ("tectonic teeth grinding," "swirls of mercury") that propels the action. However, the density of figurative language occasionally verges on ornamental ("glinting like desperate sunrise," "acid recoiled... as if ashamed"), which slightly distracts from the stark reality of the situation. A few images feel slightly overwritten, but the overall momentum is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-impact imagery like "gulls screamed like circular saws eating the sky" that immediately sets the tone. The writing avoids scaffold and loops, maintaining propulsion even during the reflective moments of painting.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from high-density overwriting and repetitive phrasing, specifically four variations of "scream/screaming" in a short space. Mixed or overwrought metaphors ("bleeding... like a wound," "air stop screaming") create a melodramatic texture that obscures the genuine emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, there is a marked overuse of similes ("thigh like a bruise," "heavy as a coffin," "light as a letter," "veins like," "voice like"), often appearing in clusters. This syntactic repetition creates a template cadence that detracts slightly from the otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is evocative but suffers from metaphor density ("teeth confessing," "fine as frost," "roots like nooses") that occasionally slows momentum. The relentless figurative language risks becoming textural noise, though it remains grammatically clean.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly dense ("milk stirred with silver"), sustaining a strong mood throughout. A few metaphors strain slightly for effect (e.g., "fog hums in a bell"—fog typically dampens sound), but the rhythmic propulsion and sensory precision generally support the literary tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("took Elias's breath away," "strange warmth," "wet darkness") and abstract descriptors ("impossible colors") that obscure imagery. There is a lack of density and freshness at the line level, resulting in a readable but textureless experience.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Repetitive phrasing of key elements ("bleeding starlight" appears five times; "ember grotto on the ridge" three times) creates a noticeable scaffold effect that hampers prose flow. The tautology "thinned into lace, a lacy menace" is a line-level weakness that disrupts the otherwise polished imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft struggles with mixed or strained metaphors ("voice cracking like cooling magma," "palette of resolve shifted"). These poetic reaches often obscure physical reality or logic, creating friction that drags on the reading experience despite the otherwise clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The writing is dense with high-quality imagery, and lines like "mouth open like a broken shutter" and "autumn tongues" are striking. However, the density of figurative language is nearly saturated; almost every sentence bears a metaphor or simile, which risks exhausting the reader and dulling the impact of the strongest images. Despite this slight overwriting, the technical control is high, and the "white ink" closure image is executed flawlessly. A slightly leaner approach in the mid-section would elevate this to the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the sensory density is high, the prose suffers significantly from loop artifacts. The exact repetition of "trembling calm" (three times), "ordinary miracles" (twice), and "reading between lines" (twice) violates the loop/scaffold screen, making the craft feel repetitive and constrained by the prompt list.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose density is high and evocative, with strong imagery like the "falling moon frozen mid-plunge." A few phrases lean toward the conventional ("lightning spidered") or slightly heavy poetic abstraction ("glassy shards that would slice the silence"), but the overall line-level craft is polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures (Subject-Verb starts: "She set," "She touched," "She uncorked"), creating a template cadence that drags the rhythm. While the imagery is imaginative, the density of similes ("like a shroud," "like slow arpeggios," "like rosin," "like predators") clutters the text and reduces immediacy. Cleaning up these artifacts would significantly sharpen the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.6)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose relies on dense, abstract noun phrasing ("centrifugal yearning equals centripetal truth") and some stock poetic imagery ("tasted of starlight," "cool detachment of a mortician"). Repetition of required phrases ("resounding hush") becomes noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive scaffolding. The phrase "Through counting backwards..." is used three times as a sentence opener to bridge paragraphs, creating a jarring template cadence. Additionally, specific descriptors like "razor edges" and "eminently peculiar" are repeated verbatim to the point of distraction, feeling like forced insertions rather than organic motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and propelled by strong verbs ("spores swarmed," "breach had stepped through itself"). The imagery is consistently fresh. A minor deduction for the repetition of the distinct metaphor "quiet wildfire" (once in narration, once in a dialogue tag), which echoes slightly in a short space, but the line-level craft is otherwise publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythms ("mutter equations like prayers"), but relies too heavily on balanced abstractions ("hold and release, to mourn and move") that read like rhetorical devices rather than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, but occasional overwriting distracts ("tasted like rusted rain," "climbed the tunnel walls like damp ivy"). These synesthetic metaphors clutter the imagery in places where starker description might have landed with more force. Rhythm and sentence variety are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.5)
    A fatal grammatical error in the climax ("she steep the locket itself into the tube") breaks the narrative spell and signals a lack of polish. Additionally, prompt phrases like "proximate causes" are inserted awkwardly, creating syntactic stumbles that disrupt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("voice cracking like old paint"), with strong rhythm and density. Imagery is specific and purposeful, avoiding standard artifacts, though the density of metaphor is high.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense and polished, but the reliance on template sentence structures ("He rose," "He knelt," "He traced") creates a noticeable artifact. Some metaphors are slightly mixed ("bloated with consonants"), though the imagery is generally vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    Imagery is dense and evocative ("sprouted into static"), but occasionally lapses into "workshop" clichés ("tasted of recycled air and regret") or overwriting ("husk of error"). The meta-commentary on the nature of ink disrupts the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, relying on dense, stacked metaphors ("ladders," "lantern," "turbines powered by evaporated grief") and abstract summary that occasionally obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=2.5)
    The text suffers severely from repetitive artifacts; the phrase "volcanic tenderness" appears five times, often in nonsensical contexts ("tracing walls with volcanic tenderness," "voice echoing... with volcanic tenderness"). "Analytically intuitive" and "portray" are also repeated mechanically. These insertions break the prose rhythm and obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and dense with imagery, but relies occasionally on explanatory scaffolding and filter verbs ("trying to externalize," "proving that entanglement," "testing whether") to convey intent, which distances the reader during key actions.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("violet ribbons," "topography of dead ends"). However, occasional reliance on stock phrasing ("impossible clarity," "understanding flooding her features") and slightly filter-heavy descriptions dampens the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("reflections nested like minnows"), though some required phrases ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension") feel inserted rather than organic. There is a slight over-reliance on abstract nouns ("longing," "possibility") to carry emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is technically polished but suffers from high metaphor density ("roots dripped night," "reference cards stirred like roosting birds") that occasionally obscures clarity. The reliance on abstract imagery in nearly every sentence creates a "purple" texture that slows momentum. A tighter edit would privilege concrete action over constant figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is rhythmically strong but suffers from metaphor stacking and slight logical slips (e.g., "coiling hawsers instead of fists"—one does not coil fists; "swans bred from violence now impotent"). The ending contains a specific cliché artifact ("breathed once, twice") that detracts from the otherwise fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in almost every line. There are moments of slight overwriting ("infant made of endings," "color of apologies no one had accepted") where the metaphor draws attention to itself rather than the image, but the overall rhythm and propulsion are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and rich with imagery ("skipped stone of sound"), creating a strong aesthetic texture. However, the repetitive use of prompt phrases like "tremor of certainty" and "aesthetically driven" (three times each) feels mechanical and slightly disrupts the otherwise polished flow.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("impossible magentas," "screaming against the next"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("Milo understood," "realized") that distances the reader from the immediate experience of the epiphany. The "innocently cunning smile" phrase is an oxymoron that feels forced, likely due to prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.8)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacting of required phrases; "powerfully gentle," "golden shadows," and "propel" are each repeated 3–5 times, creating a mechanical, "mad-libs" texture. This lexical looping disrupts the prose rhythm and highlights the artificiality of the insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good control of sentence variety. A few mixed metaphors (fabric woven of dreams yielding water) and the reliance on abstract labels ("fragments of the lesson") slightly obscure the line-level logic and reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and rich with imagery, but relies too heavily on "noun-is-like-noun" similes (coin, relic, circuit diagram, monitor, vault) which creates a repetitive syntactic cadence. The cliché "vanished like smoke" is a noticeable dip in an otherwise inventive lexical field.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetitive strain from verbatim phrase cycling; "bronze prism pagoda" appears five times and "atoms of nostalgia" five times in a short text, creating a droning, unnatural cadence. The prose is dense with similes ("like a dying heart," "like luminous dust," "like guilt") that clutter the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally evocative, but the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("softly, deliberately" twice; "luminous regret" twice; "metamorphose" forms three times) creates visible scaffolding that disrupts the rhythm. These echoes feel like checklist completions rather than organic stylistic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally evocative but suffers from the verbatim repetition of distinctive phrases ("quietly vivid" and "shimmering stillness" both appear twice). These echoes clutter the short word count and feel like forced insertions rather than organic motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high with excellent imagery ("last grain snagged... like a lodged bone"). Word choices like "widdershins" and "radicles" add texture without disrupting flow. The phrase "chlorophyll code" is a minor tonal slip—slightly too sci-fi for the mythic moment—but does not significantly mar the overall polish.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and a high density of straining metaphors (e.g., pigeons as "white sprocket holes," which confuses voids with solid objects). This figurative density slows narrative momentum and draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is atmospheric but marred by a glaring tense error ("She tilt the tube") that disrupts the polished surface. Additionally, some metaphorical density ("migraine of unborn constellations") feels overwrought, crowding the action rather than illuminating it.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and dense, though occasionally overwrought with metaphor (&quot;gears kissing the sand,&quot; &quot;screaming mouth&quot;). The density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum, but the imagery remains striking and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery that propels the story forward. However, some metaphors strain coherence ("tuning fork struck by moonlight," "steam that spelled probable miracles"), creating moments of abstraction that blur the visual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant repetition of key phrases ("shoreline lullaby" x3, "gently persistent" x3, "indirect routes" x2) reveals a struggle to integrate prompts organically. The prose relies on telling over showing ("served them well," "understanding that"), creating a flat, summary-like texture.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    A significant grammatical error ("he remain, motionless") disrupts the climax, which is disqualifying for a flawless standard. Additionally, the simile "knuckles whitening like sunrise through ice" lacks physical coherence, as sunrise typically adds color rather than removing it.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose leans into "purple" territory with mixed metaphors ("voice calm as closed winter") and clichés ("roared in silent approval"). Adjective-heavy descriptions ("borrowed gravitas," "borrowed starlight") slow the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, though metaphor density is high and sometimes clichéd ("flapping like a gull with a broken wing"). The required phrase "periodically eternal" is integrated grammatically but remains semantically awkward, creating a slight stumble in the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.0)
    While some imagery lands, the prose suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally clashes (e.g., "peppercorns flung into blue soup"), and the mechanical failure of the cutoff ending significantly impacts quality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("mineral clouds swirled like galaxies"), maintaining good rhythm. Minor slips into cliché ("knees screaming") and slightly heavy adjectival stacking prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("roots grip stone like desperate fingers"). Minor slips into preciousness ("pain pauses, confused") or scientific oddities ("green oxygen") prevent a higher score, but the line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the imagery is lush and dense ("margins bled contradictory coastlines"), the text suffers from severe artifacts. The phrase "questions rhetorical questions" appears twice as a grammatical error, and "luminescent ache" is repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.0)
    The phrase "serene anger" appears four times, creating a repetitive artifact that dulls the prose. Clichés like "stretched like taffy" and "fish through water," along with the forced insertion of prompt phrases, significantly hamper line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is marred by the repetition of "dizzying quiet" (three times) and the "blink" phrase (twice), creating a loop artifact. "Bravely conflicted" is a weak tell that flattens the emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but leans toward adjectival density and abstract nouns ("madness," "harmony," "vengeance"). While the grafting descriptions are tactile and precise, the reliance on "telling" regarding emotions flattens the immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    Propulsion and density are generally strong, but the text suffers from noticeable lexical repetition artifacts ("lullabies" x4, "sleepwalkers/ing" x3) in a short space. While the imagery is vivid, phrases like "watercolor repentance" and "net sewn of lullabies and teeth" verge on purple overwriting that risks obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Imagery is often striking ("gears groaned like old editors"), but the opening sentence contains a jarring tense clash ("arrived after the journalist calls") due to awkward prompt integration. Occasional overwrought metaphors ("smelled of ink and thunder," "forgiving hearts") slightly mar the otherwise high-quality prose.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Imagery is vivid and dense ("sawdust that smelled of nursery pine"), though occasional phrasing leans slightly melodramatic ("dissonance... crackled... like static"). The integration of UI elements ("UPGRADE FIRMWARE") into the lyrical prose is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers significantly from the repetitive use of multi-word phrases ("lilac unease" x4, "emergent hush" x4, "whispering gallery tile flake" x3). These act as text artifacts that create a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm, detracting from the otherwise polished line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric but relies occasionally on abstract phrasing ("efficiency of a blade," "guilty relief") or clunky modification. The rhythm supports the contemplative mood, though the density of adjectives sometimes slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is high-density and evocative without collapsing into purple abstraction; the figurative language is functional, teaching the reader the rules of the magic system. Rhythm and syntax modulate effectively to match the rising intensity of the performance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.0)
    A severe repetitive artifact drags this score down: the phrase "fractally precise" appears five times in a short text, becoming a distracting tic. The prose relies on telling over showing ("The recall had been catastrophic," "Her breakthrough came"), flattening the momentum into a report.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("walls went blind," "seed of pure resonance"). There is a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing ("ache older than grammar") that borders on purple, but the line-level craft generally supports the story's gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rich, with high information density and strong rhythm. There are moments of overwriting where the metaphor becomes decorative rather than functional ("hiccupped sobs," "dawn’s first blade"). However, the line-level craft generally supports the magical realist tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    Significant repetitive artifacting mars the prose, with "silver hush" appearing three times and "vouchsafe" twice in awkward constructions. Additionally, the physical confusion of reading a code in snow while brushing it away indicates a lack of line-level logic control.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is marred by noticeable repetition and tautology (e.g., "a promise scratched like a palimpsest promise"). Specific unique phrases like "ambient awareness" and "distill complexity into essence" are repeated verbatim in close proximity (loops), which breaks the immersive spell and suggests a lack of final polish.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and polished, though occasionally overwritten with mixed metaphors ("sun printed kindness"). Prompt phrases are repeated verbatim ("chimney smoke flattened"), which creates a slight mechanical rhythm distinct from the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from "simile fatigue," with nearly every noun paired with a metaphorical modifier ("sloshed like a heartbeat," "like a tiny eviction notice," "cracking like winter seed"). This density of figurative language clogs the momentum and draws attention to the writer's hand, obscuring the scene's immediacy. The writing needs pruning to allow the strong underlying images to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the prose contains beautiful imagery ("wings folded like a scholar closing a book"), the repetitive insertion of clunky, multi-syllabic required phrases ("atomically reflective" appears three times) disrupts the rhythm and creates visible text artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery throughout. However, the integration of required phrases ("inevitably whimsical sound") creates clunky, adjective-heavy artifacts, and the metaphor density sometimes obscures rather than clarifies the emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically strong, with high information density ("velvet migraine," "chipped silver coin"). A minor slip is the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("ethereal grit") which feels slightly less organic than the surrounding text.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and evocative, with metaphors that reinforce the industrial/cartographic aesthetic ("pulse rattling like loose rolling stock"). Rhythmic control is strong, propelling the reader through the distortion sequence without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is competent but suffers from high simile density ("like guilt," "like a warning flag," "like a heart shocked"). While evocative, the heavy metaphorical scaffolding in peak beats distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is competent but frequently overwritten with abstract metaphors (“perfume of denial,” “bravery and burial are separated by one thin board”). The mandatory phrase “nervously confident” is inserted clumsily as an adjective modifying "hands," resulting in a tell that clashes with the visual of trembling.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from significant metaphor congestion ("ashes of never," "potter kneads," "frozen pixels," "scaffold wrap"). The density of competing imagery—digital, analog, construction, ceramic—often obscures the action rather than illuminating it. Peak beats become muddled by this figurative layering, reducing clarity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers significantly from the forced repetition of keyword phrases ("polished calm," "dusky harmony," "territorial markers") which appear multiple times, creating a scaffold/loop artifact that breaks immersion. Phrases like "silence felt perceptively calm" are awkward and redundant. While the density is good, these specific repetitive tics lower the line-level quality substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is suffocated by strained metaphors ("bruise-shaped syllable," "tongue of midnight solace") and decorative adjectives that obscure clarity. A typo in the final sentence ("daylies" instead of "daylilies") and the reliance on purple phrasing indicate a lack of rigorous editing.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    High-level imagery is marred by simile crowding (10+ uses of "like/as") and a confusing physical action in the climax ("unbent her knees... until she knelt") that momentarily obscures the image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, largely successful, though occasionally congested. Phrasing like "lungs fizzing" clashes slightly in register with the otherwise elevated, mythic tone of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("lighter than an empty coat"). There is some adjective stacking and abstract phrasing ("fiercely gentle urgency") that drags on momentum. The line-level craft is strong enough to support the surreal premise, but the prompt insertions are visible as seams.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by filter verbs ("He realized," "He noticed") and awkward phrasing required to fit prompt elements ("confidently uncertain," "wrest it into place"). The final paragraph is overwrought and tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery (“filings that stuck like frost”). There is a slight tendency toward “writer math” metaphors (love/time=velocity), but they fit the character’s specific worldview. Rhythm and flow are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose contains vivid imagery ("call-numbers... attach themselves to gulls"), but is marred by the repetitive use of the phrase "wintersun serenity" (three times) and the word "contradiction" (four forms). These repetitions stall the lexical momentum and feel like unpolished artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, effectively establishing the dreamlike atmosphere. However, the high density of figurative language (e.g., "rainbows trapped in mid-sob," "rusted longing") occasionally borders on overwriting and threatens to stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with motifs like &quot;daringly methodical&quot; used purposefully to mark the shift in the protagonist's state. The line-level craft supports the magical realism tone without slipping into purple prose, maintaining momentum through the descent and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from extreme artifacting: "Through propagation delays" appears four times as a transition crutch, and "cyclically reversed cycle" is a logical tautology that degrades clarity. The density of repeated 4-5 word strings violates the loop/scaffold rule and creates a mechanical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and lyrical, with high information density. While occasional phrases lean toward the abstract ("colder than regret"), the imagery is largely fresh and evocative ("pupils were inkblots"), driving the narrative forward with strong rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and evocative but suffers from high metaphor density ("like constellations," "like a held note," "like honey") that risks stalling momentum. The rhythm is strong, though the reliance on simile draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose leans heavily into purple overwriting ("smelled of fermented forgiveness," "grief-shaped mouth"), mixing abstract concepts with sensory details in confusing ways. The repeated forced verbing of "scallop" draws attention to the writing rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("cracked lighthouse window," "pale thread"), but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally slows momentum. The simile "particles of doubt... like dust motes" explains an image that was already working. Some abstract phrasing ("nuance couldn't be welcomed... through logic alone") drifts into essayistic territory.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    High points of imagery ("silvering toward childhood") are balanced by some generic phrasing ("quantum foam," "ancient song"). The prose has good rhythm and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is overwritten with a high density of abstract metaphors ("ancient prayers," "throat of endless echoes") that obscure clarity. Significant artifacts appear, including the tautological "weathered resolve of his weathered face" and a reliance on filter verbs ("he knew," "he noticed," "he understood").

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose density is high and functional, with strong imagery like "barcoded snowflakes" doing heavy lifting for world-building without stalling momentum. The sentence-level rhythm supports the emotional arc, though "voice cracking like thin ice" is a slightly standard simile for the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose creates strong rhythms ("spines fanned like sleeping gulls"), but the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("wander purposefully," "hiding behind truth") creates mechanical artifacts. These distinct repetitions break the immersive quality and draw attention to the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the imagery is often striking, the prose struggles to integrate the prompt phrases naturally. Constructions like “could still wavelength align with purpose” read as grammatical errors, and the repetition of static phrases (“understanding static bursts”) creates mechanical drag.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density ("boots grinding quartz dust"). A single cliché ("felt absurdly like a tear, though reapers cannot cry") stands out as a minor blemish in an otherwise freshly written piece.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with a strong control of pacing during the drop-counting sequence. However, occasional abstract metaphors ("stitched from rust and regret") and explanatory phrases ("Not with decay, but with rebirth") clutter the imagery and reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("gave one last metallic sigh"). Imagery is precise ("slicing through the twilight"), and sentence structures vary purposefully to control the pacing of the descent and return.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from high adjective density and occasional purple phrasing ("tongs of braided silver and song," "wings slicing sunlight into ribbons"). The scaffolding of "Logic said... Intuition answered" feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is marred by tautology ("remembering through muscle memory") and the repetitive overuse of the "soundless echo" motif, which appears three times. These artifacts clutter the prose and dull the momentum of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally dense and propulsive, but reliance on abstract nouns ("ego death," "numbness") and the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase ("slices through pretense") create minor textural drag.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is often striking ("clicked like anxious teeth," "walls swelling like gills"), contributing to a strong textural quality. However, prompt-mandated phrases are sometimes shoehorned in awkwardly ("notably receptive skin," "vegetal pulse"), creating momentary stumbles in an otherwise smooth flow.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally evocative, but "macerated" is semantically strained in its usage, and the close repetition of "ridiculous/ridiculousness" creates a rhythmic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically strong and evocative, but leans heavily on extended metaphors ("commas," "marginalia," "footnotes") that can feel precious or overwrought. The density of figurative language occasionally creates a barrier to immediacy, though the execution is mechanically polished.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant artifact penalties apply for the verbatim repetition of three different prompt phrases within a short space. The recurrence of words like "bloom" (5 times) and "frozen" creates a repetitive texture that dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from occasional overwriting and cliché (e.g., "tears blurred the dials," "pregnant with every voice"). Some metaphors, like "crickets that had learned grammar," feel precious rather than clarifying.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose has strong rhythm and density, but relies on a few "literary" clichés ("tasted like salt and regret," "moon dripped like melting silver") that dilute the otherwise sharp imagery. The "stalactites knitting together like fingers" is a standout original image that balances the weaker metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from heavy simile density ("like origami," "like smoke," "like dandelion seeds") and a noticeable template cadence with the refrain "as memories alter..." appearing three times. These artifacts, alongside "tasted like nostalgia" type abstractions, create a dense but occasionally purple texture.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from a "text artifact" loop: the phrase "somber marvel" is repeated four times and "unfolded horizons" three times, creating a noticeable pattern that dulls the writing. Additionally, the physics error regarding breath fogging water undercuts the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally lush but stumbles on critical metaphors. Describing a voice as "calm as fibrillation" is a semantic contradiction (fibrillation is chaotic/quivering) that undermines the medical precision of the premise. Several similes ("slept like organ-donor coolers") feel strained and overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong and evocative, though it occasionally lapses into overwrought metaphors like "speed of regret" or "hush... texture of relief" that blur clarity. Sentence rhythm is good, but the reliance on abstract descriptions of the "signal" sometimes distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished and dense with strong imagery. A few moments veer into overwriting (the list “dendrites of regret, axons of almost, synapses of maybe” feels slightly manufactured), but the overall rhythm and precision are high.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and strong rhythm ("ink forgot"). However, there is a register clash between the primeval setting ("knapped-flint," "funeral pots") and specific industrial metaphors ("corduroy riverbed," "phonograph"). While evocative, these anachronisms distract slightly from the immersive ancient aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of distinctive phrases ("frostbitten hope," "gravitationally playful," "cosmic joke" each appear 3 times), creating a scaffolded feel. Additionally, a clear grammar error ("had metamorphose into") disrupts the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and imaginative, with strong sonic imagery ("gears chewing on silence"). A few phrases lean toward the ornate or synesthetic overload ("tasted of iron and apricot," "language of shimmer") which occasionally blurs clarity, but the line-level craft is generally strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery, maintaining a strong rhythm. However, some metaphors border on purple ("flickering like dying stars," "whispering coordinates the way other men pray"), slightly cluttering the line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and high metaphor density that obscures clarity (e.g., "curved like a comma punctuating the sentence of the sky," "vines threading down like green notes on a staff of starlight"). Clichés like "time itself seemed to pause" and abstract phrasing like "lullaby of almost" weaken the line-level impact. The reliance on decorative similes often stalls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is readable but relies on "purple" adjective-noun pairings ("quantum lullabies," "stellar sonnets," "unborn languages") and technical jargon used as magic words. The repetition of the tag "sanely eccentric" acts as a minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density (e.g., "tide tongues licked basalt runes," "match struck in a cathedral of salt") that clogs narrative momentum. The constant figurative layering distracts from the action, violating the preference for clarity and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally high density, but "tumblers of fear" is a stock metaphor that weakens the climax. The triple repetition of "improbable longing" reads as a repetitive text artifact rather than a deepening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally strong and evocative, but stumbles into abstraction with phrases like "air tasted of crisp nostalgia," which conflates sensory detail with abstract labeling. The line-level craft is polished, though the reliance on prompt phrases as descriptors occasionally disrupts the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm ("clockwise once, counter twice") and high information density. However, the repetition of defining resilience ("Resilience sounds like...", "Resilience is...") borders on rhetorical redundancy, slightly stalling the momentum in favor of statement rather than letting the image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on adjective-dense phrasing ("verdant parapet," "insatiably creative," "liquid light"). A distracting artifact or typo ("tentonic, then torrential") disrupts the climax. The usage of "succor" ("succor the fading hue") feels forced and archaic, prioritizing sound over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, suffering from a density of similes (fracture lines like fault lines, silence like water, sigh tasting of salt, knots like mouths) that clogs the pacing. This "purple prose" obscures the action and feels performative rather than precise. The relentless figurative language violates the economy and clarity required for high-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but incredibly dense with figurative language (e.g., "scream wearing silence," "pulse older than grief"). While evocative, this metaphor density occasionally slows momentum and draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in images like "wings iced with static." A few metaphors feel slightly overwritten or mixed ("exhaled a silver balloon," "unfurls its fingers"), but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric weight well.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by the distracting repetition of unique phrases ("driftingly alert" x4, "ghost in code" x3) within a short word count, creating a mechanical rhythm. While some imagery is strong, the density of adjectives and the clumsy insertion of required terms stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and striking imagery ("anguish dressed in confetti"). A few metaphors feel slightly strained or over-ornamental ("repeating like breath," "molten sigh"), but the rhythm and flow are generally excellent and support the magical realism tone.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the imagery is lush, a severe syntax error in the final sentence ("memorialize in mid-air" instead of "memorializing" or "a memorial") disrupts the closure beat. Additionally, the phrasing "filament glowed quietly explosive" is awkward and repetitive (filament/filament), marking a forced insertion of the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from a reliance on filter verbs ("she understands," "she realizes," "understanding finally") to deliver information. High-value moments are often summarized abstractly rather than dramatized through concrete action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("creaking like an old librarian"). However, some phrasing leans into purple abstraction ("translations of light in seventeen dead dialects") that prioritizes sound over semantic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from overwriting, such as the mixed metaphor "doubt hissed like thawing steel" and some repetitive cadences. While the imagery is strong, the density of figurative language sometimes slows the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally evocative, but the specific phrase "brambled hope" is repeated three times, becoming a distracting artifact rather than a subtle motif. This repetition names the emotion rather than trusting the reader to feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and rich ("drank the orange afterglow"), successfully building a heavy, dreamlike atmosphere. At times, the figurative language becomes slightly stacked ("veins of mercury pumping beneath numerals that bled"), but the rhythm remains propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally evocative and high-density ("frost-brittle grass," "tasting iron and pine"). However, a few metaphors lean toward the ornate ("tiny white nooses," "prayers nobody taught them"), creating slight textural drag in an otherwise tight narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the imagery is lush, the sentence structure suffers from repetitive subject-verb openers ("She turned," "She began," "She climbed," "She poured"). The density of similes ("like a translucent fingernail," "like river foam," "like fossilized moonlight") occasionally clogs the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally exquisite and dense with imagery, though occasional moments strain for effect (e.g., "spiral notebooks of storm" feels slightly mixed against the glass aesthetic). One sentence ("glinting with the same glimmering parole that shimmered") suffers from a cluster of repetitive light/vision verbs that dulls the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished and dense, with evocative phrasing ("sandpaper these rough memories clean," "tongue against a broken tooth"). The rhythm supports the shift from the jagged, crunchy exterior to the fluid, oceanic interior. No significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("cradling... like a cold heart," "violins made of augers"). Rhythm is well-controlled. A few moments of telling ("Mireya’s gift was...") slightly mar the otherwise strong show-through-action approach.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly textured, with striking imagery ("watchmaker having seizures," "spilled mercury"). At times, the density of figurative language borders on overwriting (e.g., the density of metaphors in the climax), but it generally serves the surreal nature of the experience. Momentum is maintained despite the descriptive weight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong momentum ("fingers brushing stone, counting heartbeats"). The repetition of the required phrases ("clandestinely luminous" x3, "manuscript margin doodle" x3) creates a slight scaffold effect, but the surrounding sentences are polished and rhythmically varied.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    Two significant proofreading errors ("reclaimed copper reclaimed," "Ilay keeps strum") break the immersion and disqualify the piece from the highest tier of polish. While the imagery is often strong, these slips in a short piece are conspicuous.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is overwrought with abstract adjectives and "purple" descriptions ("vast, aching absence," "electromagnetic whispers"). Reliance on "telling" emotions ("hopeful melancholy") instead of showing them weakens the impact. There is a tendency toward template cadence in the descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density and "purple" description ("boots creaking like polite applause," "tears arrived without percussion"). These artifacts obscure clarity and slow momentum. Phrasing like "descriptive fingertips" creates semantic confusion, prioritizing sound over sense.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm is generally good, but the use of "journalized" as a verb is clunky, and the "helpful narrator" explains the theme directly, reducing density. These artifacts disrupt the otherwise lush prose and lower the line-level craft score.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is dense and effective ("roots easing free," "silver threads"), driving strong momentum. However, the phrase "whirling silence" repeats as a static label, and the closing "fireworks of yes" veers into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and atmospheric, with strong image-focused density ("boots crunching on broken glass," "halos that drifted like jellyfish"). A few similes (e.g., "like a starter pistol") are functional but less arresting than the story's more original descriptions. The rhythm supports the pacing well, accelerating during the survey and slowing for the plaza encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, rich with sensory crossover (&quot;fossilized sunrise,&quot; &quot;warm cider harmony&quot;). At times the density of adjectives and metaphors threatens to stall momentum—it is a confection of imagery—but it remains legible and high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, but the prompt insertion "an avalanchingly quiet" creates a distracting grammatical error (adverb modifying a noun). While images like "dry earth drinks blood" land well, the "time pools like dead birds" simile feels slightly strained and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and high-density, though it occasionally tips into overwrought metaphor ("eigenvalues of sorrow," "lucid turbulence"). While the imagery is generally striking, the relentless figurative language creates a slight "purple" texture that distances the reader from the physical action in moments. No loop artifacts or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    While grammatically clean, the prose is marred by excessive repetition of prompt terms. Variations of "germinate" appear five times, "coax wonder" three times, and "jittery" four times in a short space, creating a distracting echo that undermines the literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished but suffers from high figurative density, with metaphors packed into nearly every beat ("spinning like a galaxy," "frozen lightning," "bruised violets"). While evocative, this relentless lyricism sometimes slows momentum. Prompt phrases like "when assumptions shatter" feel slightly welded-in rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is often striking ("words pooled... like cooling iron"), but the specific prompt phrase "stoically sparkling" is repeated twice (paragraphs 7 and 21), creating a noticeable text artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose flow is severely damaged by the repetitive looping of abstract phrases ("azure defiance," "bartered awakenings," "understanding and confusion"), creating a template-like cadence. The density of abstract nouns over concrete verbs results in a "purple" texture that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and sensory precision. The required phrase "cyclically spontaneous" is inserted twice and feels slightly mechanical and clunky against the otherwise polished texture ("trapped cicada... flashing emerald signals").

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    While rhythmically strong, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought metaphor ("glass lenses hung like frozen tears," "sound was the feeling of safety"). The phrase "warmly observant eyes read" attributes agency to a body part, a clunky construction that weakens the line. The density is high, but some figurative language feels decorative rather than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally evocative but occasionally stumbles into density issues and mixed metaphors (e.g., "whale remembering harpoons forged from obsolete type"). The repetition of the phrase "Accidentally prophetic" feels slightly mechanical rather than rhythmic, creating a minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive scaffolding and artifact loops. Complex phrases like "quietly explosive" (4 uses), "valley-mist wonder" (3 uses), and "iridescent caution" (3 uses) are repeated verbatim within a short space, creating a jarring, algorithmic cadence. This repetition creates a dense, overwrought texture that obscures the clarity of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in lines like "brass limbs twisted like a dead spider." The rhythm supports the ritualistic pacing, and the imagery creates a cohesive aesthetic without relying on repetitive loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is high-density and generally evocative, but suffers from a noticeable grammar error in the integration of the prompt phrase ("songs that knits"). Occasional tendency toward "purple" description ("phosphor that stung like remembered joy") slightly dampens the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished but dense with figurative language that occasionally borders on "purple" (e.g., "folding noise into the spines," "seconds into silk"). While evocative, the relentless poeticism slows momentum and draws attention to the writer's hand rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is dense and often evocative but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("creeping normality" x4, "uncloak" x3) and clunky integration of required elements. The usage of "heuristically gentle" as a trailing modifier is grammatically awkward and breaks the flow twice. Some metaphors ("ovens had exhaled it") border on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose density is high and rhythmic, with evocative imagery like "wound matching a wound" driving the tone. A few metaphors risk being slightly overwrought ("dandruff from a dying god"), but the overall line-level craft supports the story's gravity without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Imagery is vivid and dense ("fish gutted on deck," "bruised lavender"), though the exact repetition of "comforting unease" constitutes a minor phrasing loop. The text ends abruptly with a comma, a mechanical flaw that mars an otherwise polished manuscript.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is overwritten, heavily relying on oxymoronic adjective strings ("terrestrially cosmic," "futuristic nostalgia") that obscure meaning. The density of figurative language ("presidency of autumn") impedes momentum and reads as decorative artifact rather than propulsive description.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and high-density but suffers from metaphorical overcrowding (e.g., "uncorked suppressed creativity like champagne under a sword"). The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("charcoal-fingered," "auroral sorrow," "dried blood") creates a rhythm that occasionally feels manufactured.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense and polished, with strong imagery and rhythmic control ("shredded treasure map... fluttered like moth wings"). A few filter verbs ("She understood," "She realized") distance the reader slightly from the epiphany, but the line-level craft is otherwise high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    "Overdosed her ears" is a jarring register clash; metaphors like "sweating cold diamonds" feel cliché and overwritten. The high density of adjectives and abstract phrasing slows momentum without adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but repetitive, with "strangely organic" appearing three times and "childhood fears" four times, creating a scaffolded feel. The climax leans into purple prose ("flames writing the children's names"), which distracts from the physical immediacy of the burn.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans toward purple description ("darkness breathing," "storm of rumor"). The density is high, though the figurative language sometimes draws attention to itself over the image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("voice braided with bubbles," "silver sigh"), creating density that sometimes prioritizes poetic sound over narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from repetition and mixed metaphors. The phrase "gleaming silence" appears three times, becoming a distracting artifact rather than a motif. Phrasing like "scattering the gravity like broken glass" strains the physical logic of the metaphor, and the ending drifts into a list-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the prose is generally lush, the piece suffers from severe "synonym churn" artifacts due to the triple repetition of complex phrases ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush"). These repetitions feel like checklist insertions rather than organic choices, disrupting the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly polished and rhythmically distinct, though the metaphor density is extremely high ("dactyls of fire," "eyes carried constellations"), occasionally bordering on preciousness. Despite this, the imagery remains consistently coherent within the story's established logic of "building grammar."

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong with high density and propulsive rhythm ("soft as funeral clothes"). However, it occasionally lapses into abstract descriptors or prompt-forced phrasing ("tragically radiant") that feels slightly ornamental. The description of the "resonance structures" leans into technobabble that clashes slightly with the organic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers severely from repetitive artifact phrases; "calibrated treason" appears five times and "key with no apparent lock" four times in a short space, creating a mechanical, incantatory rhythm. This repetition acts as a scaffold that dulls the reading experience, prioritizing phrase-insertion over organic flow. The reliance on telling ("she understood," "she remembered") distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("tasted of salt and dawn"), though the insertion of the technical phrase "progressive disclosure" creates a register clash with the fable-like atmosphere. Line-level rhythm is otherwise strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally dense with "purple" metaphors ("tasted like salt and forgiveness," "planetarium of collective sorrow") that obscure sensory clarity. There are no major technical errors, but the reliance on abstract descriptors reduces physical immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft shows flashes of brilliance ("seven pale fireflies of water") but is weighed down by adjective stacking and forced terminology. The prose occasionally prioritizes lyrical density over clarity, leading to moments of overwriting that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm; metaphors like the "slow-motion printing press" and "ghost tides" enhance the mood without stalling momentum. The line-level craft supports the story's tension without falling into repetitive loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally strong but occasionally strains for effect with mixed or overwrought metaphors ("whimsy bubbling up like blood"). Some phrases lean towards abstraction ("bomb from radio parts and regret") which, while fitting the tone, sacrifices concrete clarity for style.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically sound, but density is an issue; metaphors are packed tight ("wind slithered," "gulls preached," "redeemed... brush her ribs like a cat"). The figurative language occasionally obscures the literal mechanics of the scene, risking "purple prose" artifacts without causing a causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally vivid and sensory-rich ("teeth filed into frequencies," "micro-shrieks"). However, the integration of prompt phrases ("fleshly ethereal," "logically emotional") creates slight rhythm bumps, reading as inserted artifacts rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory imagery is vivid ("stone exhale cold," "sanded the graphite dust"), but a reliance on "like" simile structures (seven instances) creates a repetitive syntactic cadence that distracts from the otherwise polished prose.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    Use of a cliché at a peak emotional beat ("hit like a train") and the grammatical error in the prompt phrase ("lantern from underground railroad" missing an article) mar the prose. Filter verbs weaken immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from visible prompt-forcing. The phrase "aptly deliberate" appears twice ("voice aptly deliberate," "money aptly deliberate") in awkward constructions that break immersion. "Vibrant hush" also repeats as a bookend, which works better but adds to the repetitive feel. These artifacts, along with some purple phrasing ("illuminating nothing if not spent on life"), distract from otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory imagery ("tasted of copper and ozone"). While a few phrases feel slightly heavy ("gears-and-cogs workshop"), the rhythm is generally excellent and the technical vocabulary blends seamlessly with the poetic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has momentum but suffers from repetitive simile structures ("pulsed like dying stars," "rattled like a dying hard drive") within a short span. Some metaphors feel dense and slightly purple ("tattoo her dreams"), which occasionally distracts from the clarity of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose leans toward overwriting with adjective stacking ("shadow-laced," "bruise-colored") and ornamental phrasing. While the imagery is rich, the density of modification slows momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from metaphor density (&quot;chime thinner than moonlight,&quot; &quot;tasted of salt and lullabies&quot;) that obscures clarity with abstract poeticism. Repetitive phrasing of prompt elements (&quot;fold in patience&quot; x4, &quot;grips reality loosely&quot; x2) creates a noticeable echo that feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is competent, but the insertion of the prompt phrase "intersubjective understanding" constitutes a significant register artifact that disrupts flow. Some metaphors are stacked too densely (autumn/fermentation/stars/fruit), reducing clarity in favor of ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose relies heavily on abstract noun phrases ("paradox of movement," "raw substance") and familiar literary metaphors ("indifferent gaze," "trapped moths"). This abstraction creates a static texture that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.9)
    Basic grammatical errors distract significantly (e.g., "Every Saturday she linger here" subject-verb disagreement; "The archivist perceptively calm, simply nodded" missing verb/punctuation). The prose is also overwritten with dense, sometimes mixed metaphors that clutter the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is functional but suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("She began," "She stood," "She left") that flatten the rhythm. Filter verbs ("She noticed," "She understood") distance the reader from the immediate experience. The phrase "sonically reflective" reads as technical jargon that clashes with the story's otherwise lyrical and mystical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from modifier density ("precognitively forgetful," "imperceptible frequency," "momentary monuments"). The reliance on adjective-noun pairings and occasional explanatory phrases slows the rhythm and distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.5)
    Heavy penalty for text loops: the phrase "luminous ache" appears four times and "changelessly constant" twice in a short text, creating a distracting echo. Metaphor density is high ("like a trapped moth," "like old paint," "like diaphragm blades"), occasionally obscuring clarity with purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and musical, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("silence to grow teeth"). The repetition of the specific phrase "decisively kind" (twice) feels like a slightly mechanical insertion of a required tag rather than an organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("iris diaphragms widening like memory," "constellations poured like liquid"), effectively supporting the atmosphere without lapsing into purple confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high density and metaphorical clutter ("haloed by errors," "apology choking in smoke"). While evocative, the relentless figurative language occasionally obscures the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from repetitive scaffolding ("Memories resurfaced as memories do" / "Memories resurfaced again"). Required phrases like "reflectively vibrant" and "zephyr bloom cool" are inserted awkwardly, creating clunky modifiers that break the line-level elegance. The "job completed" phrasing also disrupts the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" overwriting and mixed metaphors ("rust spread to her tongue"). Phrases like "honeyed hush thickened" and "jeans-torn knees" prioritize sound over clarity. The prompt phrases are inserted as direct modifiers ("quietly proactive," "vulnerably protected"), creating clunky, tell-not-show constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but the reliance on book-related similes (marginalia, quotation marks, proofs, pages) becomes repetitive. While thematic, the relentless mapping of the environment to writing terms risks feeling contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetitive artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "spun golden stories" appears three times verbatim, and "golden ratio" appears twice. The sentence structure is often breathless and overburdened with adjective-noun pairings ("weathered fingers," "ancient anticipation," "bioluminescent runes"), reducing density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory detailing. However, it relies on some stock poetic tropes ("apple skeletons raised black arms," "reverently") and the repetition of "world holds its breath" creates a slight drag rather than a deepening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting and artifact issues. The density of similes (10+ "like [X]" constructions) stalls momentum, and the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("wounded season," "peripherally focused") three times each reads as a checklist constraint rather than narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is evocative but marred by the awkward, likely forced phrasing of "boundary-lessly trapping" and the rigid repetition of the full phrase "kerosene lamp burner." These artifacts create minor rhythm bumps in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.5)
    Major tense inconsistencies disqualify this from immediate publication. The narrative oscillates confusingly between past and present ("loft hummed... while the kettle boils," "kettle clicked off... while the kettle cools"), likely an artifact of forcing prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with strong rhythm. A few metaphors border on overwrought ("seasoning the cloudwater with emulsified dreams," "bride who lost her vowels"), calling attention to the writing rather than the moment. The line "regret is just empathy traveling backwards" is memorable but slightly aphoristic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is dense with mixed metaphors and "purple" phrasing ("zero-mass comet," "choked filters... attitudes of prayer") that distracts from clarity. The "Hope =" equation serves as a clichéd textual artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the prose shows craft ("frost feathered," "stuttered like a frightened sparrow"), the text suffers significantly from the repetitive insertion of specific phrases. "Excruciatingly gentle" and "glacial hush" appear four times each in a short space, creating a template cadence and synonym churn that dulls the closure image and feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from high metaphorical density that occasionally obscures clarity ("discrepancy rang like a cracked bell," "blueprint," "quake"). More critically, the forced, verbatim repetition of complex prompt phrases (e.g., "serene upheaval" x3) creates a stuttering, artificial rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is dense and often evocative, but it suffers from repetitive phrasing (the required attribute "infinitely patient" is used three times as a crutch). There is also a tendency toward metaphor stacking ("time accordion," "spring tide") that momentarily obscures clarity during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished but frequently overwrought, relying on abstract noun phrases ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing") that tell rather than show. There is a tendency toward interpretive bridging ("In that moment of intimate recognition") that explains the subtext instead of trusting the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is dense but suffers from mixed metaphors ("Morse of his own sobbing") and abstract phrasing that blurs physical logic. The required phrase "hypothesizing about everything" feels mechanically inserted.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.0)
    Severe overwriting via simile overload ("like kelp," "like guilty fingerprints," "like a listening heart," "like slow bruises," "like cooled lava," "like sprinkler heads") violates the density check. These artifacts clutter the prose and obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.5)
    A distinct template cadence disrupts the flow, with paragraphs beginning repetitively ("The first breadcrumb led...", "The second breadcrumb pulsed...", "The fourth breadcrumb led..."). This visible scaffolding draws attention to the formulaic structure, and the repetition of phrases like "sidereal patience" feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.7)
    While the prose is generally fluid, the verbatim repetition of unique phrases ("approximating infinity" x3, "troubling serenity" x2, "quiet sigh" x2) creates noticeable lexical loops. These artifacts make the prose feel mechanical and dull the emotional impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe pattern artifacts appear in the structural scaffold; the phrase "The spectral mentorship [began/revealed/intensified/reached]" starts four separate paragraphs, creating a distracting template cadence. Additionally, filter verbs ("noticed," "understood," "realized") distance the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Imagery is generally evocative ("obsidian teeth," "orange grief"), but the opening sentence suffers from an immediate "hissed/hissing" repetition loop. Additionally, the prompt phrase "searing reverie" is used twice, creating a slight repetitive drag that mars the otherwise high polish.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, though occasionally overwritten with stylized phrasing ("soft metallic kiss," "flutter through her ribs"). The density of imagery is high, helping to establish the dreamlike mood efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    While imagery is often strong, line-level craft is marred by the awkward insertion of required phrases ("groundedly imaginative" is a clumsy modifier) and repetitive phrasing ("skating on equations... initials into equations"). These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and polish expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery. At times, the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought (e.g., "uniforms shedding ash like pages turning," "eyes reflecting paragraphs"), creating a density that risks obscuring the physical action in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density and "writerly" artifacts, such as the forced zeugma of "tiles and grief" and clichés like "crystallized tears." The relentless figurative language in the final paragraph ("love is the powder," "safety is a mirage") creates a muddled, sermonizing effect that detracts from the scene's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("time is a gear that eats its own teeth"), but suffers from tonal breaks like "sewage-tasting micro-doses." These clunky explanatory phrases disrupt the otherwise carefully crafted abrasive calm of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose flows well but suffers from some overwrought metaphors ("gardeners weigh drought") and the awkward integration of prompt phrases. Specifically, "applied expectantly resigned" creates a grammatical stumble that disrupts the sentence's rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("stained-glass forgiveness," "edible scripture"), leading to density that slows momentum. The required scientific phrase "synaptic plasticity" clashes tonally with the otherwise magical diction, feeling inserted rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is polished, it relies heavily on simile-dense constructions ("like a proboscis," "like petrified sunflowers," "like tiny wings," "like copper bees"), creating a repetitive syntactic rhythm. Some descriptions, like "brass heart beat" and "varnish over wonder," feel slightly overwrought for the otherwise grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the imagery is rich, the syntax becomes monotonous with repetitive subject-verb openers ("She carried," "She paused," "Elara pressed," "She followed"). Additionally, the density of abstract similes ("like memory against bone," "like assembling a confession") occasionally feels overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose density is high with fresh, evocative imagery ("warm ink," "cautious purple flames") that serves the story's magical realism. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully to match the underwater movement, with no visible scaffolding or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control, particularly in the "counting backwards" sequence. The required phrase "balancedly daring" is the only slight friction in flow, though the narrative self-awareness ("felt briefly authored") skillfully mitigates its awkwardness.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is lush but hampered by an over-reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("smog-choked," "sour glow") that creates a static rhythm. High density of figurative language ("greenhouse felt like the inside of a throat") sometimes slows momentum and obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is marred by clichés ("cracked like thin ice," "tears and laughter," "heart broke") and heavy-handed metaphors ("frozen waterfalls of memory," "alchemy of displacement"). These artifacts distance the reader and obscure the concrete reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.2)
    Major deduction for severe lexical loops/scaffolding. The phrases "latent radiance" (5x), "bleak exhilaration" (4x), and "slow exhale" (3x) appear so frequently they read like prompt-insertion glitches rather than motifs. This synonym churn significantly obstructs the prose flow.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative ("silver talon frozen mid-snatch"), but occasionally overwrought with adjective-heavy phrases like "repulsive allure" and "lingering luminance." The density of metaphors in the middle section slows the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm in lines like "swung the mallet through empty space." A few prompt-mandated phrases (e.g., "fractal generating" used as a sentence starter) create minor syntactic friction, but the overall craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is vivid and specific ("harmonics that tasted of iron," "sighing dune"). However, the verbatim repetition of "sunwashed dread" (three variations) and "quietly driven" (twice) creates noticeable text loops that disrupt the otherwise polished prose.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Imagery is dense and evocative ("tightening its slow green edit"), showing strong line-level control. However, the forced usage of "emotionally rational" as a modifier creates a minor prose artifact that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information density is generally high, but specific artifacts mar the polish. The phrase "wrestling a larger stone to wrest from its socket" creates a distracting lexical echo. Additionally, the oxymoronic label "stoically sensitive" acts as a scaffold rather than an embodied trait.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("water dripping from chandeliers like slow applause"), with strong rhythm. However, the mandatory inclusion of "tranquilly perceptive" feels slightly forced and adjectival, appearing twice as a somewhat awkward modifier that disrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but the density of figurative language is relentless ("tears evaporated into minor constellations," "ribs holding a galaxy"). While individual images are striking, the sheer frequency of metaphors risks overwriting and occasionally crowds the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is often striking and high-density, such as "equations whose solutions could redirect missiles." However, the repetition of specific phrasing ("intangibly tangible," "intangibly real," "bleak exhilaration") feels mechanical and creates noticeable drag.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe repetition artifacts drag down the prose; the phrase "perpetually surprised" appears five times, and "brilliant dimness" twice, indicating a lack of line-level editing. Clichéd phrasing ("eyes that held galaxies," "captured lightning") reduces the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is evocative but marred by a critical continuity error (referring to the ancestor as both "her grandfather" and "her father") and repetitive diction ("cobalt" x4, "sieved hush" x2). The reliance on filter verbs ("He understood then," "Elias realized then") dulls the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high density. However, the figurative language occasionally muddles clarity or logic (e.g., "ink blooming like squid grief"—squids ink for defense, not grief). The metaphor density in the climax slightly obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from severe simile saturation (nine "like a..." constructions), which creates a dense, scaffolded texture that slows momentum. The required phrase "merrily melancholic" is repeated three times in a short space, creating a jarring, repetitive artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is rhythmically strong and information-dense, but the density of figurative language occasionally stifles immediacy ("spoke in pastels"). The required phrasing "delicately robust" appears twice and feels semantically forced ("delicately robust yearning"), creating a noticeable artifact that disrupts the line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and evocative ("cracked the night open like a pomegranate"), successfully sustaining the tone. At times, the density of figurative language threatens to slow the momentum of the ritual actions, but clarity is generally maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies and mixed metaphors (the fracture is a river, then a canyon, then a lightning bolt) that blur the visual logic. Phrases like "choking beauty" and "cathedral of vapor and regret" lean on abstraction over concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong imagery ("suicided Earth," "vines of light") that compresses backstory into texture. Some phrasing tilts toward the sentimental or purple ("bare feet barely kissing," "drinking the faint shimmer"), but the line-level momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is overwrought, relying on abstract metaphors and mixed imagery ("braided across obsidian," "yielded like skin"). Phrasing like "smelled of... forgotten promises" violates the show-don't-tell principle by using abstract concepts as sensory descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the prose has momentum, it suffers from noticeable artifacting and overwriting. The repetition of specific unique phrases ("calmly inventive," "winking hush") within a short space breaks immersion. Metaphors like "thin kites snagging on surprise" are mixed and abstract, reducing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm and word choice are generally polished, but the text suffers from logical inconsistencies at the line level (e.g., the friction description). Some imagery leans toward the abstract or cliché ("shimmering equations," "whale song crossed with crystal"), which dilutes the impact of the otherwise strong visual descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Technical control is high, though the metaphor density approaches overwriting (e.g., four distinct images in the opening sentence). The verbatim repetition of "furiously tranquil" acts as a refrain but feels slightly heavy-handed; however, the prose rhythm generally supports the "storm-kissed" atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with good attention to rhythm and imagery ("hydraulic grace," "foil singing"). There are minor instances of metaphor stacking (the needle card as a "bookmark," "raft," and "vessel") and some standard phrasing ("eyes widened"), but line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose craft is excellent, with high information density and vivid, original imagery ("pages scatter like startled doves," "tasting the bones"). The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the tension of the scene. The writing avoids major artifacts or loops, delivering a polished and propulsive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective-heavy modification (e.g., "reluctant pigeons," "brass corpse," "restless castanets," "cumulus pillows") that creates a rhythmic drag. The density of figurative language occasionally calls attention to the writer rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and strong rhythm, effectively balancing the fantastical elements with grounded action. The phrase "empirically whimsical" is slightly heavy, but the line-level craft is otherwise pristine, free of loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor density ("word... like a leaf," "stanza of silence," "piano notes," "passed through... like forgiveness"). This heavy figurative load slows momentum and leans toward "purple" styling rather than concrete immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with discovery—long sentence for data unfurling, fragment for “03:17.” Information density high: a single sentence slots butterfly scale growth into astrophysics. No mixed metaphors; “decay is a courtesy” is exact. Minor scaffold: “She breathed… feeling kindled humility” is tell-ish, but immediately embodied by boots crunching glass.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density, zero paraphrase loops, metaphors internally coherent (glass/molten light ↔ kiln re-heating). Rhythm modulates from staccato night beats to expansive dawn release. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; every adjective earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, emotion, or causation. Metaphors (brass rivers, string nebulae) extend the musical physics without contradiction. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates through the fork-scale run, then snaps into the single-sentence closure. No filter-verb clusters or purple overload; diction stays precise and concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from short pulse (“the metal accepted it with a maternal click”) to clause-stacked lyricism without algorithmic pattern. Mixed metaphors are strategic: “library sank, still aching for checkout” marries bureaucratic and nautical registers, justified by world logic. No loops or synonym churn; “occupying impossible spaces” recurs with reweighted meaning rather than padding. Closing line lands with rhythmic finality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes: paragraph lengths visually echo climb-descent cycle; no template cadence detected. Figurative control tight—“terra-cotta flakes glinted like dried blood” is single allowed simile, earned by arbor violence. Information density high: one sentence slips rice, oil, stories into cart load. No paraphrase loops; each sensory detail advances goal or stakes. Sentence variety supports momentum under 800-word cap.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—single sentences often do image + motive + motion (“petals drifting like slow fireworks through thick, foggy lucidity”). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: petals → lanterns → lantern-viaduct. One mixed-metor risk—“river water returning to the river”—but metaphoric logic holds within accumulative lens, never obscures causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with maze curvature—long horticultural clauses tighten into staccato door/dissolve. Figurative layering is dense yet every vehicle (burning film, cold smoke, serrated ring) returns to the central photographic ontology; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new sensory or causal information. Only a single filter verb cluster (“she understood then that…”) keeps this from 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with tension: long inhalations of description snap into staccato “Win a prize, gentlemen—if you dare.” Some scaffolding: “patient and strategic” is repeated thrice; “staggering grace” appears twice without new charge. Mixed metaphor risk—“brass band music” sunlight—yet cadence carries. No loops obscure closure; final line hums chord, resolving by image. Density is high but occasional modifier stacks (“iridescent cellophane peeled from forgotten teddy-bear prizes”) could trim.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, sensory translation, thematic tilt—without scaffold: “metal sang, and her device etched the waveform onto a flake of obsidian cooling at her feet.” One near-loop: “cells divide” is repeated at opening and near-end; because it frames biological inevitability the repetition reads purposeful rather than artifact. No mixed metaphors under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often stitches metaphor, backstory, and forward pressure—“the revelation should have felt like freedom, but it tasted of rust and camera-smoke.” No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (rusted library = old prop ship). Filter-verb use is minimal and voice-motivated. Final third avoids overwriting: “stars spilled through the holes like unpaid extras” is precise, not purple. One homophone risk—“reel” for “real” is intentional pun and passes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is high-density jewelry: one sentence often maps symbol, sensory body, and causal consequence (“she dipped the quill into it, trading motion for stillness one last time”). Mixed-metaphor risk is high yet coherent within amber/fossil/mineral logic. One paraphrase loop subtracts −0.2; no artifacts touch closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into monosyllabic final stroke then halts, earning the hush. Copy is clean; no scaffold beyond noted loop.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “steam rose… in slow spirals” does visual and clockwork work simultaneously. Figurative language is sparse and controlled; no mixed metaphors. Single template cadence loop (“the day before, and the day before that”) is intentional, foregrounds temporal recursion. Filter-verb count near zero; strong verbs (“pushed,” “crunched,” “drew”) propel. Final sentence breath-length mirrors the 43-second countdown, tightening exit rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long sentence for dust-plankton calm, staccato for gate-locking dawn. Information density high—ticket, lens, prank, absolution packed without scaffold. One near-loop: “resonant hush” repeated but reweighted at closure, hence forgiven. Metaphors (snow upward, cloak of trust) are coherent, not contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold. Information density is high: one sentence often marries sensory detail, backstory, and forward motion (“Biting into it, she tasted every season…”). Metaphors are coherent—marbles as constellation, apple as calendar—never mixed. Rhythm accelerates during maze walk, slows during polish ritual, matching pulse of attention. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line resolves by image. Minor hedged preposition (“like forgotten promises”) is the only filler; otherwise every clause advances story or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but never stalls: every sentence layers image, physiology, and concept (“glass pinions,” “holographic principles,” “paper fan” decades). Mixed-metaphor risk is carefully managed—vehicles stay within techno-organic register. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt,” “she realized,” “she understood”) arrives mid-climax; it slightly dulls immediacy but is compressed into three lines, not a stack. Final line cadence—cutting on “or” without completing the conditional—is a risky fragment that lands as Charged Poise, justifying its break.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence advances image, stakes, or acoustics; no scaffolding. Figurative language is internally coherent—water metaphors sustain rather than clutter. Occasional lyrical stretchers (“sea of musical notes that transformed into fish”) risk purple but stay purposeful to sonic theme. Final line lands clean, no loops; cadence slows to mirror dawn hush.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Wind rattled the anemometer cups; they clacked like rosary beads counting down to revelation.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“green ropes dragging violet scars”—reads as auroral synesthesia, not muddle. Final third clean, allowing 9+ proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm alternates between long breath and staccato micro-movements, echoing drip-Morse timing; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high yet each metaphor (damp wool hush, lead slug, brass rosary) is concrete, non-contradictory, and paid off in closure image. Information per sentence is double-loaded: “She flicked her headlamp on, the beam catching a beaded valve wheel half-buried in silt, its brass nipples glinting…” simultaneously advances action, describes, and primes religious callback. No loops or paraphrase; pronoun reference remains unambiguous despite frequent tactile nouns. Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line resolves by image that recharges gyroscope motif.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences layer ink, stone, breath, silence. Figurative language is patterned—folds, cracks, pools—paid off at closure. No mixed metaphors; “library breathed” extends prior vegetative imagery. Two minor template cadences—“across the drift of untold seasons” repeated—read as liturgical echo, justified by theme. No loops or scaffold obscure causality; mirror-water image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “a question mark of newborn light” compresses three metaphor layers without choking clarity. One paraphrase loop—“the note was neither major nor minor, simply the interval between heartbeats”—repeats concept already implied, but it occurs mid-ascension, not at closure, so −0.3 only. Read-aloud ear is strong; commas breathe like rests in scored silence. No artifact touches the exit image, keeping 9 band in reach.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines carry double duty—description seeds future use: “reclaimed concrete” foreshadows blank canvas; “copper glow” foretells bronze quiet. Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles); only one paraphrase loop (“walls could tell their own story” echoes earlier “stories walls have heard”) but it serves closure cadence. No filter-verb stacks; high information density. Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent. Minor template repetition in “she...” openers does not obscure causality or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are purposeful (echo as rosary, ribs as whale bones). One coherence slip: “colorless color” is a paradox that works conceptually but edges toward purple if read literally; however, it is paid off at closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadences. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short fragments at climax, longer coils during exposition—earning its high band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances or deepens. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: the inverted night dial returns in the ordinary drop that “touches the surface,” completing the metaphor circuit. Information density is high—e.g., “seventeen identical arches, each inscribed with a different name for the same sin” compresses theme, stake, and spatial cue in one line. No register drift; lexicon stays within the mythic register the piece teaches.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Dense doubling—e.g., “backward recorded songs could unwind memory, let hidden voices speak in reverse against grief’s forward march”—carries two ideas without scaffold. One strained metaphor: “goatskin stretched like moonlit lakes” is borderline purple but fits the cavern’s hush. Zero paraphrase loops, zero synonym churn, no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Final line earns its quiet cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence can anchor place, body, and tool (“She slipped the vellum into her pocket, shouldered her satchel of barometers, and began to move”). Metaphors stay physical—sky “bruised,” lichen “pulse”—avoiding purple. A single paraphrase loop (“pigeon feathers… pigeon had trained here”) is minor; no artifact touches the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—ultraviolet cathedral, stained-glass petals—never mixed or contradictory. Information density is high: one drop of liquid carries bed-mornings, burnt sugar, hospital bracelet in a single capillary pulse. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from slow reluctant ribbon to sharp metallic note, mirroring emotional crest.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose density is high—almost every line layers image + stakes + sensory texture. Rhythm modulates: cumulative anaphora (“I walked… I sang…”) accelerates exit without monotony. Metaphors stay coherent (starlight as asphalt heat, rope as time) and don’t stack into purple clutter. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; opening and closing images bookend cleanly. Minor over-adjectiving in “color of dried blood” but occurs in low-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breatheable: “soot-streaked but intact” does three jobs in four words. Metaphors stay physical—masts “leaning like tired listeners”—never mixing vehicles. Occasional elevated flourish (“chronic hush of something forever unsaid”) borders purple but is earned by repetition that reframes the hush as instrument. No loops or paraphrase detected; rhythm modulates with bow pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: “the scent bloomed like a bruise—honeyed regret, sharp with the citrus of almost-joy” compresses three jobs—metaphor, sensory specificity, emotional contradiction—into one sentence. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates from long resinous inhalations to the clipped final “It didn’t matter anymore.” Metaphors stay coherent within olfactory/earth register; no mixed vehicles. Final line “But a beginning” is monosyllabic cadence payoff, not algorithmic pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from stacked participles to blunt broker declaratives; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative density is high yet patterned (tide, freight, music) and pays off in final “symphony still reverberated in the hush between heartbeats.” Minor elevated diction (“clerestory,” “conceptual repricing”) fits reflective beats without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “glyph would not come; her lungs felt sewn shut by doubt” layers physical, emotional, and symbolic blockage in one stroke. Rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and clipped revelations, mirroring orchard chimes. Zero paraphrase loops; each descriptor (peat-sap, moonstone, starlight) returns with new functional weight. One near-muddle: “boldly sympathetic ache” is adhesive diction—both adjectives serve similar emotional color—but it occupies a single line and does not infect closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are propulsive. Figurative layering is dense but patterned early, paid off at closure. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; “handwriting of an interrupted cadence” marries sound and visuals cleanly. High information density with zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Figurative density is high but patterned: every metaphor (crystal fruit, twin moons, tectonic tiles) is revisited and reweighted at closure. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay geological/optical. Minor scaffold: “the way an equation balances…” could compress. Final third is artifact-free, propelling into the starlight pool image without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety is virtuosic: participial openers for stealth (“Moving through...”), noun-phrase telescopes for memory (“A lullaby, a recipe, a bar-mitzvah stumble”), abrupt declaratives for exposure (“She sees me”). No scaffold loops; each reel mention adds new sensory angle rather than synonym churn. Metaphor density is high but patterned—lanterns, moths, constellations—so the final “constellation of voices” feels earned, not last-minute ornament. Minor overworld filter-verb cluster in “he felt the fragments stirring” could have been cut to heighten immediacy, but it lands outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “leaves curled inward during thunderstorms in a behavior her textbooks couldn’t explain” packs world, character, and stakes in one clause. No loops or synonym churn; mixed metaphors are avoided. One near-purple phrase—“creatures from deep ocean trenches”—is forgiven because it occurs at the height of disorientation and is immediately grounded by tactile fall into trellis. Final line cadence mirrors sap-throb, earning rhythmic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with sentence-length modulation; no template cadence. Figurative density peaks during fresco description yet stays anchored to physical logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor register lift in “unearthed convergence” is earned by context and paid off at closure. No scaffold or filler; pronoun tracking clean across tidal movement.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breatheable; sentences open with limestone scrape, chime, nacre swirl—information multiplexing without padding. One mixed-metaphor edge: “abyssal pits below” beside “glass-darkness” costs a hairline slip. No loops, no scaffold, final line cadence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless anaphora against short surgical fragments; no template cadence detected. Metaphors interlock—cobblestone words, mast sentences—without mixed logic; each image advances knowledge or pressure. Information density high: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold; punctuation and tense stable. Final trumpet sentence achieves propulsive release without overwriting, meeting the 9+ quick test cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density: “punch clacked once, notching the air” does three jobs. No mixed metaphors; cedar/mist holds. Rhythm breathes—long sentence then fragment. Only scaffold: “cracks in pavement forming arrows” repeated verbatim three times; tight space, still audible.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences lengthen then clip to mirror breath-beat of whales. Metaphors stay precise—astrolabe as tuning fork, tile as keel stone—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, thematic work. Only scaffold: “like an unheard symphony” appears twice within 30 words; paraphrase loop −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft: metaphor density high yet coherent—images stack but obey internal physics (crystalline corridors, solar flares licking panes). No loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new sensory or causal information. Strong verbs—“folded,” “licked,” “hooked,” “peel”—propel without adverb clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“vermilion,” “escondite”) justified by immortal POV. Final clause “hollows of his formerly infinite heart” lands as closure image, no mixed metaphor, rhythm breath-held then released.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“granite policies” returns as “granite liquefy”) and paid off. Syntax varies: fragment “Trade requires disclosure” acts as detonator click; longer sentence unfurls policy amendments. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line resolves by image that recharges blood-as-ink motif. Clean grammar, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Density is extreme—almost every sentence layers metaphor, sensory data, and plot advance—yet maintains clarity because each image is rooted in a tactile prop (notepad, lamp, wire). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; “luminescence,” “static,” “velvet” recur only when meaning has shifted. One mixed-metaphor risk: “light restrained by fog, sound restrained by absence” could read abstract, but the next clause grounds it in bark texture. The final ash-snow image lands clean, propelling the thematic reprice without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: “paper said so—yet her heart hammered” packs contradiction + action. Figurative language is selective—containers “groaned like whales” once, pattern-taught early, paid off at closure. No synonym churn; “rusted walls,” “salt shadow,” “sodium light” all serve distinct sensory slots. One minor template cadence: “she…she…she” in descent paragraph, but it mimics ladder rhythm and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm mirrors musical phrasing: long sentences arc like drawn notes, fragments snap like bow lifts. No loops; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Metaphors are coherent—”spruce ribs gleaming like a half-dug coffin” sustains wood/death dualism without mixed vehicle. Information density high: one line delivers micro-setting, sensory taste, and foreshadows shell-coffin resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is dense yet buoyant: single sentences perform world, metaphor, and plot (“corporate teal…surveyors’ orange”). No loops or scaffold; each clause advances. Metaphors stay coherent—stone as bell, city as unreadable text—without mixed collisions. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor overwrite: “投射的火花” is untranslated fire that may jolt anglophone ear, but the flare is brief and thematically apt, so penalty stays sub-0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “molten silica drawn from her kiln” does triple duty—material, heat, skill. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent: “iron filings sliding into perfect order” sustains magnetic calm motif. One near-mixed image—“oceanic horn”—but context salvages it.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long sensorial sweeps and abrupt, breath-held fragments that mimic cold shock. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“lake stretched like a shattered mirror,” “walls ribbed like throat cartilage”—no mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence can advance plot, reveal backstory winter count, and seed spiral motif (“dog-eared corner… between maps… the only thing her predecessor left”). Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new angle or texture. Clarity never sacrifices lyric urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors are coherent—“smoke that had forgotten how to rise” extends to bells that forgot to ring—no mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence can anchor time, body, tool, and emotional void. Opening and closing lines act as tuning strikes, creating audible bookends. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls like bell swell, never mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is high-density yet breathable; every sentence advances atmosphere or tactic. Metaphors are coherent under water logic: “stone tendrils,” “organ… heart that had forgotten its rhythm.” No scaffold loops; no synonym churn. Peak beat—“She uncorked the crystal perfume vial. The lilac drop drifted out…”—is crystalline, uncluttered. Minor waiver: “slowmotion thunder” risks purple, but cadence demands the slackening.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—“lattice from confessional—pried from the chapel the night keepers vanished—was wrapped in oilcloth” does triple duty. No mixed metaphors; copperlight stays consistent across visual, tactile, moral valence. Minor scaffold: “the hush was a living thing, coiling, fleeing” repeats concept twice in adjacent clauses—−0.2; does not touch closure. Pronoun refs clean; no synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: copper pipes exhale steam / feeding pomegranate trees that bore fruit of molten silver—one line, three jobs. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (smoke, vine, bell). Peak beat clarity preserved: “Light poured from his mouth, from the fruit, from her absent eyes” —triple source, single rope image. Minor over-figuration in early orchard description does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates: fossilized petals / boots crunch / sundial base pulses—three stressed beats that echo heartbeat. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory layer or causal cue. Metaphors are coherent: “reluctant mouth” for gate, “clay drums” for skulls—both extend setting logic. One near-muddle: “time had not forgotten this place even if the gods had” skirts abstraction, but is saved by embodied shadow proof two lines later.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—one sustained chalk/spiral metaphor—never obscuring causality. Information density high: “clipboard trembled” does emotive and plot work. Zero scaffolding; every clause advances image, pressure, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Information density is high: “playful comets that were, to any trained eye, precise vectors” does three jobs—character voice, foreshadowing, world rule. Metaphors stay coherent (mirror galaxies, cloth sky) without mixed vehicles. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating ear-echo closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned—moon, salt, breath—teaching the reader by line 6 and paying off in the final drop. No mixed metaphors: mirror-to-breath-to-nothing follows coherent liquefaction. Information density strong: “twenty-seven paper lungs collapsed around verbs too sharp to inhale” performs three jobs. Minor scaffold: “healed in moonlight” repeats three times; however, it functions as refrain, not loop, and powers closure, so only a light tap.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences unpack translator guilt, birthday massacre, reef ecology. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (shelling→distant→aid convoy). Rhythm breathes—long cadence for twilight build-up, staccato for letter-by-letter decryption. Minor overwrought cluster: “chromatic fish; now it hosted my sleeplessness” could prune one modifier, but figurative logic stays coherent. Closure line “quiet percussion of peace still possible” lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Syntactic variety mirrors glaze layers—long aqueous sentences alternate with fragment beats; no loops; “pewter quilt,” “prismatic laughter,” “fermented stars” are precise, never mixed; high density—each sentence layers light, memory, or cost; closure line is clean, propelling outward.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm accelerates with fold-sequence; sentence variety supports breath. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—firefly pigment, silver ribbon—no mixed metaphors. Zero scaffold loops; no filter-verb stacks. Information density high: single sentences deliver setting, tool, emotional tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: sentences carry metaphoric payload and causal push ("moonlit soil" doubles as burial site and surveillance timer). Mixed-metaphor risk ("converging chaos pressurized inside a jar") but jar image recurs in closure warp, earning its keep. No paraphrase loops; each orchid detail introduces new code syllable. Rhythm accelerates with alley sprint, mirroring ticking satellite clock.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Syntactic variety ripples: spiral sentences mirror staircase ascent, then fragment into petal drifts. Every clause advances image or pressure; no scaffold. Figurative density is high but patterned—shell, pearl, throat, reef—so vehicles cohere without collision. A single paraphrase echo (“shyly unstoppable”) is the lone micro-loop, too minor to dull the final chord.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences carry triple duty—advance story, deepen atmosphere, and echo sound physics—without scaffold. Figurative layering is patterned early (pearl echo, silk wisps) so the lushness feels taught, not sprayed. No mixed metaphors; vehicles respect physical logic. One paraphrase loop (“bulbs guttered… bulbs darkened”) but it occurs in low-pressure exposition; closure beat is clean. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: clauses lengthen as Lira thins, then snap to a single note.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Figurative language is dense but patterned, never muddled; mixed-metaphor guardrails passed. Rhythm modulates with scene breath, no template cadence detected. Minor paraphrase loop “promise…promise” is purposeful, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with varied sentence cadence; metaphor strings serve pattern rather than clutter; minor overwriting in “mountain sighed… tuning fork” line but no loops or scaffold; closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Varied sentence openings avoid algorithmic drum; high information density—“sun slicing in, then fading, like hope on a timer” does three jobs. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“gum arabic”) is POV-justified by bookshop attic. Momentum breathes with attic nights montage without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings seldom repeat. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“she felt the city inhale through her own lungs; rusted girders groaned”). Metaphors stay coherent within aquatic/celestial field. One scaffold paraphrase (“the drowned kept their own time…made her instruments stutter”) could compress; else clean.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric density is high but patterned early (“transliterate emotions into color”), so figurative profusion reads as taught rule, not clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or motion. Rhythm modulates: fragment “This seed did not bloom; it sank” snaps the spiral turn. Closure line “invisible lullabies” lands clean, no mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the stunt sequence without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “soapy water sheeted…making the arcade seem suddenly afloat” maintains coherent vehicle. One minor loop: “stars jittered…stars…stellar spill” thrice inside 150 words, but the reprise charges the final image, so the repetition reads purposeful rather than artifactual.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from liquid long coils to fragmentary gasps, accelerating with the dance; no template cadence. Figurative layering is dense but each metaphor (dust as syllables, tide as grammar) advances the central conceit without contradiction. One mixed vehicle: “teeth of absence” beside “obsidian grace” is allowed because both serve the body-as-texture rule. Zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from languid dawn observation to kinetic arc of prism; no template cadence. High density: “violet thread of sky,” “latent auroral residue” each do image + atmosphere + stakes work. One mixed-metaphor risk—“ribbons of silver fire spelling out debts”—but physical logic holds (ribbons = aurora, debts = ledger). Closure image remains lucid; artifact does not touch final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. High density—“moonlight slipping through its fracture like a thin blade of mercy” does three jobs: light, violence, mercy. Sentence variety supports breath: long anaphoric line on “tasting” followed by staccato questions. Opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Proofing clean; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or idea. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—balloon, tide, spiral—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “polished smooth by the next wave, the next dream, the next trial balloon” is intentional cadence, not artifact. Opening and closing lines are sculpted, recharging motif.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers job-tool-heritage. Figurative logic (camera-building) stays coherent; no mixed metaphors. Minor template cadence in “legacy’s burden” refrain costs −0.2, but it never touches the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors heartbeat-to-echo transition, earning high band.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensorium, world-rule, and emotional charge without redundancy. Figurative control: metaphors (living chandeliers, jury of mirrors) extend coherent visual field. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges prism/rain motif. Micro-movements (“she hummed… louder, weaving new lines”) advance plot, not puppetry. Register stable within lyric fabulism; no thesaurus churn.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: each sentence layers ritual, sensory, and emotional work without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned (starlight, vein, cradle) and avoids density penalty. Minor loop risk in “every scream, every surrender, every silent death” is offset by cumulative litany effect, so artifacts do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density high: single sentences twin sensory and moral registers—“crunch echoed like distant thunder during the lull.” Mixed metaphors avoided; lattice, map, constellation share fracture DNA. Rhythm breathes with pressure—fragments before sparks, longer clauses before storm break. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or charge. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) justified by climactic abstraction moment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses metaphor, action, and world rule—“snow melted into spring water that reflected starlight like shattered mirrors.” No loops or scaffold; figurative layer is dense yet patterned, taught early (“statues wearing frost like lace veils”) and paid off in cereus bloom. One near-muddle: “arterial red” as color of alarming serenity momentarily clashes with lavender, but the clash is intentional, not clarity break.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors ink strokes—long flowing clauses interrupted by abrupt burns (“the stick burned down to his fingers”)—propelling without scaffold. Figurative density is high but purposeful: every metaphor (smoke marionettes, stardust skin) re-enters the ash-ink closure, avoiding decorative waste. One paraphrase loop (“reversed his reversal”) is allowed as intentional mirror. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; clarity intact even at lyric pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences perform double duty: “I spread the card on the packed snow like a map of negative stars” advances action while layering metaphor. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language is patterned (ice, breath, music) and pays off in closure. Minor overwrought phrase (“snowmelt ardor”) is the single hairline slip preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often couples sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“water and light pour in, carrying seeds that sprout before they land”). Figurative layering is dense but coherent—storm dreaming, paper-bird map—without mixed-metaphor violations. Minor template cadence in tripled descriptors (“crystal and rust,” “moss and rumor”) but rhythm serves incantatory tone and never obscures causality. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—dust like pale constellations—and never muddies causality. Information density high: one line often advances atmosphere and motive simultaneously. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence lengths create tidal rhythm that breathes with the sanctuary. Metaphors are coherent—glass melting does not contradict later lake imagery because both serve liquefaction motif. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal grain. Information density is high—”carbon that once formed wheat fields and children’s drawings” compresses cosmology into eight words without crowding.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught (glass, frost, mirror) and pays off in sapling image. No mixed metaphors; “aurora folded into her chest like silk collapsing into a needle’s eye” is precise. Information density high; every line advances breath, blood, or boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences do setting, metaphor, and interiority (“Sunlight poured through the absent rose window, striping aisles of air and bark”). Figurative layering is patterned, not decorative—deciduous vows reappear in scrolls, sap, scent. Zero paraphrase loops; each mention of ribbon adds physical change (bow catches moonlight → satin shredded by pollen → fibers absorbed). Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase—docked −0.2, still within POV stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence layers image and motion (“her gloved fingers brushing starlight-laden petals that chimed like tuning forks”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last without contradiction. Filter verbs are absent; perception is immediate. A single mixed image—“stomachache of revelation”—is forgivable gustatory wordplay that fits the nausea motif. Final third is artifact-free, allowing the closing cadence to ascend without clutter.</question>

    <comment>The nonlinear-inheritance orchard is not a gimmick but a lived emotional system: every blossom is an unlived memory, every flush of the toilet a forgone kindness. Familiar tropes (forbidden knowledge, memory-erasing fruit) are inverted so that the price of future wisdom is literal loss of past love. Risky structural recursion—story as footnote to itself—pays off when the reader realizes the “gentle warning” is printed in the same starlight they just read. Specificity of science-fantasy botany (xylem-linked plumbing, galaxy-fruit with black-hole seeds) makes the concept inseparable from this asteroid alone.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density—each sentence performs dual duty: “folding empty spaces between pages” advances action while prefiguring theme. Metaphors are coherent (library as clef, mountain as staff) and internally consistent. Minor scaffold: “Rescue missions, she reminded herself…” is self-expository; could lose the clause without loss. No loops or synonym churn; cadence varies. Filter verbs nearly absent; strong verb preference (“she pronounced it, feeling the sound remove…”) keeps immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without purple overload. No loops or synonym churn; each lily, shard, and syllable is distinct. Mixed metaphors are functional (bay-as-book, comma-ship) because the textural lens licenses them. One hairline slip: “unkindled solace” is repeated verbatim; still, the phrase accrues new weight each time.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is disciplined: “oxidized time” flakes are literal rust on gears. Opening line anchors voice and anomaly in one stroke. Final line “status: circulating” uses archival diction to re-open the story, a clean cadence snap. No register drift, no filter-verb stacks; high information density with read-aloud rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She lifted a shard of ice newly formed, tilting it toward a gently luminous lichen lantern, and began the augury” advances action, setting, and stakes. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to staccato peril without drumbeat monotony. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “bloom of hush” is singular controlling image. One scaffold trace: “footsteps, soft as hammered repose” is immediately repeated in the climax; because the phrase is motif-central, the echo reads intentional rather than loop artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from wound-cord clauses to fragment sparks; rhythm accelerates up spiral stairs, then hushes in desert mute. Figurative density is high but patterned—light, fracture, refraction—never muddled; mixed metaphors absent. One scaffold trace: “rose glow” appears twice in closing paragraph; minor loop does not dull the final image. Line-level propulsion flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new sensory or causal data. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Figurative control: “shadows crawled like black ivy” sustains botanic logic; no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety mirrors pressure—long, humid clauses contract into staccato pellets clattering. Final line “the city began to speak itself anew” releases rhythm after cumulative tension without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythmic control mirrors ascent—short clangorous sentences at moat, elongated clauses up the spiral, staccato crackle at ignition. Mixed metaphors avoided; “corked heavens” and “glass heart” stay coherent within fireworks lexis. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional stakes, and causal push. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; “stone petals” and “blooming fortress” recur with purpose, not filler. Copy-clean; punctuation exact.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—advance image, embody emotion, foreshadow release (“pressed the doll’s lips to the root, transferring the hush”). Mixed-metaphor risk is avoided; vehicles stay within the garden-inversion logic. Rhythm modulates from long honeyed clauses to the staccato of “She opened the doll’s cracked skull.” Only a single paraphrase loop (“tasting of the silence that follows a last breath” echoed two sentences later) prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful; each metaphor (wind as seamstress, sky exhaling) advances atmosphere without crowding. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Sentence variety strong; openings avoid monotony. Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Information dense: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and world data. Final line cadence resolves with silver note—read-aloud ear test passes. Minor risk: occasional adjective richness (“fractured yet luminous”) but serves POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive—each sentence layers sensory or historical data without scaffold. Metaphors are purposeful (paint like old skin, ruby like frozen blood) and non-contradictory; no loops or synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line resolves by image. One minor over-adornment—“impossible colors” repeated twice—stops this just short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density: “iron weight through thin fabric” does atmosphere + stakes + body in five words. Occasional metaphor stack (“loaded emptiness of someone who had forgotten how to breathe”) risks purple, but pattern is taught and echoed, so tolerated. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates into final dissolution. Pronouns stable, tense clean.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near immaculate: zero loops, mixed sentence lengths, high-density metaphor that never muddies causality. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One hairline slip—"like neon scripture" edges toward purple, but the bioluminescent context justifies luminescent theology. Otherwise, nouns sharp, verbs strong, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Metaphors are dense but patterned—every image is sonic or archival—so density feels intentional rather than purple. One template cadence appears: “each rotation a generation, each click a crown…” yet it serves as rhythmic gear-turning and is paid off. No synonym loops; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “bloodied page like a lantern” compresses symbol, light, and public signal). Closure line is crisp: “door stood open, handle gone,” giving the ear a metronomic stop.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence does two jobs—image plus emotional reweighting. Metaphors are coherent within the alchemical logic; no mixed vehicles violate the world’s physics. Rhythm modulates from long liquid clauses to staccato “step, pause, pirouette,” matching the choreography. Only a single paraphrase loop—“shivering bliss” repeated near opening and close—dulls the ear by a hair, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is virtuosic: no scaffold, no loop, every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—mixed metaphors are avoided even when stacking acoustic, textile, and animal vehicles. Rhythm modulates from legato dawn phrases to the staccato of shard-chimes without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences often fuse sensory, emotional, and world data—“moonstone cabochon dust speck, the last fragment of the great lens.” No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay arboreal/optical. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she half-remembered”). Minor paraphrase loop in “leaves now rose in spirals, their runes rearranging into new sentences” could trim, but artifact never touches closure. Final line recharges “mossy delight” without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphors are internally coherent (leaf spiral = compass rose) and never mixed. Density is high—“green snow,” “ladder of mercury”—yet each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No synonym loops; sentences vary length naturally. One near-scaffold: “without the certainty it replaced” echoes prior clause, but the echo is thematic, not mechanical. Read-aloud rhythm is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence carries dual cargo (image + causal nudge). Metaphors are internally consistent—silver gutters, mercury syllables, gold seam—all obey foundry physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“teach the others how to carry luminous regret”) resolves by action that recharges the motif. No register drift, no filter-verb stacks; high information density without purple inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information-dense lines perform triple duty: “pewter mask strap bit into the soft flesh behind my ears” locates object, sensory pain, and time stamp in eight words. Figurative language is patterned—UV communion, polygraph leaves—so density never collapses into purple. One paraphrase loop detected (“every footfall a datum, every stumble an outlier”) but the anaphoric pulse serves the rosary cadence, not scaffold. Closure image remains crystal: cooling trash = miracle, no metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“market swayed like a lantern”—and never clogs the high-pressure crossing. One mixed metaphor (“anchor set in reverse”) is minor enough to keep this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is mostly impeccable; information density high—“snowfall of ticket stubs dated 1987, each stamped ADMIT ONE TO THE SKY, their edges curled like dead magicians’ ribbons” does three jobs in one breath. One mixed metaphor cluster: “coiled heart intact, ticking so softly only the dead could hear” bundles mechanical and cardiac images without contradiction but edges toward purple. No loops or scaffold; pronoun tracking clean; final sentence cadence earns its sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image + action (“pulling cloth across silvered glass while humming…”). Mixed metaphors are avoided; “ribbons of chronology twisted like silk scarves soaked in blood” sustains coherent vehicle. One minor scaffold: “the air grew warmer, as though sorrow itself were being tucked into bed” slightly abstracts the prior warmth cue, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: every sentence moves image, sound, or stakes; no filler transitions. Metaphors are coherent—rust as covenant, diamond of night—without mixed logic. Rhythm modulates with tension: long clauses for descent, staccato chimes for dawn. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; opening and closing lines are sharply anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density, zero scaffold loops, metaphors physically coherent (“silence thick as felt”). One hairline slip—“hinged awakenings” is used twice within three lines—creates micro-echo, not closure blur. Final paragraph varies cadence to breath-like lift, recharging motifs without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors are physically coherent: “basalt throat,” “gears of salt and starlight.” Density high—one line can do scent, history, and moral weight. Register stays within sculptor’s lexicon; no thesaurus drift. Closure line “just horizon, just wood, just the next breath of wind” is spare yet charged, re-pruning prior ornament without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Figurative density is high but patterned early (glass, hush, bloom) so payoff justifies the risk. No mixed metaphors; each image extends the cathedral/light logic. Occasional lyric overlap (“quilt of white,” “faintest perfume”) but spaced enough to avoid loop. Final painted panes sentence propels outward without clutter. Read-aloud rhythm intact; paragraph cuts land on image-turns that re-charge stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Every sentence carries dual cargo: “sand closed over my ankles like shackles” both embodies and foreshadows. Zero paraphrase loops; information is dense yet breatheable. Metaphors stay physically coherent—ink petals, glass-grain—never mixing domains. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the same combustible ink motif with flawless sonic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Metaphors are deliberate but kept sparse; when stacked (“wire ribs like whale bones”) they serve spatial grounding, not ornament. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either ritual step or conceptual premise. Opening line anchors voice and surreal stakes instantly. Minor scaffold: two successive “I would” constructions in ritual declaration could vary, but the cadence reads as litany rather than monotony and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled—long breathless sentences mirror vortex suction, then shorten at the crack. No synonym loops; “furiously tranquil” returns twice, each time reweighted. Mixed metaphors are scarce; one strained “lullaby shouted across a storm” is voice-motivated and legible. Closing line achieves Charged Poise without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances log, atmosphere, or stakes. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory: “clouds surged like slow whales,” “warm stones dropped into cold milk.” Information density high—barometer readings, splice mechanics, civic timer—all braided through action. Rhythm modulates from hush to toll without monotony; final line lingers like after-ring.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable; no synonym loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors are intentional (“black water” folding station) and paid off by closure image. Information load is high yet propulsive: each sentence layers grief, tool, sky. One clause—“primal elegance of shared orbit”—approaches loftiness but is anchored by tactile context, so register drift is minimal and momentary.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Density is high: single sentences fuse image, stakes, sensory data without scaffolding. Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses swell, then snap to short final line. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (ash spirals ≈ missing bees, covenant ≈ comb). Hairline deduction: “weight equal to the desert’s heat pressing against his ribs” is slightly mixed (weight/pressure) but does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent and sale bustle; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—time as dust, currency as story—without mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“price tags… descriptions” twice in 40 words) docks 0.2. Otherwise lean, information-dense, and read-aloud clean.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—“torn net that still holds fish” returns as literal net of almosts carried home. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay coherent (spiral, doorway, chord). Information density high: “clam shell gnawed into crescent moon” does characterization, setting, and metaphor in five words. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances molecule, myth, or motion. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “chord struck on a cello made of bone” is the single metaphor, earned by the tower’s resonance. High information density: one line can span geological time, Guild politics, and personal exile without stalling. No register drift; technical lexicon (cyanotype, isotope) stays inside Mara’s cognition. Final clause—“she walked on”—is a blade of momentum that cuts sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “wheels grinding coral dust that had once been alive” does world, history, and sensory work in one clause. Figurative coherence remains intact—metal flowers shaped as outstretched hands extend the treaty metaphor without violating physical logic. Minor scaffold: two “then” transitions and one “until” could be cut, but artifacts never approach the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm varies sentence length and opening, culminating in the monosyllabic release: “He whispered a single word… ‘begin.’”

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances scent, image, or choice. Figurative density serves pattern: copper/iron/blood color-rhyme is taught early and paid off when sunrise-blood becomes orchard-smoke. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay metallic or vegetal. Filter-verb count is minimal—smells translate directly to syntax without “she could smell.” Final line earns its paradoxical quiet through cumulative sensory reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is dense (“corridor folded like paper”) but purposeful, taught early and paid off. One mixed metaphor risk: “compass rose blazed like a miniature sun” is forgivable in climax. Minor filter verb slips (“felt the station hum”) do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph shapes mirror descent/ascent pacing. Figurative density is high but patterned (ice, sky, chess metaphors interweave) and paid off at closure. No mixed metaphors; “laugh that sounded like breaking seals” is precise. Minor scaffold: repeated “she” openers in descent streak could prickle, but compression serves momentum. Information density strong—every sentence advances image, rule, or choice. Typos absent; grammar clean.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—"She unbound the lace from her left boot, tied it around the white queen’s neck like a tiny noose, and set the piece on the farthest square" advances action, symbol, and stakes. Rhythm accelerates into the final overlapping footsteps, then releases with the quiet "did not look back." No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; figurative language is selective, never more than one image per high-pressure sentence. Copy clean: no tense drift, no pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence can world-build, escalate, embody emotion—“Custodian lunged, but hidden thunder finally broke; lightning, long hoarded between pages, struck the shelves.” Metaphors are coherent: mercury-glass skin mirrors both prophecy and prison; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “seed them anew / reburied her gifts” inside the same beat docks 0.2. Final line cadence resets, releasing tension cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or board state. Metaphors (felt-like hush, stormlight corridors) are coherent and non-contradictory. Information density is high—e.g., “algebraic chess coordinates mixed with village names” does double descriptive and plot work. One near-purple phrase—“winnowing that separated useful remorse from paralyzing shame”—is earned by context and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm drives escalation: long breathy sentences for climb, staccato fragments for echo ricochet. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—mirror as prism, spire as phononic bone. Information is dense: “seven pale ribbons that painted the opposite tower with ghost sentences” does visual, sonic, and thematic work in one stroke. Closure beat is uncluttered: “a single white feather that floated into her hand, weightless yet sufficient.”

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. One mixed-metaphor risk—“tectonic teeth grinding”—is brief and does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence music is deliberate; parallel anaphora (“the track a scar… asphalt gave way…”) mirrors descent. Metaphors stay physically coherent: porcelain bells → fragile cargo → shell. No synonym loops; each adjective earns keep (“diesel and wet rope” precisely nails harbor perfume). One mixed moment—“intimately aloof” repeats without rephrasing—stubs perfect flow yet occurs early enough to avoid closure contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Metaphors are dense but internally coherent—glass, scent, vibration logic stays consistent. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and syntax. One mixed vehicle (“screaming tenderness”) is forgiven at climax because it is the core tonal coin.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    High figurative density risks purple overload, but each metaphor is purpose-driven: “moonlight…a fraction each night, the way sorrow shifts” reweights later dish tilt. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed vehicle—“voice like rusted water”—reads intentionally, not slip.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally: long sensorial sentences alternate with fragment commands (“Don’t.”). Figurative density is high but patterned—storm-green, noose-roots, luminous children—each reappears to charge closure, avoiding decorative overload. No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or choice. Minor simultaneity slip in “film crept…wrapped…revealing” stacked in one line costs −0.1, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences advance atmosphere, stakes, and sensory layering simultaneously. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than restates (“petals like borrowed memories… petals loosening into tiny rafts”). One mixed vehicle: “fog hums in a bell” stretches auditory metaphor, but the pattern is taught early and recurs without clutter. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs dominate (“slapped,” “pinned,” “swept”). Clean grammar and tense stability throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence variety and sensory density are strong; only minor scaffold: “the same…as his father” stem repeated twice. One paraphrase loop: “the same shifting symbol as the matrix chip” echoes twice within three lines. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the descent. Clean enough to keep immersion, but the micro-repetition prevents 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density yet lean: one sentence often delivers image + causality + emotional valence (“She pressed forward, driven by the need to unravel…”). Figurative layer is patterned early (“bleeding starlight”) and therefore paid off, avoiding purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm mirrors oxygen debt—sentence length contracts as air thins, a physiological metronome.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long accumulative sentences build density, then fracture at climax. Information density high—“compressed light without context, heat without hearth” does triple lexical, emotional, thematic work. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances choice or image. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent: volcanic glass sings, light becomes ribbon, spiral equals return path—no mixed logic.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates with pressure—“Snowflakes landed like white ink, dissolving…”—then breathes into longer cadence for the final monument. Figurative language is patterned (fire, ink, snow as erasable text) rather than ornamental clutter; every metaphor does double duty for theme and setting. Zero paraphrase loops; “scroll” never becomes “document” or “parchment.” Clean grammar and tense throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors lung constriction—long clauses tightening, then fracture into motes. Figurative language is selective; no metaphor contradicts the physics of the scene. A single scaffold loop (“three inches above… three inches higher”) is thematic echo, not clutter, and pays off in closure. No artifact touches the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—cyclone of staves returns in final line as “echo.” One near-mix: “induced currents…singing a microtonal lament” momentarily personifies wiring, but within musician POV. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; clauses track causally under time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to staccato fragments (“leaning became tipping…”) under escalating pressure; figurative density is high but patterned, not gratuitous. No loops or mixed metaphors; information density remains triple-duty—advancing image, theme, and kinetics simultaneously—so the lyric overwrite never obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“razor edges,” “frozen lightning”) and paid off at closure. No mixed vehicles or synonym loops; “fjord quiet” returns with reweighted hush. One template cadence in “Through counting backwards…”重复使用 but serves incantatory build. Final paragraph breathes without drumbeat; information density remains high—each sentence either re-images or re-prices time.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “spores swarmed his outline like fireflies copying a shape they admired” paints both Luc and farm ethic. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the bioluminescent field. Scaffolding excised; no paraphrase restatements. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases into bird-song light, satisfying read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Compressed density: single sentences do double duty (“scent that clung to Mira’s clothes” = setting + emotional residue). Varied rhythm, no template cadence; metaphors stay concrete (“fracturing it into a spectrum”). Minor scaffold: three sentence stems beginning “She… rode… returned…” create intentional pulse rather than monotone. No mixed metaphors; closure image crisp. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image, emotion, and metaphor without scaffold. No paraphrase loops; repeated motifs (loop, disc, hum) accrue new meaning rather than stall. Figurative language is internally coherent—glass, rust, tide, ink form a metallic-aqueous palette. One hairline slip: “like damp ivy” is adjacent to “like tide,” creating momentary mixed aqueous metaphor, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: single sentences couple sensory, emotional, and thematic work (“ink blooming like bruised violets across the parchment”). No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are surgical. Mixed metaphor risk—“laughter braided into ribbon”—reads purposeful under lyric license. Final line stumbles slightly with “notes stumbling then catching, like gulls learning wind,” a comparison that feels stretched.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm modulates from staccato joke beats to longer leaf-wave cadence, mirroring communal inhalation. Sentences perform double duty: "dented ration tins into a chessboard" sets scene and character profession. No scaffold loops; each mention of ivy, moon, or joke accretes new data. Figurative language stays coherent—metaphor vehicles don’t collide—and the final mirrored canopy pays off clock and seed imagery without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    High figurative density is justified by accumulative design; metaphors stay coherent within sonic/cartographic logic. No mixed vehicles; “grammar of sorrow and wonder braided” is abstract but earned by prior sensory braiding. Rhythm accelerates into spiral, exhales at stillpoint—sentence variety supports. Minor filter-verb cluster (“he knew… he understood”) at climax dulls immediacy; keeps score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense lines (“effect arrived before cause, meaning experience itself arrived pre-threshed”) do triple duty (world rule + emotional state + stakes). Metaphors are coherent—garden, tree, filament, lullaby—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long hypnotic sentences mirror anomaly drag, then short landing clause “She landed softly.” Minor scaffold: two “she felt” filters, but both serve gravitational embodiment. Closure sentence is clean, tactile, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is thickly figurative yet each metaphor performs double duty: “moonlight painted silver ladders” maps both visual lattice and the climb toward unheard music. No synonym loops; sentences vary in length and launch angle, accelerating toward the chord-release, then lengthening into decay. One strained figure—“luminous ladders”—is forgiven for its tactile payoff. The closing cadence mirrors musical diminuendo, earning the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate across participial, prepositional, clausal. Information density high—each sentence advances map, memory, or metaphor. Minor scaffold: “volcanic tenderness” appears thrice with diminishing returns; “burning artistic creations” vs “artistic trail” is near-paraphrase. Metaphors stay coherent (fire = knowledge), but one mixed moment—“eyes that now seemed to follow her through the darkness”—leans cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between staccato drum fragments and legato lagoon lines, sustaining momentum. Metaphors stay internally coherent—sound garden acoustics never contradict water-as-emulsion logic. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new acoustic or bodily information. High density: “seedpods became hush-muted cymbals” does world, sensory, and metaphor work simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density, with almost zero scaffold; each sentence advances map, sound, or aurora. Metaphors are spare and mechanical, fitting port ethos. One paraphrase loop (“whisper network…whispered softly”) is minor. Opening and closing images (hand-drawn folds / harmonic chamber) echo without intrusive symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with tide-level cadence; sentence length varies to let light ‘drip’ or ‘sketch helix.’ Figurative density is high yet coherent—vehicles nest rather than collide. One paraphrase loop detected (“darkness…darkness”) but it serves incantatory payoff, not sloth. No mixed metaphors in peak beat where mirror folds starlight onto water.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with stealth: long sentences for misty approach, staccato for window hops. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“library breathed,” “shelves creaking like rooks”—each extends the chess conceit. No scaffold loops; every line advances image or stakes. Only one paraphrase flutter: “the town itself were leaning in to listen” re-states the mist’s sharp edge.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do triple duty—image, motion, thematic reverb—without paraphrase loops. Only one mixed metaphor risks overgrowth: “island trying to leave her” personifies land yet the image pays off when the ground literally dissolves. No scaffold clogs the final third; the release of the scrimshaw lands clean, so 9-band is reachable despite hairline figurative density earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: every sentence advances image or stakes; no loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (turbine as choreographer, guilt as splinter); minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” fits POV’s bureaucratic residue; final line tightens cadence, no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates with ice phase: long voweled clauses for melting, staccato for crack-threat. Figurative density peaks at closure but stays coherent—vehicles of sound, light, parentheses interlock. One scaffold trace: repeated “tremor of certainty” could trim a use; does not touch closure. Otherwise zero loops, high information per sentence, no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “warpta silver curl that sang when the wind passed through it” does triple sensory job. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—glass dust as colored rain—without mixed-logic violations. Final-line cadence reprises “broken things sing louder” with ear-tested echo, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric song sentence balanced by terse “They moved like ghosts.” Information density high; most lines serve twin duty (atmosphere + causality). Minor loop: “artificial pilgrimage” repeated four times without new inflection; not at closure. Metaphor stack in golden-shadow sequences risks purple but stays within POV’s sensory bias. No scaffold, no synonym churn; pronouns clean.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies through enjambed clauses and single-word beats. Information density high: each sentence advances placement or symbolism. One paraphrase loop (“coordinates…coordinates inside”) and one template cadence (“She placed… She placed…”) but both serve liturgical pulse. No mixed metaphors; dissolution image stays physically coherent. Artifacts do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—tarot as circuit diagram, footprints as data points. One paraphrase loop (“multiply paths” repeated twice in closing paragraph) nicks perfection. Otherwise zero loops, no mixed vehicles, strong verbs throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, no scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“folding hope and regret together like wings”—is permissible at the emotional crest. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve momentum. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif. Register stays within Mira’s scholar-poet lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers job—action, atmosphere, metaphor, emotion—without Scaffold. Figurative language patterned and paid off: “thin ice beneath her boots” foreshadows actual cracking of creed. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physically coherent. Minor template cadence in “she would…” conditional trio but serves ritual rhythm, forgiven at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between flowing anaphora and clipped beats, propelling the accumulative design. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (storm as applause, pigeons as sprocket holes) feeds the film motif. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. One near-scaffold: “dust floated like slow film frames” and “storm without rain, like applause…” back-to-back, but the second reframes stakes, so minor.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: each sentence either advances dismantling, deepens sensory texture, or reweights the cosmic stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (meteor = Braille, aurora = ink) and never muddles causality. Zero loops or scaffold; no register drift. Final line cadence mirrors opening hush, creating circular propulsion without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies from oceanic roll to staccato charm; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but every metaphor is tied to guard’s world—film, rail, divergent archive—so passes density test. One mixed metaphor: “gears kissing the sand” momentarily violates physical logic, minor. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; information density high—each sentence advances image, stakes, or time-sense.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Information-dense yet musical; most lines perform at least two jobs (e.g., “humid dawn” imprints both time and texture). Figurative runs are patterned, not cluttered; vehicles stay coherent (gear = sparrow = flake). One scaffold loop—“the sound of wind through different trees” repeated four times—dulls micro-momentum; still short of artifact penalty because it teaches chorus-effect. Final image avoids mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work without scaffolding. Metaphors (“snowflake more added to the drift”) stay internally coherent; no synonym loops. Clause variation supports breathless ascent and final frozen poise; minor elevated register fits the choir-ghost ambience.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence does double duty (“galvanized dust motes rose like liberated subjects”). Metaphors are coherent: ink as constellation, glamour as brocade, collapse as graceful. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“threading,” “quivered,” “unraveling”). Final line anchors the motif: “every throne is only ink yet to fade” recharges earlier pellet and marginalia, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence variety strong—no template cadence; opening noun-phrase opener (“The sea level monitoring station…”) and later verb-fronted fragments (“Down through the thermocline…”) modulate tempo. Mixed metaphors rare; “white mantis above the lagoon” sharp, not repeated to death. One scaffold trace: “a practice of tapping rhythms on surfaces” is cycled verbatim three times—economical for motif but edges toward loop; does not touch closure beat. Information density high—each sentence advances image or plot; pronoun references clean; no homophone slips. Paragraph cuts purposeful; none removable without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm modulates with tension—long hypnotic sentences for hum-crescendo, staccato clauses for sparks. Metaphors are audacious yet coherent within the poetic register. One mixed image: “blue soup” momentarily clashes with cathedral tone but recovers. No scaffold loops; information density is high. All sentences advance image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is dense and propulsive: “words aligned into coordinates” performs double duty—advances decoding and mirrors chlorophyll alignment. Only micro-slip: “implanted destiny—do not trust the council’s breeders” edges toward prompt-echo; however, it is embedded in contraband letter, so registers as artifact not loop. No mixed metaphors, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges motif of rustling pride.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence openings vary from participial to noun-driven to fragment (“Tomorrow the resin will set…”) without algorithmic pattern. Metaphors are bone-clean: drone as “distant heron,” blast as “red chrysanthemum”—each single, coherent vehicle. No scaffold loops; every clause advances either sensory anchor or interior shift. Final line ends on monosyllabic cadence—“arithmetic of continuation”—that lands like a pulse restart, ear-tested and echo-free.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences multi-task: “salt-stained ledgers toppled around him” sets smell, sight, stakes. Metaphors are internally coherent (lunar wax → tower collapse). Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“grammar of seeing,” “confetti archetypes”) risks mild register drift but stays justified by artist POV. No loops, no scaffold; information-dense. Closing “luminescent ache” is first use of the exact prompt phrase, avoiding premature artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies from short tracker beats to lyrical elongation at the portal moment. Figurative language is dense but patterned—ink, wind, time—so density penalty waived. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. One mixed metaphor (“time folded like origami” beside “drowning in consciousness”) blurs physical logic, −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action: short sentences under crawl-shaft pressure, longer coils during reflection. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds temperature or spatial data. Metaphors (“live coal,” “distant applause”) are sparse, precise, and physically coherent. Zero typos or tense drift; punctuation clean even through experimental en-dashes and fragmented breaths.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences perform double duty (e.g., “canvas fragment… resembled the lines etched into her mother’s weathered hands” marries object, backstory, and emotional lineage). Metaphors stay physically coherent—canvas weave transfers to stem pattern. Final line couples sound and image without overwriting. High information density maintained; minor register elevation (“senselessly perceptive”) is earned by voice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image and concept—“constellations lumber earthward like sleepwalkers tangled in their own glittering nets.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative logic stays coherent. Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to the clipped “Stay.” Minor overwriting in star-goddess paragraph (−0.2) keeps it sub-9, but no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “headlines glowing brighter as it neared perihelion” fuses physics and metaphor without crowding. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances orbit or character. figurative muddle zero—vehicles stay consistent (orbit, planet, cometary debris). One near-purple phrase—“solemn playroom for absent gods”—earns its keep by thematic payoff when gods are proven absent. Rhythm accelerates across the crack, then exhales on “quiet sentence,” a cadence shift that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative clauses mimic inhalation, then short verbs mirror scatter. Metaphors stay coherent—mist as watercolor, hush as congregation—and serve action, not ornament. One paraphrase loop (“meaning felt like chalk dust… present but unformed”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or template cadences obscure closure. Information density high: one sentence can anchor, scent, and foreshadow.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long anaphoric “who…” clauses build incantatory pressure, then fracture into single-clause release at dawn. Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “heat had fractured the star-pattern into something that resembled outstretched arms” simultaneously describes object and prefigures final image. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle (glass edge, constellation memory, citizen additions). Metaphors stay coherent (blade efficiency, map of forgetting). Micro-qualm: “knowledge became fuel for survival” edges toward aphorism; replacing “fuel” with “ember” would keep sensory specificity and crest 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear excellent: syntactic variety, no template cadence. Information density high—each sentence layers scent-sound-color. One paraphrase loop: “echoes that were also scents… each echo a thread” could compress. Metaphors are coherent (popcorn/rosin/brocade all theater-specific). No artifact touches closure. Opening line anchors; final line “endless encore beneath his translucent ribs” propels off “ribs” consonance, satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is sparse and scene-driven (“glowing threads,” “willowglass hope”) without metaphor clash. One minor paraphrase loop: “fractally precise” appears three times in close proximity; not severe enough to dull closure. Information density is high—each sentence advances action or light mechanics—and the final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes—“a growing skin of knowledge meant to outlast bone” does triple duty. One mixed metaphor blip: “newborn star” beside “lowing glaciers” is momentarily discordant but recovers. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are crisp. Opening and final lines anchor and release the sonic motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “pillbox clicked against the stolen keycard—both too small to carry the weight of nations, yet they did” does triple duty. Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative layer is selective and paid off (“moon a thin blade,” “dying star flinging its atoms”).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm is deliberate incantation, but occasional adjective stacks (“spindrift serenity that hovered where river met vapor”) flirt with purple. Metaphors stay coherent—ink, parchment, thread, ferry—yet “ticking rain gutters like a metronome” is reused three times with minimal variation. Information density is high; every sentence layers sensory and symbolic work. No loops or scaffold touch the closure beat, but the final hill crest could lose one modifier without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Metaphors are disciplined—no mixed vehicles, no register drift. Rhythm breathes with the thrum: long anaphoric clauses build heat, then single-note sentences cool. Information density is high—“smoke that had not yet flattened” does triple time-work, mood-work, and causality-flag. Only hairline slip: “phototropic to kindness” is abstract label amid otherwise embodied diction, keeping it shy of 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Few scaffolding loops; occasional modifier clusters (“papery petal like a tiny eviction notice”) ride the lyrical wave without muddling causality; high information density—each sentence layers scent, texture, and stakes—propelling to the clink of brass in gutter.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm mirrors tide and wing-beat: cadence swells then subsides, paragraphs shorten as she climbs. Metaphors stay internally coherent—moonlight as ink, shadow as stylus—no mixed vehicles. One template run (“she… she… she…”) is brief enough to read as drumbeat rather than artifact. Information density is high: one sentence often layers world-rule, emotion, and motion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally: cumulative anaphora (“come barefoot, come thunder, come thread”) builds to a drummer’s crescendo without template monotony. Metaphors are coherent—lotus petals as moon-white stone, thread as vein—each re-appears to charge closure. No scaffold loops; every image does double duty (chiming footfall = hesitation made sound). Minor purple moments (“prismatic quiet”) are pattern-taught and payoff-linked, so forgiven. Opening and final lines pass the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Almost every sentence carries dual duty—texture and causality: “generator exhaust braided with moonlight” simultaneously paints air and signals overload. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure; “gritty lullaby that tasted of copper and thunderstorms” keeps sensory hierarchy. Minor overwrought moments (“color of dried blood”) do not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (“She anchored the compass point… like a tiny antenna” reveals tool-use and ritual precision). Metaphors stay coherent: organ notes “slide off curved iron ribs” keeps sound within railway anatomy. Information density high—every line advances scene or atmosphere. No register drift in peak beats; “colorless sky” in final line is spare yet earned.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “method required opposites to touch” carries plot, theme, and character rule in one line. Metaphors are precise—quarry “exhaled,” ribbon “serpentine curl”—and paid off. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Final “red seam” line is propulsive, not decorative. Zero scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence can deliver exile-act, mildew palette, and Ministry denial. No scaffold loops; each metaphor is physically consistent—copper patina = sky color = bureaucratic decay. Sensory verbs are strong: “drumming,” “pulsed,” “imprinted,” avoiding filter-stack. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” in closing line—reads as Mara’s archival precision, not authorial intrusion, and is justified by earlier catalogic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear: varied cadence, no template runs. Information density high—one sentence often does image + memory + causal cue (“glass flake vibrated in her palm, squares shifting like a stop-motion confession”). Metaphors are coherent under photo-emulsion logic; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “keep going” triple reprise is purposeful wind-code, not artifact. Closure beat is crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “dusky harmony,” “exit ramps sometimes braid into on-ramps,” each metaphor internally consistent and scene-advancing. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed image—“fire teaching manners”—but context justifies anthropomorphism. Copy clean; pronouns tracked. High-band control, minor hairline only.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense: “the star’s dimming was not darkness but a doorway” compresses causality, image, and stakes into one clause. Metaphors stay physically coherent—spectral ink as pollen, grief as glass—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold appears in the repeated “shared burdens” echo, but it is thematic glue, not filler, and is reweighted at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with gait: longer clauses on calm root steps, staccato fragments during seed bite. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay vegetal and martial throughout. Information density high—“apples frozen mid-rot bobbed like skulls” does sensory and symbolic work. Only micro-loop: “confession had to be spoken…had to be spoken” is purposeful anaphora, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is dense and musical, rarely looping; only tiny scaffold—“bones that jutted between the apple roots” repeats root/bone pairing. Metaphors stay coherent: candles drowned in wax, snow covering footprints. One simultaneous participle hiccup: “I carried her past skulls wearing root crowns” misattributes skulls as wearers. High information load—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, symbolic—yet clarity holds; momentum breathes at gate exit. Artifact level blocks 9+ but not 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet musical, sentences doing double duty (action + atmosphere). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and precise. The one mixed metaphor—“vacuum it left, a hollowness”—is minor and early. Closure beat stays crystal, allowing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear is excellent: varying sentence lengths, no template cadence, and a strategic breath before the final plank. Information density is high—one sentence often does three jobs (e.g., “She knelt, pressed the seed into a joint where two magnetic rails crossed, and covered it with iron filings that stuck like frost” advances action, setting, and simile). Figurative language is sparse and precise; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “like a slowed heart” and “like frost” are conventional similes, but they occur early before pressure peaks and do not dull the closure image. No loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors tidal surge—long image-laden clauses ebb into terse gear-clicks. Figurative density is high but patterned; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Minor scaffold: “winter-sun serenity” repeated thrice—intentional motif, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences do triple duty: “The cave accepted the words, repeating them back as a choir of faint chimes” advances action, deepens atmosphere, and sonic-cements POV. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (throat-cave, shell-spiral, membrane-wall). High information density without padding—e.g., “abandoned hopes calcified into the cave’s growing skin” compresses geologic time and human loss. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation; no artifact touches closure mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; every sentence advances map, body, or water. “Accordion bellows patched with tape” recurs with accruing function: luggage trolley → sound box → conduit → sacrifice. Metaphors are physically coherent (stream “wearing down shale” matches mica flecks as mirror shards). Rhythm modulates from creaking platform cadences to liquid iambs as she enters the tunnel. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are kinetic (“pried,” “bobbing,” “fractured”). Opening and final lines are ear-perfect bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dense metaphor packed yet pattern-taught: “lies…stretch truth into fiction and back” primes reader. Mixed metaphor check passed—library as organism remains coherent. No synonym loops; sentence openings vary. One paraphrase ripple: “unspoken words” echoed but thematic. Figurative language peaks at closure without muddle. High info density; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor cadence repetition keeps from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: cadence swells like the adagio, then fractures. Metaphors are coherent—velvet dome, bruised purple, frost-seeds—no mixed vehicles. Information density high; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. One micro-loop: “propagate” thrice in two lines, but pattern-teaches urgency. No scaffold, no filter stacks. Closure line is clean, crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence carries image + emotion + mythic referent without clog. No loops or scaffold; figurative chains are coherent—static constellations, cooling maps, lattice of bones extend the same metaphor field. Register never drifts above the character’s arcane craft lexicon. One hairline slip: “radiant hush” is repeated verbatim; still, the reprise feels ceremonial rather than accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with elevation: long clauses ascend, staccato fragments descend. Metaphors are dense (“grape-cooled air,” “fermented forgiveness”) yet mutually coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—one sentence often delivers sensory cue, emotional tilt, and world rule. Minor template cadence in “she… she… she…” openers, but it imitates ritual litany, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from 5-word fragments to 32-word coils; no template cadence. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and textures emotion (“hollow mirror shard…tunnel where reflections went to dissolve”). Only one soft paraphrase loop—“certainty unhooked and flapping like a loose sail”—keeps this from 9+. No artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; figurative language is spare and tethered to physics of water and magnetism. One paraphrase loop (“through the trance… through the patterns”) costs −0.2. Otherwise clean, propulsive, no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm is deliberate incantation; intentional repetition (“pulse left wandering,” “wandering pulse”) accumulates rather than loops—pattern taught and paid off. One visible scaffold: “weathered resolve of his weathered face” could compress to “weathered resolve,” but it is isolated. Metaphors stay consistent—bone as tuning fork, birds as living arrow—no mixed vehicles. Closure image is uncluttered, allowing the bone-dust song to ring.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Figurative language sparse and patterned—barcode snow, printer-toner lilacs—paid off in final unbarcoded flake. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. High information density: “badge…shackle reversed” compresses social forfeiture and symbolic inversion. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Copy clean; pronoun reference clear.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor serves the chromatic obsession. One mixed vehicle: “click that tasted of green” risks synesthetic overload, but it aligns with established synesthesia. No scaffolding or paraphrase loops; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long, breathy accumulations and surgical fragments, mirroring the inhale/exhale of cosmic static. No paraphrase loops; each image adds new sensory angle or conceptual layer. Metaphors stay internally consistent—light fossilizes, coins become teeth, tower becomes chrysalis—forming a coherent physical logic. Minor ly overwriting in the first paragraph (“starlight fossilized into golden panes”) is justified because it establishes the governing metaphor bank.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “Each monster was a sacrifice crystallized” performs thematic and narrative work in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay consistent (starlight as dripping fluid, copper as mirror/ledger). Sentence variety accelerates the observatory awakening then breathes at the paper-souls lift. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” concept is implicit, not labeled—so no drift penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language sparse and precise (“skin stitched from rust and regret”). High information density: one sentence often performs world-building, sensory anchor, and causal seed (“Each flake of rust fell like a scale, and where it landed, a minnow flickered into being”). Sentence variety supports rhythm; no template cadence. Opening and closing lines perform book-end propulsion without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from long breathy accumulations to clipped fragments that match footing on slime. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new physical or emotional information. Figurative language is sparse and precise—"twilight that clung...like damp gauze"—then gets out of the way. The final scatter of “tiny blue flakes” is the only allowed lyric burst, and it pays off the earlier bottle image without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “Flame leapt, obedient yet wild, painting her auburn hair with embered halos” advances action, character, and atmosphere in one sweep. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor chains stay coherent (“liquid iron,” “aerial manuscript”). Minor scaffold: “the same cadence” and “the same minor seventh” echo without new pressure, keeping it just below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences perform double duty: “She unclipped the buckle… considered dropping it as a false clue” advances plot, reveals motive, and textures object in one line. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the aerial vocabulary (spiraling, canopy, cloud-sea) without strain. Rhythm accelerates with shorter fragments at height of confrontation, then exhales into longer cadence after surrender. No scaffolding, no filter-verb stacks; even abstract nouns like “vigil” are anchored to tactile buckle click.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: paragraph lengths breathe from one-line punches to sinuous memory coils. Sentence openings avoid monotony; no template cadence detected. Figurative density spikes only at ritual beats where the pattern justifies it—no clutter in closure beat. One micro-loop: “slicing through pretense” appears twice; the second use is earned callback, not scaffold, so minor.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with storm: long sentences for vegetal surge, staccato for lever throws. Metaphors stay physical—“gears that clicked like anxious teeth”—and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Opening and final lines echo “storm-born silence” to create cadence bookends. One near-artifact: “possibility just born” repeats thrice; minor but keeps refrain from becoming drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances. Rhythmic variation mirrors engine rev:堆积的从句在风道中加速，then cut to a single sob-sentence when the engine dies. Metaphors stay coherent—engine howl = sour orchestra, laughter = rubber ball of light—no mixed vehicles. High information density: “thumb brushing the cracked pull-cord handle that had started a thousand gusty crescendos” does world, backstory, and emotion in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative density is high but patterned: frost as marginalia, moon as illuminated initial; mixed metaphors avoided. One scaffold spot: “interiorizing exteriors” is repeated verbatim; however, the phrase is concept-charged and re-prices at closure, so the loop is functional. Information density strong—single sentences deliver scent, temperature, and metaphysical rule. No artifacts touch the final beat; last line is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density; each sentence layers metaphor, action, consequence. Occasional metaphor stacking—“frozen bloom arrested mid-burst”—but vehicles stay coherent under lyric pressure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final image of copper-drop star is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lines are dense yet propulsive: “gold sublimated into pure photon, a sunrise bottled inside vacuum tubes” does image + consequence in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; figurative language is patterned and paid off. Metaphors remain coherent within the invented physics. Final click is crisp, uncluttered, recharging the groove motif.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: each sentence layers image and stakes (“paintings bled colors into the air that tasted like nostalgia”). No synonym churn; “sinew thread” recurs with accruing charge. Metaphors stay internally coherent (gallery as brain, thread as neuron) without mixed-vehicle clutter. One paraphrase loop (“she understood… she realized”) is minor; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops; “balancedly curious” is repeated deliberately, not churned. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. High information density: “edges become horizons unfolded” does double duty. The final sentence’s “navigable void” crystallizes the closure image without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line craft is dense and propulsive: “vines had learned to mimic heart valves” does double sensory-concept work. Occasional elevated diction (“sodium-orange,” “fibrillation”) fits the clinical tracer POV. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor overwriting in mist-ribbon sentence but it charges the spectral closure image, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphor density is high but coherent—copper veins, auroral scars, crashing hush—all belong to the same electrical-oceanic lexicon. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath; final line hands the reader the copper strand, no explanation. Rhythm modulates with physical space: clipped clauses for crawl, tidal cadence for release, proving syntactic control serves emotional pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “Ink splays into ephemeral patterns: dendrites of regret, axons of almost, synapses of maybe” performs three jobs—neuro metaphor, ghost anatomy, map legend—in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new texture or causality. Metaphors stay coherent within cyber-neural field; only “certificate of continued existence” momentarily abstracts. Final line half-ends on “half” without scaffolding—risky fragmentation that lands because the prior cadence taught clipped closure. Copy-clean; pronouns stable; punctuation deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary from moth-wing fragments to cathedral clauses. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor is single-use yet cumulative—“copper-veined,” “filament throat”—building to the final projection. Information density high; one line fuses anatomy, light, and sound: “veins lit like a filament, projecting texture-sounds.” Only hairline slip: “pottery-rough air” approaches cliché, but saved by tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: each sentence layers metaphor, stakes, and sensory tilt. No paraphrase loops; metaphor chain (flint–bruise–spiral–frost) is patterned, not random. Rhythm breathes with escalation; final line “arrowhead heart ticking like a metronome” propels outward. Minor register lift (“gravitationally playful” twice) but does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Metaphors are dense—almost every sentence—but they form a coherent lyric system rather than purple accretion: glass/water, shell/map, heartbeat/bridge. Zero scaffolding, loops, or synonym churn; no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm mirrors musical phrasing, accelerating at crisis, exhaling at seed release. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” vibe—kept below 9.0 line.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “the sigh of a brass pole warming under a child’s palm” does triple sensory and emotional work. Rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and hammer-short fragments, accelerating through the fragment hover without algorithmic pattern. One coherence slip—“rainwater had collected… forming a shallow pool that mirrored the sky so perfectly he stepped onto the surface expecting to fall upward” risks mixed metaphor (fall upward), but physical logic is instantly restored by next clause. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; figurative language is selective, never stacked in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dense figurative language is patterned, not gratuitous: every metaphor is topological (seashell, Möbius, negative curvature) so vehicles cohere. No mixed metaphors or synonym churn; “tattered silk threads now glowing with the light of ten thousand unwritten novels” is precise culmination, not purple excess. Sentence variety supports momentum: long accumulative clauses build to short crystallizing fragments. Minor scaffold: “she understood” appears twice in closing paragraph—does not obscure cause/effect or dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences perform double duty: “she greeted them and waited” both characterizes and activates the shell-pages. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “lighthouses flickered, rearranged” is precise; no loops, scaffold, or filler stacks; high density with propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic control: clauses swell then collapse into cub-leapt torrent. Metaphors are coherent—ivy keys, ear keyhole, mirror of night—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “improbable longing” echoed thrice; not in closure beat, so −0.2. No filler stacks, no scaffold. High density: each sentence advances image or causality. Final line plants star-lanterns, propulsive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: spondaic crunch of salt crystals, then liquid accordion chords. Metaphors stay coherent—roots as chandeliers, ship ribs as whale bones—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“memories slid back into place”) is forgiven because it serves as cadence release after tension peak.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    High-density lines (“spat into the dust—combative tenderness toward her own fate”) advance three jobs at once. No loops or scaffold; figurative layering is controlled, never more than one image per beat in peak pressure. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for backward walk, staccato for “triangles… circle… refusal.” Minor mixed metaphor alert—“blade smiles when it chooses not to cut”—but it is brief and character-true, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative density is high but patterned and justified by mythic mode; mixed metaphors are avoided. Information density strong—each line advances image or stake. One template-cadence run (“Each dawn he pruned…”) is brief and thematic, not obscuring closure. No loops or scaffold in final third; read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; most sentences carry sensory + causal dual load. One paraphrase loop (“each knot… a knot undone”) mid-story costs −0.2. Figurative layering is high but taught early (“masks hummed”) so does not obscure. Closure image is uncluttered, ensuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from long breathy coils to fragment sparks (“Thunder finally arrived”). Figurative density is high but patterned—every metaphor is electrical or musical, sustaining coherence. No loops or scaffold; each image advances stake or sensation. Occasional elevated diction (“bruised chromas”) is justified by artist-PoV.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sentence-level propulsion is extreme: information triple-loads—“She labeled the reading in her log: ‘Regret, 03:17, altitude 31,000 feet, tastes like burnt coffee and airport goodbyes.’” Metaphors are coherent (gondola as cradle, filament as memory wire) and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “dusty starlight” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, emotional calculus, forward motion. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the sky-coin-memory nexus without contradiction. Rhythm accelerates across paragraph breaks, mirroring countdown. One mixed vehicle—“philosophy and astronomy mixing like slow-motion snow”—is justified by the surreal leaf-fall of books, not a clarity break.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes with scene. Metaphors are coherent—lamps as faltering heart, chalk as syllables—no mixed vehicles. Information-dense: one line can worldbuild, embody emotion, advance plot (“Fuel’s fine... but the light-feed runs on stories”). One minor scaffold: “like an old librarian clearing his throat” is vivid but slightly ornamental; could trim two words.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    High metaphor density but each image is anchored to physical action (frost "racing" along key, door "breathing"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings rotate among prepositional, participial, and direct clauses. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature. One stray mixed metaphor—"thawing steel" hissing—costs a hairline notch. Otherwise compression and momentum remain intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences layer physics (anti-grav seeds), emotion (brambled hope), and motion (ladder sway). Mixed metaphors are intentional—“brambled hope, a clang like berries caught in wire”—and cohere via pain/pleasure fusion. No scaffold loops; paragraph cut test passes. Occasional lyrical stacking (“violet cloud that slowed time for the grieving”) risks purple, but cadence justifies. Final line is clean, propulsive, and typo-free.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or paraphrase; each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors are consistent (metronome clicks, candle-warmth bleed) and physically coherent. High information density: “nut-kernel…oily mash…five warm dots” packs tool, action, and image into one beat. No scaffold; even the frost progression is shown through changing adjectives, not repeated statements.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level propulsion is high: each line layers image, action, and concept—“she uncorked the largest bottle, releasing a beam that stretched across the atrium and refracted through the fruit, projecting fragments of possible prologues”—without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent within the physics of the world (moonlight as ribbon, absence as weight). Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“nucleate,” “ephemeral dedications”) is purposeful, voice-motivated, and taught early, so it never jars.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—“coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes” compresses time, climate, and anatomy in five words. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: droplets “carrying the salt of a hundred forgotten storms” echo later in groundwater feeding hidden gardens. Minor scaffold: “memory of every soul who’d sought refuge here—bitter almonds…copper pennies” lists without new pressure, but cadence serves tasting rhythm. No mixed metaphor or register clash in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences perform double duty (information + image), vary in length, and avoid loops. Metaphors are mixed but deliberately cross-domain (“a bridge is a song you can walk across”) to serve the fusion theme, so no coherence break. Opening and closing lines are propulsive. One paraphrase loop inside “between iron and wood” / “between mechanical and human breath” costs −0.2; otherwise density is high and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “chaotically precise déjà vu” performs its own meaning. One mixed metaphor—“broken periscope mirror abandoned by some giant, long-dead observer”—slightly blurs vehicle, but the image pays off when the mirror dies. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances premise or texture. Final line cadence—“transformation never ceased”—echoes opening helix, closing sonic ring.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with gravity shifts—long sentences float, staccato beats return when time narrows. Figurative layering is dense but patterned (color-as-motion, ink-as-compass) and never muddies causality. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds motion or charge. Minor over-adornment in “terrestrial kiss” but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies: long breathy clauses mirror arboreal time, short pings mimic deer-startle. Figurative language is selective, never clogs high-pressure beats. Zero loops or scaffold; “microscopically” used once, precise. Final line cadence mirrors quiet expectancy. No mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: no looped stems, mixed metaphors, or filler; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority (“the world itself held its breath”). Density is high—information delivered through sensory vectors—but never stalls momentum. The only hairline slip is the clause “whatever cosmic game,” slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete imagery, yet it occurs early and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    High figurative density stays purposeful; no mixed metaphors or loops. One scaffold phrase—“velvet patches over bullet holes” appears twice—minor, outside closure beat. Otherwise propulsive syntax, varied sentence lengths, clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template drumbeat. Metaphors stay coherent (seed veins aligned with doodled bloom). One minor scaffold: “sway without tear” repeats the serenity/motion binary already implicit. Information density high—single sentences do scent + memory + tool work. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract during aerial leaps, lengthen during drift. Information density high—each clause adds sensory or causal data (“roots easing free of soil that would soon forget which way was down”). Zero paraphrase loops; no template cadence. Metaphors stay internally consistent (water as musical score, sapling as prism). Clean grammar; no simultaneity errors. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge motif seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety and information density are high—each line layers sensory data, vector data, or metaphor that advances stance. Figurative language is selective: “pendulum of hanging cable” condenses wind vector and visual in one stroke; no metaphor overcROWDS. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. A single mixed image—“jellyfish halos”—is purposeful, not muddled. Final line resolves by image that recharges “forecast in her mouth,” cleanly anchoring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances image, stake, or sensory pivot. Figurative language is patterned (color = sound) and never muddled; no mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Minor overwriter alert: “wonder needed certification” is the only abstract throat-clearing, but it is rescued by concrete Council threat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence is deliberate, with clause-crescendos that mimic breath filling catacombs. Metaphors are internally coherent—velvet burial, reverse snow—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold-like echo: “avalanchingly quiet” appears thrice; allowed because pattern teaches payoff at closure. High information density: driftwood=bone, salt=sea discard, violet=star-cold; each noun pulls double duty. No synonym churn or template cadence; paragraph cuts test clean.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Compression is high; most sentences carry double duty (image + interiority or action + atmosphere). No paraphrase loops, but three successive “every” anaphoras flirt with scaffold; they serve the liturgical build-up, so momentum survives. Metaphors stay physically loyal (sky as honey-thick air) and do not collide. A single typo-risk: “germinate” used four times—acceptable because the word itself is being re-seeded with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence does two jobs—”Each fern of ice grew along microscopic scratches her fingernails had left, a secret braille he now read” simultaneously advances setting, stakes, and theme. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and exact. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the motif. The only micro-slip is “frozen lightning,” a touch purple, but it occurs after closure and does not dull the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is lyric-dense yet propulsive; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent within loom/orchard domain—no mixed vehicles. Minor slip: “stoically sparkling” appears twice in adjacent sentences, a bead of redundancy that briefly stalls the shuttle. Otherwise, every sentence advances image or pressure; information density is high, and the final petal scarred with runic seam lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for climbs, staccato fragments for arch shudders. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent (arches as sleeping giants) and paid off. Minor density spike in “azure defiance” phrase but pattern is taught early and echoes at closure, earning its repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences braid and tighten like the loom itself. Figurative density is high but purposeful—each metaphor (shard as cicada, bay as loom, ribs as question) returns to charge closure. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; only a single synonym flutter (“shard pulses / shard flares”) prevents 8.8. Copy-clean except one comma splice that serves lyrical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence adds new tactile or spatial datum. Figurative control: “lenses hung like frozen tears” is brief, accurate, internally consistent. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density—“three stacked stones, each smaller than the last, balanced so precariously they seemed to whisper”—packs scale, fragility, animism in one breath. Closure image (“green warmth travel through his glove to the bone”) is clean, uncluttered, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is varied; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“print had died and stars still lied” teaches the rule—so no overwrite penalty. One paraphrase loop: “black flame that cast no illumination yet printed reversed text” could compress, but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure. Information density is strong; each sentence advances image or stakes without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: each sentence layers dye lore, memory fragment, sensory trace. Occasional metaphor stacks (“quietly explosive sparks beneath ribs,” “valley-mist wonder thickening around her”) flirt with purple but stay legible and thematically apt. Zero loops or paraphrase. Final third clean—9+ globally still allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bead of mercury, rolling away unless caught” does triple sensory, metaphoric, and stakes work. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative layering peaks at the spectral trees moment but remains coherent. Final line’s “metallic note tuning her heart” lands as earned cadence, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or emotional information without paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent—tranquility “folds noise into spines,” invitation “rustles like trapped moth”—and physically consistent. No filter-verb stacks; body and environment integrate through action. One mixed image—“heartbeat of the secret library” applied to marble—teeters on personification overload but is saved by immediate tactile follow-through, keeping the beat above artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—“shops forgetting themselves,” “name tags of crust.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent: ovens exhale, guilt rises like yeast, absolution stays unleavened. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” type diction (“mnemonic liturgy”) but it aligns with Mila’s evolved insight and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is near-flawless: information-dense, zero paraphrase loops, metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (light layers as jellyfish, static as god-dandruff). Read-aloud rhythm modulates from glacial long sentences to cracked fragments without algorithmic pattern. One mixed-metor risk—“drowning in reverse”—is earned by the reversal conceit of breath crystallizing rather than lungs filling. No scaffold, no register drift; the elevated diction belongs to a librarian who measures light.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exemplary: information-dense sentences ("Lanterns swung from rusted chains, throwing gold across crates of contraband and faces that forgot their own names") perform triple duty—scene, mood, world-rule. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—slower rolling sentences during vigil, sharp releases at fob transfer. Zero loops, synonym churn, or scaffold detected. Opening and closing lines are texturally specific and frame the emotional arc without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies: long sensory sentences accumulate, then short beats (“Watch.” “Plant this…”). Information density high: one sentence often does scent + emotional shift + world rule. No paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is controlled—only two metaphors per beat max, never consecutive. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Proofing clean; pronoun reference clear despite two women. No scaffold sentences; no synonym churn. Closure sentence is crisp, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from breathless accumulation to crystalline fragments; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purpose-built: “pickaxe kisses” marries violence and intimacy, “mnemonic rescue mission” compresses vocation and filial duty. Information density high—one line fuses sensory taste, emotional state, and plot cue. Marginal −0.1 for occasional adjective bloom (“auroral sorrow”) yet it pays off in closure reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “she understood then that the map did not lead to gold or water but to the repository of every conversation interrupted by catastrophe” performs four jobs—insight, emotional cost, thematic pivot, and world rule—in one sentence. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or image. Metaphors stay coherent (vines tasting truth extends the greenhouse’s biological air-scrub). Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to the staccato of dawn departure. A single hairline slip—“throat tightened with a confession she had never mailed”—edges toward label, but immediate embodiment (“I am lonely beneath my gilt”) rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with calibration: short clauses for micro-adjustments, long rivers for comet arrival. Figurative language is sparse and physics-loyal; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop detected (“the droplets glistened like newborn stars before evaporating into the high blue”)—minor, does not touch closure. Information density high; every sentence advances tuning stakes or sensory data.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses setting, interiority, and stakes (“roses outside the dome bloomed in impossible colors, their petals vibrating with each degree the magnetic field realigned”). Varied rhythm; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (magnetic burn = escape route) and are not stacked. Minor filter-verb clusters (“began to merge”) appear but not in final third, so 9+ not broken.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density: each sentence advances image, stake, or atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled (heartbeat slower than clocks) and paid off. Minor template cadence in “she…she…she” triplet at dawn but serves breath-mimicry. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Final line propels without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; each image advances story or body. “Hangman’s dice clinked...like two tiny bones agreeing on a verdict” does triple duty: object, sound, moral frame. Sentence length modulates with breath and current. Final line achieves constellation spread without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally: long breathless accumulations mirror gravity arcs; fragmentary percussive lines mark the collapse (“They did not return as narrative but as sensation…”). Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors, no filler scaffold. Information density is high: one line often does two jobs (“Its massive body had breached at midnight, crushing three warehouses and scattering the gravity like broken glass”). Minor template echo in “she would return tomorrow, and the next day” −0.2, but it serves cadence rather than clutter. Closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory image, metaphor, and forward motion. No scaffold loops; each crane replication is a new beat. Figurative layering peaks at “galaxy made of absences” but remains coherent under accumulative lens. Final line breathes, giving closure without flab. Minor echo—“tranquil blaze” appears twice—does not dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet legible: “meteor shower intensified, sparks translating themselves against the dark” layers image and metaphor without mixed vehicles. Near-loops (“agreed upon lies” repeated) are purposeful, pattern-taught, and paid off in the final knock for sugar. Information is doubled: the thermos labeled “sugar” also holds tea, a lie that later flips into the next cycle. Only minor scaffold: “I understood then that…” could be trimmed, but it occurs mid-story and does not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, but information-stacked: each sentence does two jobs (image + causality). One mixed metaphor—“bruise inside a garden”—but it’s taught immediately as colour logic and paid off. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with mirror precision. Minor purple tinge in “chlorophyll mist” but momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and coherent—“aurora’s pearl twilight glow,” “stalactites dripped their ancient rhythm”—without mixed-metaphor clutter. Information density is high: one sentence can anchor setting, backstory, and emotional tilt (“The marble sanctuary had been their childhood refuge…”). Final line cadence echoes opening aurora, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Density high: “Their overlapping voices braided into webs of intrigue that tightened around her lungs until she sang to survive” does triple duty. Rhythm breathes—long winding sentences for descent, short beats at cocoon dissolution. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language tied to sonic physics; cliffs “absorb and release” cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent within dream-logic physics. High information density achieved through fused images (“love letters fused into a single diamond of ink”) but two adjacent sentences paraphrase globe projection effect (-0.2). No artifacts near closure; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long tide-swell sentences to the staccato “droplets flew outward in a spiral”; zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; each sentence does dual work—e.g., “stones still held the day’s heat beneath their chill” anchors time, body, and forthcoming spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Density is high—each sentence carries sensory payload and causal leg: “hexagonal scars…taught the bark to crystallize” does two jobs. Metaphors stay coherent (angry cicada, vacuum hush) and do not crowd peak beats. One paraphrase loop: “comfortable lies had grown teeth, and she meant to pull them” → “shovel cut her own hands” is acceptable thematic echo. Rhythm breathes: long sentence for orchard sigh, staccato for playback. No filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“cobalt glass portico” remains coherent as crystallized sound. Rhythm accelerates during download, then fractures in the final line. One minor scaffold: “static between stations” is repeated twice within 30 words, but the second instance reweights the phrase as habitat rather than background.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long oceanic sentences to staccato beats mirroring ice-knocks; information density high—“each note spilled out like warm blood, fleshly ethereal” does three jobs (sensorial, metaphorical, tonal); zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; final line recharges “horizon’s last gold” without scaffolding—clean cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long mapping sentences and clipped climactic beats; no template cadence. Information density high—“moon path skewed, sliding three degrees west”—does triple duty: visual, causal, thematic. Metaphors are coherent: moon as coin, sparks as reverse snowfall; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “mapped while…” anaphora is purposeful, accumulates pressure. Final line ends on resonant monosyllable “breathe,” recharging prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dense layering: boots echo / iron rungs / lantern warm / brass surface—each noun carries sensory weight without modifier stack. No mixed metaphor; tunnel-as-throat remains consistent. One paraphrase loop: "She understood... she understood" within 3 lines → −0.2. Sentence starts vary, no template cadence. Active verbs ("descended," "gripped," "refused") replace nominalizations. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line returns lantern image with accrued freight. Minor scaffold: "memory hit like a train" is stock, but does not touch closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: long sentences for contemplative beats, clipped fragments for spring clicks and dawn slit. Figurative language is selective—dust motes as “slow constellations,” storm clouds “pressed low”—each image doing double duty for atmosphere and moral pressure. No synonym loops or template cadence; scaffolding is minimal. One near-purple phrase—“vibrant hush” repeated twice—edges toward mannerism but is saved by its thematic centrality. Information density remains high; every paragraph advances choice, cost, or sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is near-loop-free; only “like a dying…” is repeated with intention. Density is high—each sentence layers tech, body, myth: “crystal blocks stored deleted memories; each block hummed a different note.” Metaphors stay coherent (stars≠servers) and serve tone. Final line cadence—“listen closely and you’ll hear…”—supplies charged poise without overwriting. One micro-scaffold: “she thought of…” could be cut, but it compresses motive before the decisive palm press.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or causality—no scaffold. Varied sentence rhythm mirrors floe-shift urgency; participles used only when simultaneous action is real. Zero mixed metaphors; glass-pier-sea metaphors stay in coherent liquid/solid constellation. No loops, no synonym churn. Final line bell-ring is acoustic full-stop that seals cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm mimics ice shift: long sentences glide, then crack into fragments at turns (“He turned, eyes wide”). Metaphors stay within sensorial reach—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors cold, reveals motive, advances action). Scaffold screen clean: no synonym loops, no filler stacks. A single over-ornate line—“chime thinner than moonlight”—survives because it pays off sensory specificity at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence can split a metaphor, advance plot, and anchor season (“Autumn had coppered the vines”). Mixed-metaphor risk—“red taillights…last coal”—reads as character-perceived, not authorial strain. Occasional elevated diction (“intersubjective understanding”) is justified by Marco’s nightly self-address to an absent academic listener.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence openings; information density high (“paradox of movement beneath stillness”). Occasional template cadence in the three-fold circling description and stacked adjectives (“murmuring pavilion,” “whisperfield calm”) slightly dull the peak beat; no loops or mixed metaphors that obscure causality, but the density flirtation keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “suspended hush that clung to the air like dust motes in a sunbeam” packs simile with tactility. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or sound sequence. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral of moments, rings in a tree—supporting accumulative design. Final lines achieve echoic cadence without template churn; “she had spoken for the silence, and it had answered” lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (fog = breath, driftwood = bones). Zero loops or synonym churn. Minor register lift (“precognitively forgetful”) is voice-motivated and legible. Closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (“the leaf touched the viewport glass, impossibly gentle, and dissolved into a sound”). No synonym loops or template cadence; each metaphor is physically coherent. Minor overwriting in “escape velocity became a lullaby” but it lands inside lyric pattern taught early. Final line varies rhythm, releases ache into quiet whir—ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, sound, or emotional charge. Figurative language is patterned early (“city lights like scattered embers”) and paid off in final lightning-bolt image; no mixed metaphors under closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence density is high: “she set the rings to rotate backward, clicking the key into a dormant automaton” does three jobs in one breath. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, precise, and coherent. The final paragraph’s lullaby cadence is earned, not template. Minor nip: “continent brightened” could lose “suddenly,” but this is below artifact threshold. Closure image is crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level density is high—“opalized, root curled like a fetus” does triple duty as visual, haptic, and thematic seed. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; register remains internally consistent. One minor scaffold: “the garden smelled of bruised mint and iron” could compress further, but it advances atmosphere and costs nothing at closure. Final image (“lantern in the ribs of the world”) lands clean without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density—one line often carries sensory data, emotional tilt, and causal nudge (“glass drank emerald gloom, returned fugitive glimmers”). Rhythm breathes with pressure: short clauses at flare, longer sweep at dispersal. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; vehicles stay consistent (glass, tide, mirror). Opening and final lines are ear-tested memorable. Hairline slip: “reflectively vibrant” is prompt-echo adjective stack, but absorbed by surrounding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud ear test passes; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual swell. Information density high—single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and forward push. One mixed-metaphor risk (“jeans-torn knees of urban explorers”) but resolved quickly. No synonym churn, no scaffold loops. Clean grammar; only minor tense choice (“rested” vs “lays”) at closure but cadence overrides quibble.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths swell/contract with tide. High density: “fog curled into quotation marks around her ankles” does three jobs. One paraphrase loop: “lucidly watchful” repeated; minor. No mixed metaphor; vehicles stay maritime/print. Clean grammar, tense stable. Final line cadence mirrors opening, completing arc.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose breathes with scene tempo: long clauses during predawn hush, staccato fragments at moonset. Metaphors are consistent—light as liquid fire, pollen as starlight—without mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances clock, body, or song. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. Final line crystallizes cost: “restoring what was never truly lost, only waiting” revalues prior material without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence lengths contract with pressure. Metaphors are internally consistent—starlight as forge, orchard as score—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one line often layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Minor scaffold: “demonstrates patience physically” appears twice; does not obscure closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    High metaphor density is patterned early (“marble cavern exhaled cold light”) and earns its keep; mixed registers appear only in low-pressure lines. One scaffold loop—“echoes that chose to stay behind, nesting in the veins of stone” immediately after “echoes nesting”—dulls momentum; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene needs and closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; each sentence advances either the loom ritual or the suffocating hush. Metaphors are internally coherent—sound as whalebone, silence as metallic tiles—never mixed. The violet flare sentence (“The flame flared violet…”) is peak-stress clarity itself. Opening and closing lines act as audible brackets: starlight enters, metallic sigh seals—perfect cadence control.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear varies cadence; no template stems or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent—wood grain = mane, rust = blood = peace—without mixed vehicle crash. Information density high: “curl that fell carried rust-hued peace” does double job (action + color theme). Minor scaffold: “the way” twice in two sentences mid-text, but not in closure beat, so −0.2 only. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge voice cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “cloudwater lapped at the copper deck, hissing where it touched the hot brass animals” does world, sense, and temperature in one stroke. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors—though “syllable of my own name spoken backwards” flirts with abstraction it later justifies. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor over-decoration in “emulsified dreams” during closure, not enough to dull reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    Almost every sentence layers job—advance image + world logic + character stance. Minor scaffold: “equations the city elders said were unsolvable” could compress. No mixed metaphors or loops; even the zero-mass comet simile is physically apt for raffle tickets. Closure line “portable meridian pointing... inward” is clean, propulsive, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are dense, often doing three jobs at once: “Rainwater pooled in the gear cavities, reflecting a sky not yet certain of its colors” advances story, deepens atmosphere, and reweights the stake. Figurative language is selective, never crowded; mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional near-loop (“excruciatingly gentle” repeated) is forgiven because it becomes incantatory and is pattern-paid at closure. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; the prose stays propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “twilight barge canal exhaled its first cool breath” fuses atmosphere and agentless motion. Metaphors stay coherent (canal = scar, fog = gold ellipses) and serve the emotional math. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. A single overripe phrase—“architecture of lies scaffolded her…life”—is indulgent but occurs mid-story, not at closure, so artifact penalty stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose achieves lyric density without purple drift: “tiny sparks skated across its surface” does double sensory job. Rhythm modulates—sibilant hush matches fog, then hard crack of bead. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay internally consistent (whale-bone creak, harbor moons) and do not collide.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Density is extreme—every line carries metaphor, back-story, and forward motion—yet paraphrase loops are virtually absent; each re-statement adds a new strand of meaning. Mixed-metaphor risk is high but controlled (“geography of healing,” “weave of absence”) because the metaphor family (textile + map + garden) shares root images of interlacing. One scaffold phrase—“the geography of healing”—recurs three times; since it is the conceptual stake, the repetition is thematic echo, not padding. Closure beat is uncluttered, allowing the final sentence to land clean.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with action: long clauses for suspended sway, staccato fragments for pin-rearrangement. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last (“sky…punched-in,” “chandeliers…frightened stars”) without contradiction. Information density high—one line can world-build, deepen character, and escalate stakes. No artifact touches the closure beat; final line ends on open-mouth vowel that trembles like the ribbon itself.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: single sentences layer job credential, sensory data, and moral weight (“firefighter’s coat unzipped to the salt wind”). Figurative language is sparing, never consecutive; each metaphor is purposeful (clouds like kelp, skin like lava). Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm breathes with the scene—long inhale for description, clipped exhalation for action. Proofing clean; no typos or ambiguous pronouns.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Information density high—“memory of water lingered in every dry basin” does three jobs. Figurative language is patterned (sidereal, breadcrumb, perfume) and resolved at closure. No mixed metaphors; loops or scaffold absent. Final image crystallizes without clutter, meeting 9+ bar.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: four-beat anaphora (“petals…petals…petals…”) mirrors slow-motion bloom, then fractures into shorter pulses as gear blurs. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor (petals, bell, sonar, wave) returns charged in closure, avoiding purple overload. No mixed metaphors, no synonym churn. One scaffold trace: “quiet sigh of falling petals” repeated thrice; because it reweights at end, penalty waived.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density—“each poem traded at dinner was a small death”—performs triple duty (metaphor, plot, theme). Rhythm modulates: long sentence for swarm-spelled poems, then staccato clause “Inside this living tomb, she understood.” One scaffold: “thundering calm” repeated twice; pattern justifies echo. No mixed metaphors; closure beat crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety is orchestral: long breathless coils of clause followed by hammer-short beats (“The pendulum hovers.”). Information density is high—each sentence performs at least two jobs (image + causality, memory + stake). Figurative control is near-flawless: “black glass hissing like hot iron” is fresh yet physically accurate; only one mixed vehicle (“orange grief” on iron bones) momentarily abstracts. Zero loops, zero scaffold; the final line’s monosyllabic tick-tock is earned, not forced.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the night’s descent. Figurative density is high—“starlight drips,” “metallic kiss”—yet each vehicle is physically grounded and paid off at closure. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym churn; “tenderly organized” appears once and is earned by tactile tool arrangement. Minor scaffold: “the dead wager memory” is repeated almost verbatim from border text; the echo is purposeful but still noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with ascent and dissolution; sentence variety avoids algorithmic drumbeat. Metaphors stay internally coherent—kingfisher quill drinking warmth, lake as unwritten page—without purple overload. Only hairline slip: occasional stacked modifiers (“groundedly imaginative as glacier-melt”) but they serve the lyric pattern and do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences advance both image and causality (“She emptied her inkwell and filled it with powdered rosin…”). Figurative layering is high but patterned—rosin, dust, mist, embers—avoiding random metaphor churn. One mixed vehicle: “mist is clouded testimony” drifts toward abstraction, but does not touch closure. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like the chair’s dying motion—long sentences that rock, then abrupt stops. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work without purple overload. A single mixed metaphor—“planets around a dying star” beside “mathematical impossibility”—is hairline but does not obscure causal clarity. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each recurrence (powder, spiral, mask) re-weights rather than repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—time as gear eating teeth—and do not crowd peak beats. One paraphrase loop: “abrasive calm” appears twice; the repetition is purposeful, echoing the city’s self-inflicted friction. Information density is high; every paragraph advances discovery or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences do triple duty: “the empty circle immediately drank the lamplight” reveals setting, object stakes, and metaphor in twelve words. No scaffold; each paragraph cuts cleanly—remove any one and you lose scent, syllable, or sawdust. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: velvet inside-out returns as “velvet air grew heavier,” preventing metaphor sprawl. Rhythm modulates from legato opening clauses to staccato final fragments, propelling the acoustic diminuendo. Zero loops, zero register drift, zero simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences perform double duty: “She sliced it thin, arranging the crescents on a cracked ceramic plate once used by her mother” advances action, anchors backstory, charges theme. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each metaphor (galaxy-fruit, sundial-scars) is precise and non-contradictory. Information density peaks in the 7-breath countdown without clarity loss. Final line seeds “mysteriously full of plum-colored seeds” propels off-page consequence—propulsion sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies: long honeyed clauses for dusk settling, staccato for match-strike. Metaphors are precise—wax “proboscis,” cones “petrified sunflowers”—never mixed. Information-dense: one sentence often layers sensory detail, world rule, and emotional charge. No scaffold loops; cooling metal ticking returns only to mark time passage, not filler. Final line cadence opens outward, mirroring open gate.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. One minor paraphrase loop—“houses remember louder than the people” echoed by “she understood that displaced objects…leave cavities”—but the rephrasing adds conceptual depth, not filler. Mixed metaphors are controlled (“salt and cedar blood” reads as sensory synesthesia). No artifacts intrude on closure; final paragraph breathes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Density is lyric-high yet information-rich: single sentences layer stone physiology, telepathic taste, and historic guilt. No template cadence or synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent within aquatic/mineral logic. Micro-clip: “gardens of sea-grass that bowed like courtiers” risks ornament but is immediately grounded by flake-shedding calcified certainty. Closure line breathes without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level propulsion is high: information-dense lines (“ghost-weight of a hand that once almost held hers”) do double atmospheric and emotional work. Zero loops, no synonym churn; each metaphor is internally consistent (steps fold like paper—physics of infinite confinement). One near-overwrite: “heart ticking like a gear with a missing tooth” borders on stacked metaphor, but the image of asymmetry justifies it. Final line cadence mirrors staircase falter, satisfying read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in cadence to mirror breath and brush-stroke tempo; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Information density is high—one sentence can layer scent, history, and tactile motion. The final “green prints on the pavement” condenses motif and consequence into one image, fulfilling read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure—catalogue sentences cascade, dough moments contract. No mixed metaphors; “flour whitening her dark hair like premature frost” is precise. Information density high: one sentence labels, embodies, and foreshadows. Zero loops or scaffold; even repeated “waterfall” serves as sonic metronome rather than filler.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines (“time folded like paper; the maker saw two futures”) advance story and image simultaneously. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new physical or causal information. Mixed metaphors avoided; lighthouse as bell, yoyo as escapement mesh cleanly. Final whispered thanks replaces explanatory paragraph, earning concision.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language rarely repeats without payoff. "Roadkill can look jeweled beneath headlights" compresses attraction/repulsion in one stroke. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. One mixed vehicle—"mirrors arranged to make me look long enough"—skirts abstraction but arrives before the climax, leaving the final salt-image unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Rhythm mirrors turtle gait—long sentences sweep, then sudden tremor-short beats. Every clause carries double duty: “sunwashed dread thickened” fuses tone + stakes + temperature. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by recharging “sunwashed dread” with new, terrible chart. High density without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but three consecutive sentences open with “She…” in the 7-sentence cluster starting with “She found the waiting room.” Metaphor density is high yet coherent—no mixed vehicles. Information-dense: one sentence often does three jobs (place, memory, thematic hint). Minor scaffold: “heartbeat” spelled in Chinese pinyin jars register; likely artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences layer action, sensory detail, and conceptual weight—“She pressed the stamp against the water’s surface; phosphorescent plankton briefly outlined the glyph.” No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent—blackout as “held breath,” applause-like drips. Rhythm accelerates toward blackout extinguishing, then breathes out with lantern relight. Clean grammar, tense stable, pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear is musical; sentences vary from short gasps to long winding coils without algorithmic feel. Information density high—each image carries craft, grief, and world-rule. One mixed metaphor (“lanterns that would glow each night for anyone who needed light shaped like goodbye”) grazes over-writing but occurs post-closure; no loops or scaffold inside the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“geode’s dust swirled into patterns resembling wedding guests raising champagne flutes”). Metaphors stay coherent under physics-of-grief logic. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final third is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: expansive twilight sentences contract to metallic clang at print. Metaphors stay coherent—stars as “captured lightning”—without mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold: “the dying light” appears twice in four sentences; minor paraphrase loop. No artifact touches the closure beat; final line is clean, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: caesural semicolons slow the terrace dread, then staccato shore discoveries accelerate toward the climb. Information density is high—each sentence layers metaphor, back-story flash, and present action without scaffold: “wood remembers its original shape” simultaneously comments on Elias’s moral state and foreshadows the carved face. Metaphors stay coherent within the maritime/woodworking lattice; no mixed vehicles. Minor filter-verb cluster in first paragraph (“made Elias think,” “seemed a kindness”) but cleared once on-shore action begins; artifacts do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “moon remembers tide” does triple duty—voice, world-rule, foreshadowing. Metaphors organic (thunder as prowling engines) without stacked overload. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Minor filter verbs (“felt”) occur early but vanish during climax, preserving immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    High metaphor density but pattern is taught (“merrily melancholic god”) and sustains rather than obscures causality. No mixed metaphors, loops, or scaffold; information density excellent—one sentence flicks paddle, faith, and black water. Slight register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase nudges below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences dual-load image + stakes (“bioluminescence crawled under his skin, illuminating bones like paper lanterns”). One template cadence—“the ___ that ___”—recurs three times but serves incantatory effect, not artifact. Mixed metaphor only once: “cold fire” is justified by luminescent fluid. No loops or scaffold; final line soldered image is razor-clean.</question>
    
    <question>8</question>
    <grade>9.2</grade>
    <comment>Premise fuses memory-wipe sci-fi with penitential pilgrimage; the baseball-from-a-redeemed-future is a fresh causal hinge. Risk is high—lyric accumulative structure could collapse into symbol soup—yet pattern is taught early and closure re-stitches time as iterative repair. Specificity (“ticket stubs to games that never happened, each dated tomorrow”) makes the trope un-portable. Tightening loop image earns +0.4 risk bonus.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    High figurative density risks purple drift, but each metaphor is rooted in spice or orchard ontology, so coherence holds. No loops or synonym churn; sentences vary openings. “Blossoms opened backward” is vivid yet precise. One mixed vehicle: “cracked the night open like a pomegranate”—night as fruit is momentarily jarring but forgivable at lyric pitch. Final line lands clean, recharging “die again” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Paragraph lengths visually echo cardiac monitor: long during climb, single-line spikes at 3:42, 4:17, 5:03. Metaphors are interlocking—cloud/apology, crack/lightning, tea/memory—never mixed; each reappears to carry causal weight. Zero loops; no sentence opens with identical cadence. Information density high: “hairline fracture glowing with the memory of every sip” fuses object, time, and emotion in one clause. Closure line—“teaching the clouds to forgive themselves for raining”—recharges every prior meteorological image without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: image + emotion + physics rule. No loops; each metaphor extends the maritime-gravity conceit. Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths mirror sail unfurling. Only hairline slip: “bloomed with vines of light” edges toward purple, but bloom is literalized by ship-seed grammar established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety avoids template cadence; metaphors organic to setting (lava “his,” bottle “bell”). High information density: one sentence can anchor eclipse, braid shadows, and foreshadow path. Occasional lyric stack—“violet hush,” “vibrant hush”—borders excess but serves accumulative design. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary from compressed s-accusatives to elongated semicolon chains, tracking breathless hush. No template cadences; “murdered torch bracket” and “bruised violet” are fresh. One mixed metaphor—“voices were thin kites snagging on surprise”—momentarily muddles acoustic with aerodynamic image, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphor density is high but purposeful—each vehicle extends the photo-chemical lexicon (“silver halide and starlight,” “negative space between stars”). No synonym loops or template cadence; clauses are varied, propulsive. One near-mixed metaphor—“timer’s bell rang, thin and polite”—is minor enough to leave the 9-band in sight.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates from hydraulic hiss to soft brook murmur; high info density—each sentence advances image or blade tension; no loops or mixed metaphors; “foils sheathed, the dignified chaos still humming” is a clean, propulsive closer.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to clipped beats under Rourke’s threat. Figurative language is selective, never piled in high-pressure beats; mixed-metaphor guard is clean. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density remains high—each sentence advances character, image, or tactic—while retaining read-aloud musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. High density: “cracked face reflecting the ceiling’s flickering fluorescent bars—each stutter a reminder that time itself had once promised forever and then reneged” performs three jobs (visual anchor, theme seed, emotional valence). Metaphors are coherent within physical logic (cloud-roots tugging greenhouse downward → fog pouring through perforations). Read-aloud rhythm modulates with ascending ladder (short clauses) versus cloud-garden release (longer breath). No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or cost. Figurative density is patterned—dream-dragon scales, orchid-petal memories—so overload penalty waived. Sentence variety high: participial openers, em-dashes, fragment for thunder. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “luminous doubt.” No mixed metaphors; physical logic consistent (seed sprouts inside interpreted dream, not literal soil).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but patterned: metaphoric vines serve the ritual logic, never overwrite. Rhythm modulates from tidal hiss to piano rain to final stillness; no template cadence. Information dual-loads—lace threadbare arabesque carries both tactile and symbolic weight. One mixed metaphor (“counting heartbeats the world had forgotten”) is minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in “humidity still clung like a guilty conscience”—mixed metaphor slightly muddles physical logic. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure beat (“drama is optional; change is not”) avoids summary by anchoring in embodied departure. One near-redundancy: “ruined splendor dwarfed her instruments” and later “greenhouse’s ruined splendor” — negligible drag.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent and coherent—glass/frost/charcoal motifs interweave without contradiction. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths mirror emotional cadence (longer in reflection, fragmented in action). Minor overwriting in “bubbled into braille-like ridges” risks purple prose, but it’s redeemed by immediate tactile payoff (“blistering her lips”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image remains sharp despite poetic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (“ocean lay flat as polished steel”; “diamond dust of shattered glass”). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in climax (“silent aurora of instruments: brass rivers, percussion constellations…”), but metaphors serve theme without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “pages of compacted salt unfurled into corridors” merges setting, action, and metaphor). Figurative language is consistent—glass, light, salt, and books recur without contradiction. Minor overwriting appears in “column of chased stillness” (slightly abstract), but it’s redeemed by immediate embodiment (“neither sound nor silence but the interval between heartbeats”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally, and the final paragraph echoes the opening bell motif with transformed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “wheels disguised as ordinary vendor noise” compresses surveillance, subterfuge, and sound design in one phrase. Figurative language is purposeful (“dawn bruised the horizon,” “scent rising like unbanned prayer”) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “intergenerational support coded as food lists”—a rare abstract phrase amid otherwise concrete prose. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“petals drifting like slow fireworks,” “lungs rattled like dry seedpods”). Figurative language is pattern-taught early (sparks, lucidity, breath-as-medium) and paid off at closure (“breath tasted… transparent”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“colors separating into layers of withheld tenderness”) slightly blurs causality, but never obscures the closure image. Rhythm varies masterfully—paragraphs breathe with the characters—and the final lines land with resonant simplicity: “the road ahead smelled equally of wisteria and beginning.”

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves near-flawless density: each line advances plot, character, and atmosphere (“leaves brushing her cheeks with wet memories of rain”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—halo light “retracts into a single white point,” bridge planks “curl away like burning film”—with no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety creates propulsion: paratactic urgency during disintegration, lyrical cadence in reverie. Only minor deduction for slight over-compression in the climax (“garden shuddered... bridge disintegrated”), where one extra beat might clarify causality without slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose achieves high information density: “feathers of iridescent cellophane peeled from forgotten teddy-bear prizes” conveys setting, history, and resourcefulness in one phrase. Sentence openings vary (“She had waited...”, “Now the cuffs...”, “The arrow had been...”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm mirroring waltz-like tension. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“sunlight pouring in like brass band music”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but clear—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“cells divide in cambium layers” ties biology to theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught: colors as sound, sound as texture (“hemorrhaging russet,” “cello roar”). Minor overwriting in “aurora bled across the sky” slightly muddles vehicle coherence, but no loops or scaffold. Final line’s “wound and blossom in the same breath” crystallizes theme without redundancy—propulsion never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence multitasks (e.g., “jar of captured moonbeams clinking softly against her ribs” establishes object, sound, and embodiment). Figurative language is coherent—moonbeams as ribbon, tears as mercury—and avoids purple excess. Minor density in mid-paragraph (“illuminated moment—someone’s widest smile…”) slightly slows momentum, but rhythm recovers for the climax. Zero paraphrase loops; syntax varies purposefully (fragments for tension, complex sentences for lyricism).

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“steam braided with sweat,” “fault lines of sorrow”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (thaw as emotional/meteorological force) and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “mercury dreams for tomorrow’s colors” slightly dilutes peak-beat clarity, but closure image remains sharp. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (fire-building → laughter → dome placement).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “iron shelves listing under the weight of forgotten scripts” conveys setting, theme, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is pattern-taught (rust, stars, frames) and payoff-earned. Minor density in peak beats (“scalped half-shell, its pink lip fractured yet still able to cup an ear”) borders on ornate but doesn’t obscure clarity. Zero paraphrase loops; syntax varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (silence as amber, hush as marbling) and coherent. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“glittering dust that clung to her fingerprints like guilty evidence”) slightly dilutes clarity but doesn’t obscure closure.

Minor scaffold in “eyes that held galaxies” leans cliché, but it’s redeemed by later specificity (“surprised eyes reflecting the chip’s glow”). Sentence variety supports emotional arc; no loops or register drift. Final line’s lift into night mirrors thematic ascent without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “gulls seem to swallow their cries,” “genealogist of ghosts,” “wood remembers its original shape.” Figurative language is consistent (organic, maritime, artisanal) with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in one mid-paragraph (“mermaids with eroded breasts… children’s faces smoothed featureless”) slightly slows momentum but doesn’t obscure closure. Final lines achieve rhythmic inevitability without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence multitasks (e.g., “coat heavy with salt and regret” establishes setting, character, tone). Figurative language is coherent—leviathan pull, squid-grief ink, moon as blade—and never muddles cause/effect. Rhythm varies purposefully: staccato during tension (“Thunder prowled”), flowing in resolution. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; even peak beats avoid therapy-speak (“fear that kept them awake” feels lived, not clinical).

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“regrets began as a cold thread...”). Figurative language is coherent—compass as broken bell, pain as percussion—and avoids purple overload. Minor density in mid-section (“latitude by longing, longitude by loss” followed by brine/forgiveness metaphor) risks slight overwriting but pays off in closure. No loops, scaffold, or register slips; final paragraph’s “widening yes” crystallizes tone without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but clear—each sentence advances character, plot, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (stitches → constellations → silver solder) and never muddled. Minor deduction: slight over-compression in the climax (“pain circulating, diluting like ink in an ocean that chose to stay bright”) risks abstraction, though it recovers instantly with “responsibility, heavier yet cleaner.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose maintains high information density: “moon-moths, lullaby foxes, a three-headed hare who weeps pearls” conveys mythos in seven words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fire = memory, spices = time) and pays off in the feather-of-flame branding. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence propels. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the climax (“bones hollowed, feathers budding”)—still clear, but borders on simultaneity strain.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: “boots leaving no print on silver moss” establishes character, setting, and theme in one image. Figurative language is coherent (clouds as “cathedral of vapor and regret,” crack as “river”) with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“choking beauty” appears twice) triggers slight density penalty, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary (“She carried…”, “After the birth…”, “Now she knelt…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional propulsion. Final line’s “porcelain rivers” elegantly reprises the saucer motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hull stitched together from the ribs of a dozen dead cruisers” does worldbuilding, character, and atmosphere in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Figurative language is coherent (ship as coffin/seed, Tear as green eye) and peaks without muddle. Minor deduction only because “ghostly resolve” in final line slightly echoes prompt—but integration justifies it. Read-aloud rhythm varies masterfully, from staccato welds to flowing auroras.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (glow, glass, texture) and pays off in closure without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“vibrant hush,” “molten choreography”) slightly dilutes momentum but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism; no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs anchoring abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “torches were cold, the sky… bruised violet” establishes mood economically. Figurative language is purposeful—“sparks fly,” “drifting swans”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “gears clacked awake… waltz of citizens” slightly softens climax, but rhythm overall serves pressure. Zero loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Closure image (“secret smile shared between sunrise and the gently inventive earth”) earns its lyricism through prior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (light/sound motifs) and never contradictory. Minor overwriting in the opening (“colors too vivid for the hour after friction had vanished”) slightly slows momentum, but the rhythm accelerates cleanly toward the climax. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; even elevated diction (“ochre, indigo, vermillion”) fits Elias’s meticulous worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“masks slip, the soul exhales”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (storm as darkroom, scars as maps) and never muddled in peak beats. Minor overwriting in “furiously tranquil” repetition (twice), but no loops or scaffold. Final line’s cadence (“storm-kissed, wondering”) resolves with earned lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, conflict, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“stitch time,” “hidden overture”) and culminates coherently without muddle. Sentence variety supports rhythm—short thrusts during fencing, flowing clauses by the brook. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; even elevated diction (“diplomatically fierce,” “dignified chaos”) fits the academic-philosophical milieu. The final line (“the destination began to answer”) resonates without overstatement, closing the motif loop cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but clear: every line multitasks (e.g., “pages scatter like startled doves” conveys action, atmosphere, and theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (molting, blooming, wings) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in climax (“luminous fracture against iron” borders on abstraction), but rhythm varies effectively—staccato during sirens, flowing in recitation. Zero loops or scaffold; closure image (“desert will remember how beauty clawed itself from anarchy”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (pigeons, compasses, grafting) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in the arbor description (“cumulus pillows,” “atmospheric breaths”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s clarity (“Onward,” “fearless note”) earns its resonance without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“empirically whimsical,” “luminous doubt”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“each orchid and vine glowing as though unsure it existed”) slightly slows momentum, but rhythm recovers swiftly. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; sentence variety supports emotional cadence. Final line (“half real, half dreamed”) echoes the opening with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line performs multiple duties (e.g., “rain dripped from needles in slow piano notes” establishes sound, mood, and rhythm). Figurative language is coherent—apologies have color, memory has tide—and avoids mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“The tide hissed…”, “He was…”, “I had come…”). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats (“bruise-blue to the soft dawn tint that rises just before words form”), but clarity at closure remains pristine.
