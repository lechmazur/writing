  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"dust that, under her spectrometer, might reveal patterns older than the greenhouse itself" combines action, possibility, and temporal scope. Some figurative density in peak moments ("glittered like frost," "bruised morning light," "motes swirl like galaxies") serves the accumulative pattern without obscuring clarity. Minor repetition of "gradual change" concept could be trimmed, and the abrupt ending mid-word reads as artifice rather than purposeful truncation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong figurative language occasionally tips into overwriting ("flames licking rafters like wolves tasting blood"). Template cadence appears in the final third with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. The prose achieves moments of excellence ("frost told her the smugglers had passed") but lacks consistent restraint, particularly in the studio-opening sequence which shifts to more abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong propulsion with vivid imagery, but several instances of abstract phrasing reduce immediacy: "silently expressive" appears twice, "the expression silently expressive" is redundant. Template cadence in the sequence "She struck...she struck another, then another" and some synonym churn around thermal/heat/warmth. Information density is high but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with memorable phrases like "books breathing underwater" and "fire translated grief into light," but some template cadence appears ("He traveled...descended...followed," "He located...found...opened"). Minor redundancy in explaining the library's function reduces momentum, though the closing image lands with high density.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "clay tiles humming with the wind that carried the scent of blocked harbors and empty markets." Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful compression. Some minor repetition in phrasing ("gently persistent" appears twice) and occasional abstraction ("eyes bright with distrust") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the atmospheric opening. Some middle passages edge toward overwriting ("filament of unspoken love, the unused stuff") and abstract phrasing ("storage is not a place but a posture"). The closing image sequence recovers momentum beautifully. Prose serves the accumulative design but occasional opacity dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("the texture of time at last: not smooth, not sandpaper, but wet clay"). However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy ("retrocognitively trapped," "false continuity of self"), and some metaphors strain coherence (halos as fragments that are also moments). The final truncation ("in the folds of that internal labyrinth") appears unintentional.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation and purposeful metaphors, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("staggering in its grace," "staggeringly graceful moment") create template cadence. Some filter constructions ("She could not let them pass") and repetitive use of "patient strategic" dilute immediacy in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though density occasionally overwhelms clarity ("the ashen forge under aurora glowed ahead: a kiln built from ships' ribs"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical vehicles strain logic (collecting intangible absences with physical tools).

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong opening and closing lines with varied sentence structure throughout. Template cadence appears in middle sections ("The thief..." starts multiple paragraphs), and "illuminated moments" becomes a repetitive phrase rather than evolving motif. Some overwriting in descriptive passages dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory detail and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("emotional tectonic shift," "fault lines of sorrow") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density reduce momentum. The dramatic narration quotes work well but occasionally the figurative language becomes strained ("heart light enough to lift her footprints off the ground").

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the tyrant's legitimate heirs would announce that the family brand—my bruised body double brand—was being retired"). Some metaphorical excess appears ("stars spilled through the holes like unpaid extras") and occasional register elevation, but momentum sustains through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in the cataloging of silences. Some abstract phrasing ("endless night whose citizens were absences") and occasional register elevation ("geography she drew") create minor friction. The prose serves the lyric design but could be more consistently grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful repetition that serves the loop concept. Some overwriting in metaphorical moments ("frozen strings vibrating with unplayed music") and occasional redundancy ("frozen courtyard at twilight" appears 6 times). Line "thoughts came from the friction between what was and what could be" lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching emotional beats. Information density is good - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor repetition of "resonant hush" and some slight overwriting in atmospheric passages ("plankton in the beam").

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("She understood," "Elara understood," "understanding that") and occasionally strains metaphors (marbles as "constellation of broken memories"). Several sentences could be compressed without loss, particularly the extended middle passages about the garden's knowledge, though the opening and closing images land with appropriate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong rhythmic control in passages like "she saw the moth-bats leave the aviary, evolve into sky-whales" creates propulsion, but abstract phrases like "holographic principles" and "subdued awakenings" occasionally obscure concrete action. The recurring "mechanically warm" and wing imagery provides textural coherence, though some sentences could compress further for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops damage momentum: "wordless conversation" concept restated in lines 7, 25, 26; "between-spaces" recycled five times with minimal variation. Template phrasing appears in sequential "He'd/She'd" constructions. The prose achieves some lyrical moments but repetitive abstract phrasing ("spaces between," "liminal existence") and conceptual redundancy significantly dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Snow hissed against shutters; the anemometer spun above, counting heartbeats no one claimed"). Clear propulsion through varied syntax. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("foxed by decades") and abstract compounds ("auroral sorrow") that momentarily blur immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"rails ended at a rusted bulkhead door stenciled 'GHOST SHIFT ONLY—NO EXIT'" simultaneously advances plot, builds atmosphere, and foreshadows entrapment. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks create visual rhythm. Minor figurative excess in places ("diesel-pink light") but the industrial-religious fusion language serves the central concept throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("silver scab over the wound of daylight"), with high information density and varied syntax. Some repetitive phrasing around "regenerative silence" and "cryptic folds" creates minor loops. The unfinished final sentence works as intentional truncation matching the theme of incompletion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information-dense prose where most lines advance atmosphere and meaning simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("black disc crowned with white fire") works within the lyric mode, though occasional abstraction ("interval between heartbeats when someone realizes they are alive") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information-dense prose where most lines advance atmosphere and meaning simultaneously. Some figurative density in emotional beats ("axis settle under her sternum") and occasional abstraction ("bronze quiet replacing the hollow"), but the lyric mode earns this compression. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression, though occasional overwriting appears ("lithophone—stone keys that chimed when tide struck them"). Some metaphor density in non-peak moments (-0.3). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. The final image of "the key of salt and departure" resonates without forcing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("silence that remained was whole, not hiding"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrases that could be more concrete ("stillness unraveling" without fuller sensory grounding).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with most sentences doing multiple jobs—"The lake's mirrored horizon rippled, showing her tomorrow's face exhausted, eyes ringed like tree stumps" combines setting, time-bending, and urgency. Some figurative density in peak beats without clear payoff ("tie-rod loosening inside her chest"). Prose is generally clean but occasionally strains for effect over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. However, several instances of purple prose ("cathedral bones," "a beast stitched from every moment") and abstract phrasing that occasionally obscures clarity. Some repetitive constructions ("Kael stepped," "Kael walked," "Kael understood") create mild template cadence. Information density high but sometimes sacrifices clarity for style.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid sensory specificity ("needle thinner than moth antenna," "hides stretched like moonlit lakes"). Some figurative density in places ("filament of hush" recurs perhaps too often) and occasional abstraction ("translucent layer from the numb cocoon") that slightly dulls immediacy. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the hush felt borrowed, as though someone had paused the world." Some density issues in expository passages ("inside it, instruments recorded uncensored weather, the raw screams..."). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting. The final sentence runs long but maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with most lines carrying multiple functions, and the prose achieves moments of exceptional clarity like "a ribbon of liquid moved slower than tears, as though reluctant to volunteer for evaporation." However, some metaphorical density in peak moments ("hothouse of the chest," "irrigate the desert of their lungs") creates mild opacity, and occasional paraphrase loops appear ("grieve in the way lantern brokers do: quietly").

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong rhythm and imagery but suffers from repetitive constructions ("I walked because... because... because") and abstract loops around "texture of time" and "impossible choices." Information density varies—some lines do multiple jobs while others restate without advancement. The closing sequence gains momentum despite earlier redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity like "brittle ribs of orchids" and "sky wore the color of old pennies." Some elevated register drift ("vast, simple magnificence") and occasional abstract phrasing ("beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation") that could be more grounded. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("bloomed like a bruise," "honeyed regret, sharp with the citrus of almost-joy"). Some density issues in peak beats - "cathedral of static and scent" and multiple metaphors cluster without full integration. The "vials sewn into the lining" and later "a vial cracked" create clean bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good information density and varied sentence structures. The opening and closing sentences effectively frame the piece. However, several instances of elevated diction clash with voice ("whimsically attentive," "cautious exuberance") and some paraphrase loops appear ("compassion, like tide, must return" echoes the cyclical theme already shown). Template phrasing in places ("Together they," "Before parting").

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("luminescent ache of belonging," "webs of kinship") and mild repetition of "shared" undercut precision. The prose occasionally reaches for elevated diction that doesn't fully align with the marsh-reed sculptor's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong syntactic variety and information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("gargoyles yawned, reshuffling their wings into positions they had held last Tuesday"). Some elevated diction borders on purple ("womb of resonance") but serves the lyrical mode. Minor loops in the ending section with "memory"/"memories" appearing redundantly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, though occasional abstract phrasing ("locus of possible intersections," "arithmetic of delight") borders on purple prose. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "I [verb]" constructions. The final image effectively recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("oxide surface flaking like dried blood"). Some overwriting in figurative density ("sapphire hush" appears 3x, "constellation of voices warming the air") and minor template cadence in fragment listing sequence. Information density high in opening establishes world efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery like "lightning spider-webbed across the sky" and varied sentence structures create momentum, but template cadence appears in runs like "She released...stopped fighting...felt her consciousness." The extended epilogue contains some paraphrase loops that dilute density, particularly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with some strong images like "defeated army" for the tide and "broken tooth" for the monastery. However, several instances of overwriting ("haggard awe burning in her chest"), abstract phrasing ("unearthed convergence of past and present"), and the final paragraph's shift to elevated register about evolution and species-level observations. Some repetitive constructions around "understanding" and "meaning" that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("stalactites dripped luminous water that never disturbed the surface") but suffers from repetitive use of "steadily unpredictable" (3x) and abstract constructions like "bright darkness" (4x) that become refrains without deepening. Several sentences attempt too much simultaneous work, creating density that obscures rather than enriches, particularly in the dimensional crystal passage.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("salt crust on my coat and the title ocean-spray archivist") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("reactively visionary") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but repetitive phrasing weakens momentum—"starlit vault in mist" appears verbatim three times, "cracks in pavement forming arrows" four times. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("ultramarine," "sigil") without clear payoff. The closing image achieves propulsion despite these loops.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("tide pool...tiny salt galaxies"), though some abstract phrases ("patterns of continued becoming," "hollow space she had sculpted") create slight opacity. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "unheard symphony" without sufficient variation weakens momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Möbius sigh," "polar hunger"). However, repetitive "hush" motif (appears 4 times) and some overwrought constructions ("hollows of his formerly infinite heart") create minor density issues without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("dawn was a bruise over the city"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("granite liquefy into possibility") and minor template cadence in the middle section. The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece, though some sentences could be tightened for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("dragon-breath coal," "wax that smelled of cedar and smoke"), though occasional density issues arise with stacked metaphors like "footprints recording minutes the way a sunday records hymns." Some near-repetition in phrasing ("earnestly studious" appears twice, "incandescent restraint" echoes mechanically) creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/atmosphere). Strong rhythmic control and syntactic variety. Some figurative density in peak beats ("laminate skin," "calcify into a new name") but coherent within the lyric mode. The truncated final sentence prevents full assessment of prose closure, though what exists shows strong control.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with memorable lines like "truth ought to remain porous" and effective rhythm variation. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("gloomy cheerfulness," "ephemeral compass") and some repetitive constructions in the middle section ("He retold," "Arlen retold") create minor momentum drag. The closing paragraph achieves excellent propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "jugglers and oyster poachers" establishes both carnival chaos and economic survival. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful fragments. Minor deduction for "hopeful desperation flickering across their faces like投射的火花" containing an untranslated fragment that breaks flow.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is exceptional—nearly every line advances atmosphere, stakes, or character simultaneously. Prose achieves clarity without sacrificing texture: "The inspector felt the blush before she saw it: the buried half-grain warming through the basalt, its pink bloom seeping upward like diluted blood." No loops or scaffolding detected, with varied sentence structures maintaining momentum through the 43-minute countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    "Hummingbird drone whose glass wings had cracked" and "lumen-veins that guided its flight" show strong specificity. However, several abstract phrases like "magnetic calm" appear twice, and some sentences over-explain rather than trust the image. The prose is competent but occasionally reaches for poetry without earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Ice groaned beneath her boots," "walls ribbed like throat cartilage"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in several passages and some abstract phrasing ("worrying tranquility," "subtly confident") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong sentence variety and propulsive rhythm, particularly in action sequences. Some overwriting in figurative language ("silence...like smoke that had forgotten how to rise") and occasional abstract phrasing ("vacuum begging to be filled"). Information density generally high with most lines doing multiple jobs. The final sentence runs long but maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "knees bruised by pressure and guilt" conveys physical state, emotional burden, and time passage. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral," "liturgy") occasionally strains but serves the mythic tone. Information flows cleanly with strong syntactic variety and no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The walls drank the words and glowed faint copper"). Strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("the hush ahead grew heavier, as though the word had mass") and one template moment, but prose propels effectively through surreal transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagery and selective detail create atmosphere, but several instances of elevated diction ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous") appear without full pattern-teaching. The unfinished final line creates an artifact. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Some repetition of "winter-cracked fields" and similar phrases without evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagistic density and varied syntax create good momentum. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("orchid solace," "hauntingly optimistic") and some metaphors stretch too far ("using his own unrest as needle"). The prose occasionally prioritizes beauty over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures that support the accumulative build. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("roots threading warmly curious fingers through the bones of ancestors"). Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("gravity tugging her back toward a faith") and slight overwriting in the mirror sequence, though neither touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "carefully inventive" (used three times), some abstract passages that could be more concrete ("surrender of words to time"), and occasional overwriting ("golden arcade at dawn" repeated verbatim). The paraphrase loop about mailing/not mailing in paragraphs 13-14 dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Recursive phrases like "flame from eternal candle" and "echoed silence" create intentional pattern but occasionally slip into template cadence. The phrase "disguised wisdom as foolishness" appears three times with minimal variation, creating a loop effect that dulls momentum despite apparent thematic intent.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose rhythm with effective variation, though some passages lean toward density ("cryptic medium, her hair dripping tide-pool silver"). Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative language accumulation in emotional peaks ("lantern made of salt and song") but pattern feels taught. Template cadence avoided, though occasional synonym proximity ("healed/healing").

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments of compression ("shrapnel-eyed and shrewdly innocent") and varied syntax support scene rhythm. Information density high in lines like "the coral had once hosted chromatic fish; now it hosted my sleeplessness." Some overwriting in figurative language ("lotus-hearted, petal-soft yet root-deep") and occasional template phrasing in transitions reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("fog kept its ancient silence," "masonry like a graft that heals two broken branches") with good rhythm variation. Some overwriting appears ("fermented stars," "centuries of orchard light arrested mid-kiss") and the phrase "pensive mirth" feels forced. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, though abstract moments like "joy, once lost, hides behind spectral dust" reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("hobo nickel," "rabbit-skin glue," "tesserae"). Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some register elevation in peak beats ("coinage of attention," "nested inside one another") creates mild distance. Template cadence appears briefly in the three awakenings sequence. No major artifacts but occasional over-density slows momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with vivid moments ("moonlight taxed itself for the privilege of existing"). Some template cadence in middle sections ("Arlo replied...The answer came...He exhaled") and filter-verb clustering around perception. Overreliance on participial phrases creates simultaneity confusion in action sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "centuries of longing" appears four times with minimal variation. Template cadence in middle section ("He touched... He understood... He peeled...") creates mechanical rhythm. The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but accumulates enough minor artifacts to prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves high density with phrases doing multiple jobs, though figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure. Some metaphor vehicles strain logic ("museums of extinct feelings" as physical space). Information density is strong but occasionally tips into ornamental description that slows momentum in middle passages.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in peak beats ("audible light," "captive sounds"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for the incomplete final sentence and occasional abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("cold kiss of history," "nervous confession"). The technical details integrate smoothly without exposition dumps. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph with repeated "Council arrived... Gardeners in..." structure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the meteorite chip is proof, seed, and mother's lullaby vessel). However, the repeated phrase "learning to trust again across learning to trust again" is a clear paraphrase loop, and there's template cadence in the "She [verb]" constructions through the middle section. The prose artifacts don't touch closure but prevent excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions (setting/character/theme), though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("the space between heartbeats," "air thick with memory"). Minor paraphrase loop between "necessary distances" iterations, but propulsion maintains through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the drowned kept their own time" establishes both temporal distortion and personification). Some figurative density in places ("horribly beautiful orrery whose gears had rusted solid") but serves the accumulative mode rather than obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing: "emotional resonance," "emotional fossils," "emotional residue," "emotional echo" create synonym churn. Template cadence appears in "She understood then...She gathered...She walked...She stood." Several mixed metaphors muddle clarity ("foam of forgotten time," "crystallized memories that settled into crevices"). Information density varies; some paragraphs advance little beyond restating the missing pieces concept.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("moonlit and waiting for the water to rise again," "waves slapped barnacled pilings in 5/4 time"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for filter verb cluster ("Cass, lightly attentive, noted every variable"), awkward construction ("She lightly attentive watched"), and slight overwriting in places ("The calculated wilderness of the arcade").

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the verse-inscription sequence. Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("absence refused to remain empty; it grew teeth") but remains coherent. Prose propulsion accelerates effectively during the dance sequence with varied sentence lengths creating visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. However, several issues accumulate: "prism atrium in mist" appears twice without clear meaning, some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("debts of beauty unpaid"), and occasional overwriting in metaphor density. The final third recovers with cleaner, more propulsive language.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("moonlit ridge path wound like a silver scar") but suffers from occasional redundancy ("hard softness" appears multiple times) and elevated register that strains naturalism. Information density is generally high, though some metaphors edge toward purple prose in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("serene upheaval" appears twice, "dandelion clocks in hurricane season" strains) and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. The filter-verb stack in paragraph 6 ("felt," "woke remembering") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("blackened edges fluttering like moth wings," "film negative strip curled like a sleeping serpent"). Deductions for repetitive structure in the diary section ("Vale wrote that...," "The diaries had warned...") and some abstract phrasing ("pure cadence, a heartbeat of guilt"). Information density high in most beats but occasional redundancy ("echo she pursued"/"echo she had been hired to trace").

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the singing/dancing sequences. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("beautiful lies that evaporated"/"beautiful impossibilities," multiple variations on transformation). The incomplete final sentence is a significant technical flaw. Some overwriting in metaphorical density during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing ("manifest in the precise positioning," "beauty flawed by responsibility") creates opacity throughout, with multiple paraphrase loops restating the same concepts. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions, and the incomplete final sentence literally cuts off mid-thought, severely undermining line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"calcified nest" conveys both time and preservation. Some repetition of "fractured grace" and "echo" feels purposeful for accumulative effect. Minor filter verb clusters ("he'd heard," "he saw," "he understood") in middle section slightly dull immediacy but don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with strong imagery ("mercury tears into tiny stars that orbited her throat"). However, multiple template patterns emerge: "Between sigh and smile" repetition, abstract concept-stacking ("collective awakening," "conduit rather than commodity"), and some purple drift ("kelp in an invisible tide"). Filter-verb clustering in middle section dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages like "smoke curl into equations of regret." However, repetitive constructions appear ("Lucien began," "Lucien gathered," "Lucien packed") and some passages loop conceptually (the ethical storytelling theme restated multiple times), preventing entry to higher bands despite the generally polished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with moments of beauty ("blushing stillness," "wire cathedral wrapped in wings"). Template cadence appears in "She had chosen...She had found...She descended" sequence. Some paraphrase loops around the temporary/transient concept. Information density is moderate; several passages could do more work.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of overwriting ("technically gentle" appears twice, "snowmelt ardor" feels forced). Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs, though some metaphors strain ("lost wax caster turned midnight archivist of breath").

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The storm approaches like a memory of thunder"). Some figurative density in peak beats borders on oversaturation ("Lightning unthreads her name; rain rewrites it in shifting syllables") but maintains coherence. Deduction for abstract phrasing ("negotiating its own escape," "one another's becoming") that could be more concrete, and occasional template cadence in the middle dream sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in discovery moments. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, elevated diction occasionally obscures clarity ("empirically ironic that pure number"), and some phrases like "dusky harmony" and "encrypted devotion" repeat without evolution, creating mild template effects.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"uniform still smoldering, eyes hollow with the moment a sniper erased his future." Some template cadence in the middle section with repeated "Lira [verb]" constructions. Excellent final line about the box's "pins still broken, its lesson intact" charges the closure without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and high information density. Some elevated diction ("irreversible," "inextricable") occasionally strains the craftsman's voice. The incomplete final sentence reads as intentional elision. Minor template patterns in "he would"/"he had" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"boots crunching on plaster saints" establishes decay while advancing movement. Some figurative density in places ("deciduous vows that had fallen like leaves") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean prose overall with strong sentence variety.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language like "memories instead of fruit" and "spiral staircase of light" creates density without overwhelming. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision: "brightened disquiet" appears twice, "simply complicated" feels forced, and some philosophical passages border on purple prose. The final incomplete sentence works structurally but feels slightly gimmicky.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("descended a staircase disguised as a glossary"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("crystal paragraph," "comma slicing his wrist") serves the magical-realist mode but occasionally strains clarity. Minor repetition of "carefully resourceful" and slight overuse of botanical-linguistic fusion metaphors, though these support rather than obscure the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and psychological state). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("blissfully aberrant sensation") but generally serves the lyric mode. Final truncation reads as intentional rather than error, matching the pattern of dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information-dense prose with strong moments like "each strand carried a memory: a treaty unsigned, a lover unreached, a child unborn." However, abstract formulations accumulate ("confusion into clarity" appears 4 times, "warmly methodical" 3 times) creating mild template cadence. Some metaphor density in peak beats reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She pressed the echo chamber stone to his lips; the relic drank the words"). Some template cadence appears mid-story ("She knelt... She lifted... She wrapped"). The syntactic variety generally supports the accumulative rhythm, though occasional overwriting ("hammered repose") doesn't fully earn its figurative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong opening "boots crunching on fragments of skylight that had once sung with dawn" and resonant close. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract constructions ("patience of salt wind," "hope in the shape of ribs") and some filter-heavy passages that reduce immediacy. Prose remains clear but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("mist that had turned to stone an hour before the fog became solid") but suffers from density without purpose in places. Several metaphors strain clarity ("the collective memory would carry the signature forward disguised as a child's urge"). The ending truncates mid-sentence, suggesting incompleteness. Information density is high but occasionally tips into opacity rather than resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some minor repetition of "chant" and occasional elevated phrasing ("ambient awareness filter") that slightly dulls immediacy. The incomplete final sentence reads as intentional ellipsis rather than error.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("warmly observant"). However, some overwriting in figurative density - "grotto felt like a throat between worlds" followed immediately by "limestone ribs glowing phosphorescent." Template cadence appears in lines 22-24 with repetitive "The chronicler" openings.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("painted the inverted sky with audible colors that only the claustrophobic could see"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("membrane clung, stretching her skin until the contracted chambers of her heart unfolded like paper cranes") risks opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the terrace drifted three meters east every minute" establishes both physics and pacing. Some figurative density in places ("frozen sigh," "cloud-sea," "glass bricks humming") but serves the lyric mode. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("vaulting hush Nilo cultivated") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant template cadence runs ("She had...She pulled...She stepped...She emerged...She sat") and filter-verb clusters dull immediacy. Mixed metaphors ("paint peeled like old skin," "frozen blood," "geological strata") create coherence issues. Information density suffers from descriptive passages that don't advance pressure, though no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong opening and closing lines, though middle sections contain repetitive structures ("She [verb]" patterns). Some figurative language borders on overwriting ("frozen tears," "terrible sunrise") without clear pattern-teaching. The phrase "loaded emptiness" appears multiple times without evolution. Information density is adequate but could be tighter in the ritual explanation passages.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("air tasted of copper spores and unpaid invoices"), though metaphor density in peak beats occasionally obscures ("mycelial lace," "barometric scars" in quick succession). Some template cadence in middle section ("Lira crawled... Where the hose ended... Inside") but momentum recovers for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dust like powdered light," "each rotation a generation") but suffers from density overload and some purple patches. Multiple filter verbs cluster in exploration sequences ("Arin knew," "Arin breathed," "Arin sensed," "Arin detected"). The "eloquently silent" repetition works thematically but creates mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose control with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of overwriting dilute impact: "shivering bliss," "factually mystical," redundant "smiled—an expression rusty from disuse." The repeated "Reality shifted" works as pattern but risks mechanical feel by the fourth instance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple functions, but several metaphoric reaches strain coherence ("archives are futures disguised as pasts," "history had just been rerouted"). Template cadence appears in the dust-reading sequence ("First came...Next...Then") though it creates purposeful accumulation. Minor loop in "small kindness" repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "starlight braided into copper, coded freedom ringing off the hook." However, several instances of elevated register drift ("auric lagoon," "coded freedom") and some density issues with metaphorical language appearing too frequently in high-pressure beats. Template cadence appears in places ("She waited... She threaded... She adjusted..."). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some repetitive phrasing appears ("prism atrium in mist" x3, "dewdrops form" x4, "quietly vivid" x3). Prose rhythm varies effectively to match scene pressure. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("He remembered...He understood...So he began") but the closure passage is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("She emptied a pouch of moonstone cabochon dust speck—scraps left from the midwife's legend"). Prose propels through varied syntax without loops or scaffolding. Some figurative density in emotional beats ("mossy delight curling around her ribs") approaches overwriting but doesn't obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm that supports the accumulative structure. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("the ashes of his certainties") and some repetition of "uncertainty/certain" that borders on thematic insistence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though "luminous regret" appears three times and "kintsugi intentions" four times, creating mild repetition. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The incomplete final sentence and some ornamental phrasing ("factually mystical pulse") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative control with purposeful density—"modestly fearless heart ticking like a quiet metronome against the ribs of dawn" does triple work establishing character, mood, and time. Information density high throughout, though "colors no tongue could name" edges toward cliché. The syntactic variety from long opening sentence to short "The giggle heard its own reflection and paused, quivering" creates effective rhythm. Some mild overwriting in peak moments but no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("cathedral of invisible fire") and purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("slug of metal that had grown into my skin like a wedding ring made of scars") and occasional register drift into academic exposition. Information density high but occasionally tips into ornamental rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. However, abstract phrases like "anchors of intuition" and repeated use of "elusively tangible" create opacity. Some template cadence in middle sections ("I pause," "I step," "I walk"). Strong opening and closing lines partially offset these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("silk hat perforated by starlight"). Some minor repetition around "dust accumulation patterns" (4 instances) but it's pattern-taught and pays off. Strong syntactic variety and momentum, though "hairline fractures" appears twice in proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"glass apples cracked, revealing seeds of ticking numerals" combines setting transformation, time motif, and thematic rupture. Some elevated diction ("armillary," "vellum") fits the archival setting. Minor register elevation in "negotiable sky" and "perfect system" but these serve the conceptual frame. Strong propulsion through the rupture sequence with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, though some sentences strain under ornate metaphor ("the baroque asteroid... like a gilded coffin"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional abstract philosophizing that slows momentum ("empires and revolutions alike were only footnotes in the margin of a larger collapse") and slight overwriting in figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("walls breathing with the low hum of forgotten chimes") and some abstract phrasing ("feeling the paradox"). The "mending what isn't torn" repetition works thematically but risks becoming precious.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("brass expedition compass washed into the storm-drain, its glass cracked like a wink"). Some elevated diction ("politeness excused it") occasionally strains but doesn't obscure meaning, and the prose maintains momentum through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("chisel ringing like a small bell against salt-gray wood") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Some phrases approach purple prose ("gears of salt and starlight"), and abstract formulations like "timewoven alliances" recur without gaining clarity. Information density is high but occasionally sacrifices momentum for atmospheric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs (setting/theme/character). Strong figurative coherence throughout, particularly "etched glass catching moonlight like frozen breath." Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("the dawning hush is") and some repetitive constructions around "quietly driven" and "umbral tenderness."

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("scallop edges for vowels, black urchin spines for stops") and good information density. The "throat full of salt" and "kerosene onto a ready flame" push toward overwriting without quite breaking coherence. Some template cadence in the middle exchange sequences ("I offered... In return...") that could vary more, though the pattern serves the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("salt-crusted skiff onto the splintered pier"). The abrupt truncation and some abstract phrasing ("memory is still at work here") create minor momentum issues without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the wax shaving is warm/musical/prophetic simultaneously), though occasional abstraction ("the archive had inverted") and slight template cadence in the middle reduce immediacy. Final image achieves strong propulsion through concrete transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Strong moments of concrete imagery ("leaves black-green, bark silver as starlight on snow"). However, the "borrowed time" conceit creates opacity through abstract metaphors ("velvet over iron, soft seconds draped across an unforgiving core") that don't fully clarify. Some ornamental language doesn't advance story ("river of quiet fire"). The piece maintains momentum but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some ornamental metaphors slow momentum ("moon that looked nailed to the sky"). Information density high in technical passages. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions mid-story. Strong propulsion in the bell-ringing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but abstract phrases like "hush of the overlooked era" and "flourishing stillness" create occasional opacity. Some template patterns emerge ("Night after night," "Years later"). The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but inconsistent concreteness prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with purposeful imagery, though some repetitive phrasing around "tranquilly perceptive" and abstract constructions like "tangled covenant" that resist concrete visualization. Strong opening and closing lines. Occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages ("bees of light swarming from her eyes") without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in descriptions like "Fragment of final container, carries the echo of last exhalation, trades for one genuine shiver." Some template cadence in middle section ("He realized... He understood... He asked...") and slight overwriting in metaphoric passages dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagistic precision ("barbs still holding the violet of dawn," "clouded to the color of old longing") with information-dense lines that advance both external and thematic pressure. Some elevated diction borders on purple ("burnished hush of morning deepened") and occasional abstract phrasing ("harmonizing discord into a loom of almost") that slightly dulls immediacy, though the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose density is high—most sentences carry both literal and metaphoric weight ("roots to clasp, compress, and ultimately reshape"). Minor repetition of "gently systematic" and some filter constructions ("Mateo felt," "he watched") prevent higher scoring. The final image lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetitive phrase structures ("She had," "She walked," "She understood") create template cadence, particularly in opening sequences. "Bronze quiet" appears three times without evolving meaning. Some overwritten passages ("luminous skeptic," "faithful companion") clash with scientific POV. Information density varies; several paragraphs restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for repetitive "narrow vastness" phrase (4 uses) and slight overwriting in figurative density during middle passages ("helical seeds that spun like propellers").

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the wild hush that follows artillery and the deeper need to translate distance into closeness"). Some figurative density borders on excessive ("spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise") but serves the accumulative design. Clean propulsion despite complex syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the station hum beneath the shutdown, a lullaby for the blessed pariah") but suffers from occasional overwriting and register elevation. Template patterns appear ("He had come here tonight because," "Kael understood then that") and some metaphors strain (photons as letters). The ending's shift to omniscient "visitors would find" works but feels slightly detached.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Strong rhythm variation and syntactic control. Minor metaphor density in places ("coat billowing like torn moonlight") but serves the lyric mode. No loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("nomadic penumbra drifting just outside the circles of lantern light"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition in walking patterns. Slight overwriting in metaphor density ("stone mouths shaping vowels of air that tasted like iron and lilac") without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    While individual sentences show craft ("The mercury-glass seer pressed her mirrored palms"), the prose suffers from density issues with abstract concepts stacked without breathing room. The incomplete final sentence is a critical flaw, and several passages loop through synonymous descriptions of buried talents and home-making abilities.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("cobblestones like thick felt," "thunder now matching the storm outside"). However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("penance disguised as geometry"), some filter-verb clusters, and occasional purple prose ("steel-blue glow of the frozen moment") accumulate to dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for multiple instances of elevated register drift ("sufficient," "inextricable"), some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("the truth—refracted, shared, borne"), and minor template cadence in the "She [verb]" pattern through the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong propulsion through varied sentence lengths and the chain-countdown creates momentum. Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("tectonic teeth grinding," "star reversing gravity") and minor filter-verb clustering ("she saw," "felt") reduce immediacy without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("gulls screamed like circular saws eating the sky"). However, several instances of elevated register that feel performed rather than natural ("cathedral veins," "negotiating with the land"). Some paraphrase loops around the preservation theme. Information density is good but uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though some conceptual repetition occurs around "vibrations of intent" and "purified intentions." The prose occasionally strains with abstract phrasing like "screaming tenderness of someone who has loved a broken thing too long." However, the lyric coherence mostly holds and the final image lands cleanly without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative control with purposeful density, though occasional opacity ("raw solace" appears twice as unclear modifier). Some mild repetition in phrasing patterns ("she had," "she carried," "she stepped") but rhythm varies sufficiently. The prose serves the accumulative design but has moments where metaphor stacks reduce immediate clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("fruit glowing pale as moonlit bones"), though some metaphorical density in high-pressure moments approaches excess ("threads like piano wire," "lightning calligraphy" in close succession). Information density remains high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but occasional template structures appear ("I foraged, spoke cautiously to the wind, and waited").

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density in lines like "boots clanging, the sound swallowed by mist so completely that each step felt erased." Several instances of elegant compression throughout. Deduction for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in investigation sequence and occasional abstract phrasing around "borrowed memories" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "granite scraping his shoulders" and "fungi bloomed like constellations trapped underground." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for the truncated final line that feels more like technical error than purposeful effect, and occasional overwrought moments ("forest that locals claimed had no heart").

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("bleeding starlight that seeped from the sky like a wound"), it suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff (-0.5). Several instances of paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the dream/memory concept (-0.4). The phrase "ember grotto on the ridge" repeats awkwardly, and some metaphors strain clarity ("air thinned into lace, a lacy menace").

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("elastic as caramel," "ribbons that tied past to future") and occasional template phrasing ("tumbling out with urgency"). Information density is good but figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong syntactic variety and rhythmic control, particularly in the soaring eagle passage and the snow erasure sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract constructions ("grief for a life she had not yet finished failing to live") and occasional template phrasing ("She understood then") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density high—most sentences carry multiple functions. However, several metaphors strain logic ("fog pressed against windows, turning the workshop into a diaphragm") and some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("humanize every future client whose pain she could not smell but could midwife into story"). Strong opening/closing lines partially compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the platform description establishes danger while revealing tradition), though some figurative density in peak beats ("crystallized breath shattering outward into motes") and one paraphrase loop ("scars had become stories, and stories...know how to fly" restates the transformation). Strong propulsion through varied syntax maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"She carried an antique perfume bottle stoppered with black wax" establishes object, atmosphere, and ritual preparation simultaneously. Some metaphoric density borders on overwriting ("moonlight smiles on broken glass") and occasional reaches for elevated diction ("Apologética in C Minor"). The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, though some passages risk purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information-dense prose with purposeful repetition ("resounding hush" frames and closes) and strong syntactic variety. However, abstract phrases like "cosmic illusions" and "universe's hiccup" resist concrete grounding, and some metaphors strain clarity ("words crawled out...ants of ink").

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant repetition issues: "razor edges" appears four times, "fjord quiet" three times, "eminently peculiar" twice, creating template-like patterning. Sentences beginning with "Through counting backwards" create mechanical cadence. The prose achieves moments of clarity but suffers from overwriting in peak beats with mixed metaphors (clocks as both shepherds of memory and measures of distance).

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "sapphire-lit caps" and effective rhythm variation. Several instances of mild overwriting ("quiet wildfire racing her pulse" appears twice; "echo finally arriving, not as sound but as light") and occasional register elevation that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong propulsion with vivid verb choices and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("planetarium of second chances") and some filter-verb clustering in reflection passages. The "clover melancholy" repetition feels forced rather than pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("ink-dark," "soft finality of a book snapped shut") though occasional density in descriptive passages. Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some repetition of "loop" serves thematic purpose. Prose propels through varied syntax though a few passages could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("haunted euphoria" appears twice, "proximate causes" twice) create mild repetition. The abrupt truncation at "motel" harms momentum at closure. Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs, though some philosophical abstractions ("when context changes, artifacts become verbs") slow the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsion with varied syntax and purposeful fragments like "Ticket for one, Ms. Voss?" Information density high throughout, particularly "Mumbai chai-wallah, leapt to a Moldovan beekeeper, and finally reached her through a misdialed fax." Minor repetition with "polite" appearing three times weakens impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("cane tapping, following the only trail he trusted"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("consonants of extinct birds, vowels of children who would never be born") but serves the synesthetic conceit. Minor repetition of "ultrasonic forest" and occasional abstract phrasing ("uncharted emotional depths") but momentum sustains through varied syntax and strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the editing sequence where shorter sentences build tension. Some conceptual redundancy appears ("confident uncertainty"/"confidently uncertain" repeats the paradox), and occasional abstract phrasing ("meaning threshed from the husk of error") borders on purple prose. Information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple layers.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some passages lean toward overwriting ("luminous harbor," "silvering the masts"). Information density is high in places but occasionally dips into abstraction ("forgotten parts of herself rise like tide"). The piece maintains momentum despite its contemplative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "volcanic tenderness" appears four times, "analytically intuitive" three times, "artistic trail/creations" cycles throughout. Abstract exposition dominates ("the greater revelation was that she herself was the final artwork") where concrete imagery would serve better. The prose alternates between purple abstraction and mechanical plot summary without finding a distinctive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagery and rhythm control, particularly in transformation sequences. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "drumming on everything" (4x), some filter-verb clustering ("felt," "understood," "remembered"), and occasional purple prose ("auroral sorrow that now colored the garden's sky").

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in shorter observations ("Looking for someone?") contrasting with longer descriptive passages. Information density is solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for repetitive "whispered" constructions, some filter-heavy passages ("Mira felt," "Mira understood"), and occasional overwrought phrasing ("intersection of her maps, this stranger's inheritance").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("She had been here since..." followed by three "since" clauses; darkness described redundantly as "not evil but lonely, not hungry but empty"). Template cadence appears in multiple "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is moderate but could be tighter—some passages restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in sequences like "pawns advancing backward, knights refusing leaps, kings kneeling." Some elevated diction ("humble rebellion," "amplified quiet") fits the lyric mode. Occasional abstract phrasing ("forests of second thoughts") and light repetition of "humble rebellion" prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the whale-call sequences. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some abstract phrasing ("freedom: not escape but the moment you stop translating") and occasional overwrought metaphors ("cliffs dripping like fresh paint") create minor friction. The incomplete final sentence works as intentional elision.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("television left on after the station signed off") but suffers from density overload in places. Some metaphors strain ("an infant made of endings"). The clinical itemization provides rhythmic variation but occasionally feels forced. Final image of the wrapper as "flag for the morally ambiguous" lands effectively despite earlier density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs (description + metaphor + progression), though occasional abstract phrases like "tremor of certainty" recur without deepening. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the transformation's pace. The finale achieves exceptional propulsion: "somewhere ahead, the cloud-shadow poet listened to the horizon paraphrase itself into a door she had already stepped through."

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("terrible beauty of things that survive transformation") occasionally drifts from Milo's register, and minor repetition of "broken/breaking" concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with intentional rhythm and strong imagery. Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("laboratory of lost sounds became laboratory of found voices" restated multiple ways). Template cadence appears in final paragraphs with repetitive "laboratory of X" constructions. Information density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "coordinates" and "origami figures," some abstract scaffolding ("essential truth"), and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages about transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose occasionally tips into overwriting ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "steadily curious hunger") with elevated diction that strains in places. Some metaphor mixing occurs (cards as both circuit diagrams and monitors). However, sentence variety is strong, and the measuring/mapping language creates coherent texture. The piece avoids loops and maintains forward momentum despite dense figuration.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("fireflies, each light a small defiance") but suffers from repetitive phrasing of key elements across 35+ lines. Information density is high when describing transformations, though some passages loop concepts ("atoms of nostalgia" appears 8 times with varying effect). The accumulative design justifies pattern but execution occasionally feels mechanical rather than musical.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("night air tasted of rain that would never fall again") with strong information density. However, "shadow unbound" repetition without clarification creates opacity, and "softly, deliberately" appears verbatim twice, suggesting template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    Some passages achieve high density ("skin blooming into star-color, quietly vivid against the universe") but others suffer from abstract phrasing and mild redundancy. The phrase "quietly vivid" appears twice verbatim. Several sentences could be tightened: "she felt the animal's weight not as proof of expertise but as living question" abstracts rather than embodies. No major artifacts, but momentum occasionally drags through over-articulated interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied syntax. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("vertebra in the spine of memory") and occasional template phrasing ("I understood"). Information density high in most beats. The "meteor hush" repetition works as pattern but some figurative language feels strained.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, particularly in the discovery sequence. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("incubate the leftover feelings," "emulsion still breathed sentiment") and some metaphors stretch too far ("pigeons that fluttered like white sprocket holes"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("meteor scratched a silver parenthesis") but suffers from density overload and occasional register drift ("forfeited dreams," "disciplinary squares"). The abstract metaphysics sometimes obscures concrete action, particularly in the middle third where conceptual language dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "silver scars disappearing into starlight" conveys physical rails, temporal loss, and cosmic scale simultaneously. Strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression, though occasional abstraction ("divergent archive of all the hours") could be more concrete. No loops or scaffolding, and the figurative language coheres around the central metaphysics of preserved impossibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("boots dangling from a vine of coaxial cable" establishes setting, displacement, and tone). Some figurative density in peak moments ("cyclone of leaves and numbers") but it serves the surreal accumulative design. Minor repetition of "the hum of insight" and "probable miracles" works as purposeful refrain rather than loop.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains strong atmospheric control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, template repetition appears ("They walked," "They found," "Jun stepped") and abstract phrasing like "unused courage" recurs without concrete grounding. Final paragraph truncation suggests generation artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful repetition. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some metaphors strain slightly ("frostbitten hope crystallizing on his lashes"). Minor template cadence in middle sections ("He had been... He carried... He turned...").

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths creating appropriate pacing. Information density excels in lines like "Stone lions along the balustrade roared in silent approval." Some elevated diction borders on purple ("brocade of borrowed starlight unraveling") but serves the mythic register. Minor template cadence in the middle third's "The titan..." openings.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong opening and closing images, but middle sections suffer from abstract phrasing ("assembly of clues," "delayed revelation") and some synonym loops around discovery/understanding. Template cadence appears in the descent sequence ("Down through...she descended...until the seafloor rose"). Information density is good but undermined by occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/atmosphere), though some metaphoric density in peak beats approaches oversaturation ("plasma flowers bloomed"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph structure, with minor template cadence in the climbing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("photosynthetic panic flared") and some register drift into scientific terminology that doesn't fully align with Nara's established voice ("epigenetic switches," "thermophilic moss").

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Tonight the wind combs the cliff with a sound like tearing paper" (atmosphere + foreshadowing + emotional state). Some elevated diction ("arithmetic of continuation") occasionally strains but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures support the dreamlike progression, but several instances of overwriting diminish clarity: "luminescent ache" appears twice, mixed metaphors ("paper wings flutter" for cards), and abstract philosophizing that dulls momentum ("redesign the very grammar of seeing"). Template repetition of rhetorical questions, while pattern-taught, becomes predictable. Information density is high when concrete but lapses into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong moments like "each second expanding into a lifetime of understanding" demonstrate control, but repetitive structures accumulate ("Kael understood...," "Kael let himself...," "They had discovered..."). The phrase "consciously wild" appears three times without variation. Final paragraph contains three consecutive "They had discovered" constructions that could compress into one powerful image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "hissing like distant applause" and "a woman half ice, half fire" demonstrate control, but template patterns emerge ("She remembered why," "She reached," "She slipped"). Several metaphors strain credibility ("each line a live coal in the sub-zero gloom"), and some passages loop concepts ("dizzying quiet deepened... dizzying quiet returned"). The prose achieves momentum but lacks the precision for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of precision ("thorny bushes her mother had planted decades ago") but suffers from occasional redundancy—"patient work of growing things" follows "patient tending." The repeated "inculcating plants with values" phrase appears three times without variation, creating minor template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("iron remembering the moment it once pinned steel to earth, a marriage of force and stillness"). Some figurative language risks opacity ("transliterating emotions visible as colored smoke") but the sonic throughline maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence: "newsprint heiress who smelled of ink and thunder," "starlings scattering into night." Some overwriting appears mid-story ("glowing words collided with the headline, showering sparks") and occasional abstraction ("protagonists passivity"). Information density generally high with purposeful rhythm variations.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variety and purposeful compression that serves the accumulative design. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some excellent specific phrases ("drawers sighed open," "leash on memory"). Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in paragraphs 10-11 and two instances of abstract phrasing ("dissonance of old guilt," "guilt would quiet") that weaken immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but occasional overwriting appears ("lilac unease" repeated 4 times, some abstract phrasing like "meaning felt like chalk dust on her tongue"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph lengths. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She + verb" patterns).

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the 49 pieces both mark time and become art), though several abstract formations ("aberrant mercy had taken root in her chest," "constructing empathy's armor") could ground more concretely. Some template phrasing appears ("She had spent," "She'd watched," "She was constructing") but doesn't pervade enough to seriously impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with vivid sensory detail and good momentum, though some passages lean toward overwriting ("synesthetically blessed seamstress...tasted starlight"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The phrase "fractured timeline" appears three times, creating mild repetition, and occasional abstract constructions ("made them feel time is a song") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("trails of luminescence that hung in the air like ghostly brushstrokes") but suffers from repetitive structures and filter-verb stacks. Multiple instances of "Maya [verb]" openings create template cadence. The unfinished final sentence ("looked at each") appears to be a technical error rather than artistic choice, significantly harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("boots never quite touching the wet stone" establishes both otherworldliness and careful observation). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("an ache older than grammar") but rhythm varies purposefully and propels toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("horn toggles that once closed a sailor's coat during a typhoon"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("hourglass heart inverted") and occasional template phrasing ("She walked on") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong momentum with varied syntax, though some overwriting appears ("silver dust glinting like frost in his wake"). Minor template cadence in middle section ("He thought...He pressed...He expected") deducts -0.4, but the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("fog-bound river crossing" establishes setting, atmosphere, and constraint simultaneously). Some elevated diction risks register drift ("spindrift serenity," "ambient awareness") but serves the mythic tone. Sentence variety creates effective rhythm. Deduction for occasional opacity in metaphorical passages that require re-reading, particularly the palimpsest promise mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagistic precision—"chimney smoke flattened against copper sky," "wings beating in the rhythm of her calm breath"—creates consistent forward momentum. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. However, abstract philosophical constructions ("the fragile, radiant wall between them") and occasional overwriting ("sealing the covenant") dull immediacy. The "phototropic to kindness" construction, while thematically apt, appears four times creating mild repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "watering can that sloshed like a heartbeat" combines action, atmosphere, and emotion. Some figurative density in places ("papery petal lay...like a tiny eviction notice") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Clean propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "striped only in front, brown in back" establishing both physical form and symbolic incompleteness. Some register elevation in phrases like "photosynthesize independence" creates minor friction. The unfinished final sentence works as purposeful truncation rather than error.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("colored light fractured by stained glass, landing on the curved walls like whispered confidences") but suffers from occasional density issues and register drift ("palimpsest," "carillon"). Some metaphors strain ("thread that connects all things" appears five times), and the ending truncates mid-sentence, suggesting technical error.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from extensive exposition and summary, with most dramatic beats told rather than shown. Repetitive phrasing appears throughout ("cosmic tricksters," "power plays," "subsonic frequencies"). Information density is low, with multiple paragraphs restating the same concepts. The final paragraph is incomplete, suggesting structural issues.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("The silence was so total that she heard her pulse rattling like loose rolling stock"). Some figurative density in non-pressure beats but clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "boots grinding limestone into chalk that clung to the mist like guilt" show controlled density. However, template cadence appears ("She descended...She spread...She pinned...She did not flinch") and some metaphor density in early paragraphs ("lance the town's amnesia by unifying opposites") borders on overwrought. The prose achieves propulsion but occasional loops ("memory snapped into place—not her own, but the town's") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of elevated diction drift from POV ("the gravitational pull of legacy," "anonymous dread," "purposeful direction") and some paraphrase loops around the decoding process. The "nervously confident" becomes a tell-phrase rather than embodied behavior after the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic variation and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple layers (atmosphere, emotion, plot). Some figurative language becomes strained ("pixels of permission," "wireframe waiting for skin") and the abstract nouns accumulate in places ("coherence," "mandate," "amnesty"). The prose maintains momentum through varied paragraph lengths and syntax, though clarity occasionally yields to lyric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("moonlight dripped through holes") but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "polished calm"/"calm" repetitions, multiple variations on circularity. Template cadence appears in "I + verb" constructions across several consecutive sentences in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Each petal bore a bruise-shaped syllable"). Excellent syntactic variety and rhythm control. Deduction for metaphor density in peak beats without full payoff and occasional abstract phrasing ("electromagnetic winds") that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative control with purposeful imagery like "blood had steamed on the ice like a war banner planted too early." Information density is high, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstract constructions ("guardian and trespasser both") and some template-like parallel structures in the middle section that briefly slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The whisper spoke of an eclipsed covenant"). Varied sentence structures and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Deductions for occasional abstract constructions ("anxious elation," "root-bound visionary") and the truncated ending that suggests generation artifact. Some metaphor density in peak beats without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of repetitive phrasing ("fiercely gentle" x3, "dusky resolve" x2, "half-lit corridors" x2) and some overwriting in metaphor density. Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple story elements, though the filter-verb cluster ("I felt...I caught...I carried") in the final third dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several passages contain mild redundancy ("quiet but waiting," "confidently uncertain" appears twice). The prose occasionally reaches for literary effect with mixed metaphors (sound wave "drooled" into flat line) that don't fully cohere with the dominant acoustic motif.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("clouds vibrating into concentric circles") and occasional abstract phrasing ("gentle momentum of meaning itself"). The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("love over time is velocity, and velocity over distance is home") but inconsistently.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, strong rhythm variation, and zero paraphrase loops. However, occasional overwrought metaphors ("migrating identity," "wintersun serenity") and some abstract phrasing ("wonder survives only in motion") that could be more concrete. The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    High information density with purposeful figurative language, though occasionally overwrought ("rainbows trapped in mid-sob"). Some abstract phrasing ("walls between hearts," "latent radiance") recurs without always earning its abstraction through concrete anchoring. No loops or scaffolding, strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines like "ivy had swallowed the station whole, green fingers prying apart brick and memory alike" doing triple work. Minor repetition of "daringly methodical" and occasional abstract phrasing ("green testament") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines performing multiple functions (world-building + emotional state + plot advancement). Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly exceeds the POV's established register ("phosphorescent algae," "propagate delays") but prose remains propulsive with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Deductions for occasional purple patches ("sleepless stars," "doorway of clear, silent light") and some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy. The final incomplete sentence "And somewhere beyond" reads as intentional but doesn't fully land.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong control in passages like "each pattern was a fingerprint of final thought," but suffers from density issues with abstract compounds stacked in nearly every sentence. Template structures appear in the listing of death patterns, and some metaphors stretch coherence ("grotto walls breathing like lungs").

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong imagistic density and varied syntax support the lyric mode. Minor repetition issues with "scallop" variants and some abstract phrasing ("kindly decisive" appears twice identically). The prose generally propels through concrete images, though occasional opacity in the grotto transformation sequence slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, but several abstract formulations weaken immediacy ("protected vulnerability" appears 5 times, "honest/honestly" 4 times). Some metaphors strain clarity ("moral radiation without contamination"). The wind chime cipher device adds textural specificity that partially compensates for occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several template patterns appear: "The first ring showed... The second ring revealed... The third ring displayed" creates mechanical repetition. Some register drift into academic abstraction ("temporal meridians," "reverse entropy") without full POV grounding. Information density is high and the closing image lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe paraphrase loops damage momentum: "navigate without moving" concept restated five different ways, "pulse left wandering" recycled throughout, multiple variations of becoming echo/song. Template cadence with "The [noun] [verb]" openings and abstract mystical language ("frequencies," "resonance," "harmonics") that avoids concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The vapor bore him, cool but not cold, across a narrow bridge of condensed moonlight." Some figurative density in places ("brilliant dimness," "lingering luminance") creates minor opacity. The incomplete final sentence works as purposeful pattern but creates slight momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong imagistic density with lines doing multiple jobs: "books stood bolted to floorboards, their spines fanned like sleeping gulls" combines setting, atmosphere, and metaphor. Some phrases like "wander purposefully" and variations on "meteor hush" risk becoming mannered. The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The deck's amber walls glowed faintly, preserving the last light of dead galaxies like insects in prehistoric tree blood." Some repetitive constructions ("She realized," "She felt," "She became") create minor momentum drag. The prose maintains clarity through complex conceptual territory.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with memorable images like "constellations crawled across the dome like silver lice," though occasional density issues appear ("Echo forgotten phrases" seems incomplete). Information density is high but some metaphors stretch slightly ("silver lice" works emotionally but strains physically).

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong rhythm in counting sequences and accumulative passages. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the dripping/manifestation sequences. Some template cadence appears ("He thought of... Of... Of..." structure) and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages ("stitched from rust and regret") without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "each scrap carrying the weight of a private grief she could finally release," though occasional density issues appear ("the mirrored hush inside her chest"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("starlings poured through the canyon like liquid iron") with strong information density. However, abstract philosophical phrasing accumulates in the final third ("harmonize logic and intuition," "solve the mystery, but to sing it rightly"), creating mild opacity. Some near-duplicate concepts (wonder/mystery/reverence) reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("watcher's burden," "burden she carried") and mild repetition of "soundless echo" prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("like light through twin prisms"). Several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy ("emotional numbness," "narrative fog," "paradoxical creed"). Some repetitive "had [verb]" constructions. Information density is good but uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density serves the accumulative mode but occasionally tips into overwriting—"storm-born silence settle over the village like damp wool" works, but stacked metaphors accumulate. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for repetitive use of "storm-born silence" (3x) and "notably receptive" (2x).

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts (short declaratives during action, longer accumulative sentences for memory). Information density is high—most lines advance both external action and internal state. Minor metaphor density in places ("heart macerated itself") but serves the heightened emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of "interiorizing exteriors" that builds meaning. Some passages risk overwriting—"boundaries of light were not edges but invitations to trespass"—but generally maintain clarity. The paraphrase loop around waiting/attendance in paragraphs 9 and 23 creates minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong imagery ("edges sharp enough to slice prayers") but density sometimes overwhelms clarity. Template cadence appears in "He lifted... He knelt... He rose" sequence (-0.4). Several paraphrase loops like "hopeless alchemist"/"stoically sensitive" repetitions dilute momentum (-0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("antennas humming like crickets that had learned grammar"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("sublimated into pure photon") but it serves the fantastical register. Clear propulsion through varied syntax, though occasional abstract loops ("every ending...merely turning around") slightly reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery, but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching ("wake spread in slow motion spirals," "stalactites knitting together like fingers"). Some mixed metaphors ("radio whispered thanks") and occasional register drift reduce clarity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive template cadence ("She [verb]ed" structure) and paraphrase loops significantly dull momentum—"mapping connection"/"texture of connection"/"spaces between us" recycle without advancement. Abstract language dominates concrete action throughout. Information density remains low with multiple sentences restating similar concepts about connection and consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She lifted the chain link, letting it spin like a slow planet" establishes action, metaphor, and emotional state). However, "balancedly curious" creates confusion both times it appears, and some figurative language approaches oversaturation ("horizons could unfold in directions no compass had ever measured"). The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and high information density. Several memorable lines achieve genuine lyricism. Deductions for repetitive "the woman" construction in closing beats and the awkwardly truncated final line that disrupts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative control with images like "fractal burns across reality" and "speed of regret" that serve both atmosphere and meaning. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("copper strand in the long cable between past and tomorrow") risks overwriting but maintains coherence. Sentence variety and rhythm support the descent/ascent structure, though occasional abstraction ("crashing hush replaced by ordinary roar") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid images like "ink splays into ephemeral patterns" and "footprints that match no living pair of shoes." Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("galaxies of spilled midnight," "dendrites of regret, axons of almost, synapses of maybe") creates mild opacity. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the ring descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagery density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("quietly articulate fingers," used twice). Information flows well with varied sentence structures. Some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("copper veins like loose wires") without clear payoff, and minor synonym repetition around texture/sound concepts reduces momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of striking imagery ("laughter bending telephone wires into question marks") but suffers from abstract conceptual language that dulls immediacy ("harmony untamed," "frequency that turned grief into levity"). Several paraphrase loops appear ("the wraith was never the monster" concept repeated across multiple formulations) and the story leans heavily on telling pivotal transformations rather than showing them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "bronze guardians with gears for joints" establishes both threat and theme. Some figurative density in places ("tarnished wonder, as if childhood fairy tales had been left out in the rain to rust") but it serves the lyric mode. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the musical sequence and breathing in contemplative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsive rhythm with varied sentence lengths matching scene tension. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story layers simultaneously. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in metaphorical density ("bruised violet," "borrowed rain") though it serves atmospheric coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density high with most sentences carrying multiple functions—"His name was erased by choice, but the carousel horses remembered him" establishes character, history, and magical realism efficiently. Some metaphoric density borders on overwriting ("green notes on a staff of starlight"), and occasional abstract phrases ("interpreting the hush ahead as possibility") could be more concrete. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—"drifted between the stacks" establishes both movement and ethereal quality. Strong rhythmic control varies sentence length purposefully, accelerating during the transformation sequence. Some figurative density in peak beats ("nautilus logarithms," "mass defect and longing") approaches but doesn't cross into muddle. The prose maintains clarity while supporting the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("coral shelves that hummed whenever someone missed something"), though occasional purple moments ("cathedral of salt") edge toward overwriting. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some figurative language approaches oversaturation ("deer made of light," "river of starlight"). Template cadence appears in "He understood...He laughed...He walked" sequence (-0.4). Final paragraph cut suggests incompleteness but may be intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("accordion her father played the night the ships sank into the orchard"), but several instances of telling over showing ("chronically curious ache," "felt less like rust") and some repetitive phrasing around memory and forgetting reduce propulsion. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with transformed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong imagery and varied syntax create momentum, particularly "she smiled the way a blade smiles when it chooses not to cut." Some abstract phrases ("combative tenderness," "quiet defiance") and occasional density in figurative language reduce clarity. The final image lands with precision and power.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "color of wonder" (appears 4 times) and some abstract loops around "essence" that could be more concrete. The prose serves the lyric mode but occasionally sacrifices clarity for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "She whispered, 'Across sharing a secret, time loosens,' a phrase her mentor had uttered once before drowning himself in silence" establishes world-logic, backstory, and emotional weight simultaneously. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Rain hissed against the leaded skylight...each drop a tiny hammer eroding the painted saints"). Some syntactic repetition in middle sections ("She loaded...she advanced...she pressed") creates mild momentum drag, but prose accelerates effectively toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with memorable phrases like "the library to its quiet, sophisticated melancholy," but occasional density issues with stacked metaphors ("planet forming its own weather"). Some figurative language approaches purple ("cathedral of salt-stained books") without quite crossing into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "petals of every unspoken need she had ever collected lay flattened" show compression and purpose. However, abstract phrases like "needs finally spoken in the language of storm" and some repetitive constructions ("driftingly alert" appears four times) create mild drag. The prose achieves lyric density but occasionally sacrifices clarity for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Deductions for overlength sentences that occasionally blur focus ("she felt the goggles translate..." runs 40+ words) and some abstract phrasing ("affectionately detached") that could be more concrete. Information density high but momentum occasionally stalls in description.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines like "The gondola creaked like an old porch swing, its wicker floor shedding dust that floated in zero-g like miniature galaxies" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("quietly explosive, a filament bulb about to shatter with feeling") and occasional synonym loops around memory/remember concepts. Strong propulsion through varied sentence structures that accelerate during the final sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density high: "Her brush, sable and steel, moves across the curved inner wall of the trunk" simultaneously establishes tool, action, and spatial constraint. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("the sky-shaped absence that holds them together") serves the face-blind perspective. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She understands... She mixes... She works") but recovers for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery ("starlings wheeled in autumn murmurations"). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor weakness in the somewhat rushed final paragraph where multiple resolutions stack quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that accelerates during the key discovery sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere simultaneously. However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("auroras braided overhead through vaulted glass") and occasional register elevation ("custodian of every eclipse yet to unlock") create minor friction without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("condensation swirling where her ankles should have been") but suffers from repetitive abstract constructions around "brambled hope" and occasional overwriting ("the violet itself, a reservoir of respite ready to catch the next wave of grief"). Some sentences prioritize lyricism over clarity, particularly in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"nested patterns of salt-stained iron" simultaneously describes, metaphorizes, and foreshadows. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("vouchsafe") that slightly strains the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean, propulsive prose with high information density - nearly every line advances plot, atmosphere, or character simultaneously. Strong verb choices throughout ("hissed," "spewed," "banked"). No loops or scaffolding, though "graceless beauty" appears twice identically when variation might have enriched the echo.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("grief itself had pupated and hatched too late"). However, some overwrought metaphors accumulate ("ear nested in her chest," "moonlight loosens its grip") and occasional template phrasing appears ("Behind her," "By dawn"). The scientific terminology reads authentic but dense figurative language in places reduces clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"bottles of moonlight, each labeled with a parole word" establishes object, magic system, and linguistic theme simultaneously. Some conceptual abstraction dulls momentum ("quantifying absence could she map the negative space"). The prose avoids loops but occasionally privileges philosophy over clarity, particularly in passages about the library as "seed crystal." Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph structure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("turning grief into something that could hold life again"). Deductions for occasional overwriting ("sturdy brittle song") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("emotionally contagious through touch"). Information density is high but sometimes tips into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose density is exceptional with lines doing multiple jobs ("the astronomical clock tower struck the true hour; the grain elevator answered"). Information flows cleanly without loops or scaffolding, though occasional abstraction ("boundary between mechanical and human breath") could be more concretely embodied. The figurative language serves the accumulative design without overwhelming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Information unfolds efficiently through action. However, some metaphorical density in peak beats ("helical, tightening until she could not tell which longing belonged to whom") and occasional abstract phrasing ("chaotically precise déjà vu") create minor opacity without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers (plot, atmosphere, theme), though some metaphorical density obscures clarity ("seeds of vigilance took root...as a latent blaze"). The recurring spiral-and-dot motif effectively structures the piece, and the final truncation ("whose mind could fracture") creates purposeful incompletion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the slow heartbeat of drying fibers"), and the rhythm varies purposefully to match the ritual's progression. Some phrases edge toward preciousness ("almost-audible mercy") but the overall control and momentum are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition problems undermine momentum: "beauty in the difficult/difficulty" appears 7 times, "magnetic nexus" 8 times, extensive paraphrase loops about chess lessons and exile. Template cadence runs ("He had..." structures) and abstract philosophizing ("every ending contains the seed of a new beginning") replace concrete imagery, while overwritten metaphors blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Deductions for template cadence in the silence catalog section ("the silence of fathers... the silence of flags... the silence that follows") and some abstract phrasing ("theatrical sincerity turning pain into performance"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Some repetitive phrasing ("Myrrh" appears 17 times, "seed" clusters heavily) and abstract constructions ("turning of the tide's thought") that slow momentum. Strong information density in middle sections. Deduction for opening opacity and occasional purple prose ("moon-mulled violets").

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Strong rhythm variation and propulsion. Some figurative density in peak beats ("cathedral of unheard choir") that borders on overwriting but remains legible. Excellent opening and closing lines that frame the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("bruised sky," "nautilus shell of steel"). However, repetitive sentence openings plague the middle section ("She documented," "She understood," "She emerged"). The documentary passages lack propulsion, creating momentum drag. Information density is uneven—some paragraphs could merge without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, though some elevated diction occasionally strains ("oscillating repose tightening like a bowstring"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, and the final line's incompleteness adds resonance rather than feeling like an error.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Its gold leaf caught no sun; the canyon hush drank light the way dry earth drinks blood"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("avalanchingly quiet") but serves pattern-teaching. Minor compound modifier excess but no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong image density, though some metaphysical abstractions ("lucid turbulence," "common denominator of longing") occasionally slow momentum. The letterpress vocabulary creates consistent texture, and key images like "stars burned steadily, having learned the equation" effectively merge the mathematical and emotional registers.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of key phrases. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Minor template cadence in the woman's dialogue and some filter-verb clustering ("Elias saw," "Elias felt," "Elias understood") in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density varies—strong passages like "frost briefly wrote her initials before melting" contrast with abstract loops ("truthful lies...were the only currency"). Template cadence appears in middle sections ("He whispered...He scraped...He knelt"). The "academic heresy" line and "aggregate sorrow" phrases edge toward register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition that teaches its pattern. However, abstract constructions like "impossible distance measured not in miles but in forgotten lullabies" and some overwrought metaphors ("lungs working like bellows") create occasional opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong verbs ("slag sighed," "gong rolled"). Information density is high—most sentences advance plot and atmosphere simultaneously. Some template cadence in middle section ("Corin heard...He wrapped...He clanged") and occasional overwriting ("bruised-azure shadow") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("the bay's ruined geometry fold inward, bulkheads bending without motion"). The phrase "cyclically spontaneous" appears three times, creating mild repetition. Information density is high but occasionally tips toward opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The sound was the feeling of safety trying to fit inside metal" advances action while revealing character psychology. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph rhythms. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in places ("starless dark" could be "starless") and one instance of mild redundancy in emotional description.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    Strong moments of clarity and propulsion ("She laughed, and the sail billowed, towing the lighthouse off its foundation") alternate with overwrought passages that stack metaphors without advancing pressure. Some lines achieve genuine poetry while others feel artificially elevated ("scanning constellations into foam that hissed forgotten obituaries"), creating uneven density that occasionally obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The blue morpho wing, now saturated with narrative, no longer fluttered"). Some mild repetition of "valley-mist wonder" and occasional density that borders on overwriting ("quietly explosive"), but momentum remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density remains high—most sentences advance both literal action and metaphoric weight. Some repetitive phrasing appears ("mundane miracle" twice, multiple "witnessed/witnessing") but functions as pattern-teaching. Prose occasionally reaches for elevation ("stormlit silence") but maintains clarity through concrete anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves high density with lines like "fruits split to reveal clockwork seeds ticking backward" doing multiple jobs. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("tarry vines," "audible light," "spider-webbing surface" cluster without breathing room). The "scattered memory keeper" epithet repeats mechanically six times. Strong information density and momentum but mixed metaphors ("moths against glass" vs "pulled stitch") create minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the stacks exhaled a hush so complete") but occasional abstract phrasing ("enlarged tranquility" appears multiple times) creates mild opacity. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Minor template cadence in the middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of sharp specificity ("flour ghosts," "breadcrust armor") but suffers from abstract loops ("creeping normality" appears 4 times without variation) and elevated diction that occasionally obscures ("heuristically gentle" never gains concrete meaning). Information density varies—some paragraphs advance multiple layers while others circle concepts without progression.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("brass-rimmed spectacles" establishes character and era efficiently). Some elevated diction borders on purple ("blinding alliance") but serves the lyric mode. Minor repetition of "gently meticulous" and occasional abstract phrasing ("determination crystallized") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful compression, but figurative density occasionally obscures ("bruised lavender," "speared through cracks"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("truce of hush" concept restated), and filter constructions accumulate ("I realized," "I knew," "I felt").

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("aurora paint memories across the sky"). Information density generally high with multi-functional sentences. However, several paraphrase loops appear (weather-carrier descriptions repeat similar concepts), and abstract phrases like "terrestrially cosmic existence" lack concrete grounding. The cut-off ending damages clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but overwriting appears throughout ("pickaxe kisses," "wings of quartz and feldspar"). Mixed metaphors strain coherence ("memory earning its wings," "tunnels not cages"). Template cadence in the final third ("She left...She sold...She woke...She sketched") creates repetitive stems that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("ghost made of ink and pollen" metaphor) and the abruptly truncated final sentence that disrupts closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("fist of ice older than any nation") and good information density. However, abstract phrases like "color of wonder" appear multiple times without concrete grounding, and some sentences strain with ornate construction ("electromagnetic tail would pluck the kinetic ribs like a bow across an infinite viola"). The final image lands cleanly despite these periodic density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves strong imagistic density with lines like "each bloom becoming a tiny sun." Information density high throughout, with most sentences advancing multiple layers. However, abstract conceptual phrases ("fragmented wholeness," "becoming") occasionally muddle clarity, and some paraphrase loops appear ("containing chaos"/"contained chaos").

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong images like "the way sand waits for wind," but several paraphrase loops appear ("listening, not answers, is what finally heals" restates the motivation). Template cadence runs in the middle section ("She set...arranged...waited"; "They said...swore...began") and occasional purple patches ("plum to peach") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the dice are compass, verdict, and chance incarnate). Strong verb choices throughout ("germinate," "anchoring," "sketching"). Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("calm defiance stitched into every pause") that borders on overwriting but remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("crystals cracked, shedding shards that hovered, then rained upward") but suffers from occasional overwriting in figurative language ("gravity smiles—imperceptibly, everywhere at once"). Some synonym churn appears ("deleted"/"erased"/"redacted") and the final incomplete sentence creates unnecessary ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments: "He spoke one word—not the code, but its inverse, a sound shaped like the hole at the center of a flute." Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some abstract loops around silence/hush concepts and occasional overwrought metaphors ("terrestrially cosmic" repetition, "tranquil blaze" appearing 4 times).

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("borrowed cup of sugar" as both literal and metaphorical). Some repetition of "agreed upon lie" serves the pattern but edges toward excess; phrases like "conjugated in the present continuous" demonstrate control while risking register elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity ("resonance structures vibrating through her bones"). Some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("ghostly resolve fulfilled, isolation translated"). The piece avoids loops and maintains propulsion, though metaphorical density in action beats creates occasional opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is strong with most lines doing multiple jobs, but repetitive phrasing hurts momentum ("calibrated treason" appears 6 times, "heritage rose thorn" 5 times). Template cadence in middle section ("She'd calibrated... She removed... She began..."). The prose artifacts don't touch closure but create drag.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "echo" that serves the concept. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("webs of intrigue," "luminous threads") and some template cadence in middle sections ("She descended... She stepped forward... She pressed"). The closing image lands cleanly without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with most sentences doing multiple jobs and varied rhythm that breathes with scene needs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("hymn that tasted like salt and forgiveness") occasionally approaches overwriting but remains purposeful. Minor synonym churn around ice/glacier/frozen vocabulary, though mostly justified by the setting's constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments of density ("fireflies drifted like sparks from an invisible forge") alternate with philosophical scaffolding. Some paraphrase loops appear ("to appreciate hidden effort—the unseen labor that keeps villages alive, the invisible threads"), and abstract passages occasionally slow momentum, though the prose achieves lyric coherence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—"clicked like an angry cicada" establishes danger, sound, and atmosphere simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for one instance of elevated diction ("deliberate palimpsest") that doesn't quite fit Marisol's practical voice, and slight opacity in the "reassembled letters, now wet with sap" transition.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose carries strong imagery but suffers from repetitive "through fragmented radio frequencies" (3x identical) and occasional overwriting ("lyrically prophetic," "gritty whimsy"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The incomplete ending undermines closure clarity despite apparent intentionality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"bones humming with the lonesome splendor" establishes both physical state and emotional tenor. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the jar-emptying sequence through shorter, list-like phrases. Minor deduction for occasional overwrought metaphor ("brushed her ribs like a cat asking to be named") that slightly dulls momentum without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative coherence ("sunset bled across the horizon like a wound healing in reverse") with high information density. Some ornamental phrases slow momentum ("fleshly ethereal" appears decoratively), and occasional register elevation doesn't fully match POV lexicon during technical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the moon's single silver eye" establishes setting, tone, and isolation simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully between long observational passages and short declarative moments. Some abstract phrasing ("sculpt patience from impatience") and occasional register elevation detract, though the prose generally maintains strong momentum toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, particularly in the tunnel descent sequence. Information density adequate with most lines advancing multiple purposes. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("controlling influence"/"controlling influences," "memories entangled"/"memories entangled faster"), and some scaffold phrases like "she understood" and "she realized" dull immediacy. Template cadence in middle section with repetitive "She [verb]" openings.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, like "Emil paid with the chapel candle fund, money aptly deliberate, illuminating nothing if not spent on life." Minor repetition of "vibrant hush" and "aptly deliberate" creates pattern but risks becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("cathedral-sized buoy of rusted iron, gears the size of whales"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("irreverent awe made audible"), and minor redundancy in the Algorithm descriptions. Information density is high but sometimes tips toward ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and effective rhythm modulation. Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("rattled like a dying hard drive" mixed with other metaphors) and some template phrasing around the corporate elements that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with purposeful figurative language that serves the fantastical setting. Strong sentence variety and rhythm control. Some moments of elevated diction ("chromatic scale," "reconstitute possibility from refusal") occasionally strain naturalism but don't obscure clarity. No loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "horn folded the air like linen" and "chime thinner than moonlight" demonstrate controlled figurative language. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting appears ("grips reality loosely" repeated four times, abstract phrases like "frozen compass teaching the marina"), and the extended coda creates momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of precise beauty ("tasted what Sarah had known") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "burned love letter edge" (5 mentions) and abstract terms like "passionate subtlety." Some sentences restate rather than advance: "Marcus remained behind as he always did, the lone vineyard sentinel."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though tendency toward complex abstractions occasionally slows momentum ("spaces where truth could manifest without the corruption of worldly noise"). Some repetitive structures ("He walked," "He began," "He pressed"). The mystical vocabulary maintains coherence but occasionally tips into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose occasionally tips into overwriting ("silver halide a scar someone forgot to feel") and some metaphors strain coherence. However, the lyrical density serves the accumulative mode, and key images like "footprints that spelled, in cursive only bees can read" maintain propulsion despite ornate construction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("weight of finality," "suspended hush") and filter constructions ("she felt," "she realized") dull immediacy. The paraphrase loop about growth patterns (inward/folding/return) reduces momentum without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density remains high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, though several passages contain near-paraphrase loops ("fog sculptures shifted...momentary monuments to impermanence" follows similar content). Template cadence appears in the repetitive "He [verb]" constructions mid-story, and some metaphors edge toward purple prose ("bones pointing toward revelation").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves lyric density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The lens faced inward, toward the heart of the station" works literally and metaphorically. Some repetition serves the accumulative pattern ("luminous ache" appears 4 times) but "changelessly constant" variations feel slightly mechanical. Information density high but occasional abstraction ("harness the ephemeral") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears in metaphors like "darkness felt like velvet held underwater" and "monitor's peaks softened into gentle hills." Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions appears 3+ times consecutively. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story but some descriptive passages could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "constellations poured like liquid into the hollow horizon." However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("hearts suddenly heavier with the weight they had unknowingly shed") and some repetitive structure in the ending paragraphs. The metaphor density in peak beats occasionally obscures rather than clarifies action.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("heart a map of bright fractures"), some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy, and density that occasionally obscures action clarity. Information density high but sometimes at clarity's expense.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The mist reacted, coiling tighter, weaving itself into translucent ropes"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("soft petals of luminance unfurling") and occasional register drift ("the exact mass of every night") prevent higher scoring, though no major clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful repetition of "pattern left by drip." Information density is high, though occasional overwriting appears ("vulnerably protected" reverses itself unnecessarily). The "honeyed hush" repetition and some metaphor mixing ("wound...taste like metal...graft") create minor friction without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of precision ("fog funneled into the spiral, polishing its ridges") but suffers from abstract clusters—"swirling hush" appears four times, "ephemeral cameo" twice. Several sentences could be tightened: "lucidly watchful" feels forced as a phrase insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows ambition but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching ("moss-covered branch," "copper goggles reflecting," "verdant arbor"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("when harvest moon's descent, the vine tendril's awakening, and the forgotten songs' return"). Information density is high but sometimes obscures rather than clarifies the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "each thump of her pulse against her ribs was a village waiting to be founded." Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("burnt matches," "silver teeth") enriches rather than obscures. The truncated ending damages technical completion but the gesture remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and plot mechanics). Some figurative density in places ("like cherries dropping in an orchard just beyond the edge of hearing") but it serves the accumulative design. Minor scaffold in repeated "wounded season" phrase and occasional abstract constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagery like "moth wings" for memory sheets and "antler and starlight" loom creates textural specificity. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("auric note rang out, calcifying the air"), and the abstract mystical terminology occasionally impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs - "swept the shavings into a jar labeled 'Manes & Mettle'" advances action while revealing character. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: "sawdust and thunder, hauntingly practical" and multiple "rust-hued peace" iterations create ornamental weight. Template cadence appears in "She would... She traced... She lifted" opening sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative control and information density, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("I am chronologically confused" followed by explanation; "eroded ambitions" then restated as scraped fragments). Template cadence appears in fragment-listing sequence, though overall prose propulsion remains serviceable.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "starlight poured in clean lines" and "brass limbs bent like a bird with a secret." Deductions for occasional overwriting ("yawning mouth," multiple metaphors per sentence in places) and slight template cadence in the middle section's "She [verb]" patterns. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in the transformation sequence. Minor issues include some abstract phrasing ("weight of that arrogance"), occasional filter verb clusters ("feeling," "seeing"), and a few overly complex metaphors ("slower currency of acceptance") that slightly obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density and varied syntax, but "serene upheaval" appears three times creating mild repetition. Some abstract phrasing ("scaffolding she now knew how to dismantle") could be more concrete. The prose generally propels forward with purposeful rhythm shifts between discovery and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rich information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "She planted it then, there, in the thin snow dusting the dock plank, pressing it into the grain with the same reverence a priest plants ashes." Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("accordion," "midwife") but mostly serves the oceanic tone. Minor redundancy in the final paragraph's multiple restatements of continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments like "dried fountain" and "leaves arranged themselves into patterns," but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("she'd," "she realized") and abstract constructions ("lonesome splendor," "extraordinary one"). Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the concept of absence/presence. The final paragraph contains effective imagery but could tighten its recursive explanations.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong sentence-level propulsion with varied rhythm matching scene needs, particularly in the assembly sequence where syntax accelerates. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the egg had been hauled up from the fossil market on a rope of spider silk and debtor promises"). Some figurative density in early sections but coherent and pattern-taught, serving the lyric design rather than obscuring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Some metaphors edge toward strain ("clouds that drifted like kelp in the sky" paired with "kelp-drift peace"), and occasional elevated diction ("unyielding compassion") feels slightly removed from Mara's grounded voice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic variation and purposeful repetition ("defiant hush" bookends effectively). Information density is high with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere. Some figurative density in places ("constellation of regrets," "sidereal patience of stars long dead") without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions that advance both atmosphere and stakes. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("troubling serenity" repeated without variation) and some filter-verb clustering in emotional beats. The final image of "widening spirals" effectively recharges the circular motif.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("monarchs settled on the ribbon until it became a living flag") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Some metaphors feel strained ("widening gyre," "jaw of time"), and the density of figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some middle passages contain mild redundancy ("salt air corrodes certainty" followed by elaboration). The opening and closing images are particularly sharp. Template cadence appears briefly in the "I return/I hear/I remain" sequence but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases ("starlight drips through the skylight"), but several ornamental constructions slow momentum ("As she works, the silo's metal skin picks up distant church bells"). Some filter-heavy passages ("Mercy understands," "she senses") dull immediacy. The multi-clause final sentence maintains control despite complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with vivid imagery, but significant issues: run-on final sentence (190+ words), repetitive "hadn't yet been" constructions, abstract scaffolding ("ignorance cartographer," "sustaining transformation"), and some paraphrase loops around the ignorance/knowledge theme. These artifacts don't obscure closure but significantly impact readability.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some metaphorical density in peak beats ("dust retelling the famine of stories, violins mourning banned epics") risks opacity. Prose maintains momentum but occasional template structures ("She had once...but when...she learned") and compound abstractions slow key passages.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm that matches emotional intensity. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers simultaneously. Minor overwriting appears in metaphor density ("planets around a dying star" following other figurative language) and occasional register elevation, but line-level control remains strong through the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density serves the accumulative design with most sentences carrying multiple functions—the cog is timepiece, archaeological tool, and thematic symbol. Some figurative excess appears ("broken teeth," "ghost heartbeat") but remains controlled. Minor loops occur with "sedimentary layers" and variants of "competing narratives" appearing frequently, though this repetition partially serves the textural accumulation strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but template cadence appears in sequences like "She walked...She returned...She understood." Register drift into abstract philosophizing ("vanishing arts do not disappear; they wait inside negative space") dulls immediacy in places, though the closure image remains vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions—"vines rose fast as clock hands spinning backward" compresses time, motion, and thematic reversal. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("green applause," "stained-glass forgiveness") though patterns cohere. Sentence variety strong; no loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence structures and purposeful compression ("Dawn would bring engineers..."). Information density high throughout with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "nectar dusk" (3x) and some filter verbs ("felt her hair lift") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs—"The ground answered with a low vibration, the same frequency streetlights hum when they daydream" advances plot while reinforcing the animacy theme. Some minor loops appear ("shard of hush" repeated, "creeping normality" echoed) but function as purposeful pattern-teaching. The final incomplete sentence "The orris had taught her that silence could" reads as intentional ellipsis rather than error.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, several instances of figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff ("calcified certainty," "museum of certainties," "suspended silt"). Some template cadence in the middle section with repeated "I [verb]" constructions. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines like "grim optimism of someone who believed the next turn might finally feel different" that advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("velvet-heavy with the texture of almost") but serves the accumulative design. Minor template moments but no loops or scaffolding at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("her insomnia now a lantern"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("soft as pollen," "seed-like") without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in "She realized... She descended... She slept" sequence. Prose generally propulsive with varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves density with images doing multiple jobs ("Steam rose from the oven, mingling with the perpetual mist") though some abstract formulations weaken immediacy ("The displaced persons had not vanished; they had merely gone silent"). Information density is high but occasional conceptual summaries reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "slow exhale of low tide" as structural anchor. Some overwriting in metaphoric density ("dragging the hunger stone like a dying star") and occasional template phrases ("bleak exhilaration" appears 4 times). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though occasional overwriting ("photographically cursed photo booth," "paradoxical notes that rearranged themselves"). Some density issues with figurative language clustering in high-pressure beats. Information density is high and momentum generally sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The tree answered with a low F sharp that traveled through cambium and salt-soaked root." Strong syntactic variety and propulsive rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("restless euphony" appears twice) and slight overwriting in metaphoric density.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the tremor both warns and provides the decoding key). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for one instance of emotional labeling ("dread pooled") and slight overuse of compound adjectives in places.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong imagery ("moonlight on the vines gave enough silver"). The "心跳" artifact and some elevated diction ("sanctioned history," "obsolete dreams") occasionally feel overwrought. Information density is good but a few passages edge toward purple prose. No major loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("boots kissing the wet marble steps that descended into darkness, each footfall echoing like a dropped coin"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("stitching a wound shut with thread made of light") but generally strong propulsion. Occasional abstract phrasing ("interlaced absence") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts, but occasional overwriting ("immaculate conception of knowledge") and some template phrasing ("Hours dripped past"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, though metaphor density in places approaches excess.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The threshold tasted of iron and lullabies" conveys sensory detail, emotional register, and transition simultaneously. Prose propulsion through accumulating images (shadow detaching, stones hovering, dreams leaking) with no loops or scaffolding. The syntactic variety from short declarations ("She chose the southern stair") to complex accumulations maintains rhythm without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful compression, but "intangibly tangible" appears three times creating a minor loop, and phrases like "bleak exhilaration" feel template-driven when repeated. The technical language ("perturbation theory," "quantum telescope") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves good clarity with evocative moments ("stars spilled across its surface—not printed, but moving, dancing, calling"). Several instances of telling over showing ("reading her expression," "reverent fingers") and some repetitive constructions ("She'd been tracking," "She watched," "She descended") create minor drag. No major loops but could compress scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong opening and several vivid lines ("sky bruised itself purple," "lies could shelter barnacles"). However, abstract phrases like "sieved hush" and "granular silence" appear multiple times without full dramatization, creating mild opacity. Some elevated register drift ("fermented," "abrade") that doesn't fully match POV. Information density is generally high but occasional abstraction dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "the mist pressed closer, erasing horizon until only the parapet existed." However, abstract phrases like "futures, not ledgers" and "between apology and forgiveness" occasionally slow momentum, and some metaphors strain ("borrowed bone").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong sentence variety and rhythmic control, particularly in action sequences. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphor density in middle sections ("backlash of regrets began as a cold thread") borders on overwriting but remains coherent. Template cadence appears briefly in "She thought of... she understood now... she smiled because" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong information density and varied rhythm, but several instances of abstract phrasing reduce immediacy: "delicately robust yearning tugged at him" and similar constructions. The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("water glowed like bottled auroras") but occasionally drifts into conceptual abstraction that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the ritual sequences. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("silhouette of ember and memory, crying notes that cracked the night open like a pomegranate") occasionally slows momentum without clear payoff, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("time had begun to pool in strange places—behind the mirror, inside the chimney") but suffers from density overload and abstract constructions. Phrases like "willingly perplexed" and "choking beauty" appear multiple times without earning their opacity. Some metaphors strain coherence (the saucer crack becoming both river and canyon). Information density is high but clarity occasionally sacrificed for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm support the accumulative structure. Information density is high—most sentences advance both literal and symbolic registers. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("archive of redeemed shadows") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pervasive abstract philosophizing creates momentum drag: "transformation's texture," "ultimate emptiness that can be filled with everything," "intersection of giving and receiving." Template cadence appears in repetitive "she [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Information density suffers from paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate transformation concepts without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops appear ("stood unlocked in every sense" restates the prior description). Template cadence emerges in places ("Garnet traced...Garnet answered...Garnet unrolled"). The "winking hush" and "cradle of sparks" phrases risk overuse, though they serve thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("eels swam through sky and stars sang in pockets") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Some metaphorical density without clear payoff ("geometry of absence"). Filter verb clusters in middle section ("he saw," "he knew," "he understood") reduce immediacy. Information density generally high but some conceptual loops around pattern/understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong image-making ("sealed envelope wedged in an old bus timetable like a prayer between rusted hours"). However, several instances of elevated diction strain clarity ("thunder rarefied the air," "furiously tranquil precision") and the incomplete final sentence disrupts closure momentum. Some density overload in metaphor-heavy passages.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong opening with the atrium's dual hums and closing with copper-thread binding. Information density high in descriptive passages. Template cadence appears in philosophical exchange ("She said," "He spoke," pattern) and some synonym churn around "question/paradox/query." Line-level control stronger in physical description than abstract dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("Skin splits at shoulder blades," "flames bloom green, luminous fracture"). Information density high in most passages. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("beauty from anarchy" appears twice) and some filter constructions that could be more immediate ("Lark feels the new personality settling").

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("strategically creative fingers," "tidal arbor above the clouds that rose and fell on slow atmospheric breaths") and some opacity in the film-world mechanics that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the opening establishes character, setting, conflict, and tone simultaneously), though some passages contain ornamental modifiers that slow momentum ("luminous," "empirically whimsical" appear multiple times). The final paragraph's philosophical summary, while thematically apt, shifts from scene to exposition in a way that slightly dulls the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density in most passages, but several instances of elevated register ("tides of remembrance," "rhythmically placid time") create slight distance from the POV's voice. The prose achieves lyric compression effectively, though phrases like "gunwale" and "diacritics" feel unnecessarily precise for this contemplative mode.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits exceptional rhythmic control and high information density, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere. There is minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "forge exhaled a sound like glass cracking under weight of snow"), but the pattern is taught and the payoff justifies the complexity. No loops, scaffold, or clarity-obscuring artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Sentences are rhythmic and varied, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. Figurative language is consistent and purpose-driven, enhancing rather than obscuring sense. A single, minor synonym churn ("illuminated moment" used repeatedly) prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A minor deduction for a single instance of potential register drift ("emotional tectonic shift") which, while apt, momentarily leans toward abstraction in an otherwise impeccably embodied peak beat. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("rusted library groaned like an old prop ship").

    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. A single, minor artifact: the phrase "wordless conversation" is repeated, but this functions as a taught pattern and charged reprise rather than a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly propulsive, with near-zero scaffolding or loops. A minor register drift occurs in "fault circuits," a slightly technical term that feels slightly jarring within the otherwise organic, mythic diction. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with every sentence advancing atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is precise and cohesive ("coal dust communion wafers").

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure without muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Read-aloud ear test is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional ornate phrasing ("strobe around him") that, while voice-motivated, slightly risks clarity. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax that accelerates with pressure. A single minor artifact: "thick as incense yet odorless" slightly restates itself, but this is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation that accelerates with the protagonist's urgency. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Every sentence advances the story. Minor point: the phrase "chronologically homesick" risks feeling like a label, but its concrete embodiment throughout mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is superb, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor deduction for occasional moments of extreme compression that momentarily challenge clarity (e.g., "procedural algorithm hiccupped"). These are few and do not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and poetic, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor figurative muddle in "floral gravity collapsing his chest," which slightly strains the physical metaphor, and a template cadence in the adjacent "He did not want to understand... he wanted the tears..." However, these are hairline slips that do not touch the closure or measurably obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush yet precise, with high information density and clear propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent. A minor deduction for a slight scaffold moment ("Impossible choices, the kind that split communities...") which paraphrases the preceding line, creating a small loop in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("sky still wore the color of old pennies") is consistently inventive and physically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is a minor risk of overwriting in a few phrases ("an infant made of endings"), but the figurative language is coherent and serves the closure effect. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor tendency toward overwriting appears in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "Each footfall paraphrased density: ice became membrane, membrane became mist, mist became chorus"), creating a slight figurative muddle that briefly obscures momentum. This prevents a top-tier score, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. However, a minor flaw prevents a perfect score: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the high-pressure beat describing the memories ("elm crowns shading council fires..."), which creates a brief, list-like effect that slightly muddles the clarity of the vision compared to the sharper, more integrated metaphors elsewhere. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without mixed metaphors or artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally controlled, dense, and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistently sharp and purposeful ("fossilized moonlight," "polymers of memory"). One minor potential artifact: "the ear nested in her chest" is a striking image but could be seen as slightly overwrought. However, it serves the moment and does not obscure sense. Rhythm is masterful, particularly in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor tendency toward dense figurative language in high-pressure beats ("the brass doors exhaled their first official breath") creates a slight risk of opacity, preventing a perfect score. There are no loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues at the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits exceptional rhythmic control and high information density, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "each polyp a tiny mouth whispering stories").

The sentence-level rhythm is masterful, and there are no loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifacting occurs in peak beats with stacked metaphors ("seeds of vigilance... latent blaze... synapses fire in impossible patterns"), creating a slight muddle, but clarity is never fully lost and the closure image lands with stunning force.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor case of overwriting occurs in the peak beat: "how empathy in motion travels from wire to wound to willing heart" has a slightly abstract, diagnostic flavor that briefly interrupts the tactile immersion. This is a hairline slip in an otherwise flawless execution, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts.

No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information is conveyed with concision and momentum; even the reflective block about the mother is anchored in the present action and tilts Myrrh's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. A few phrases in the climax ("rehearsal, countless generations running their survival dance") verge on over-written abstraction, creating a slight muddle in an otherwise clear peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is generally crisp, vivid, and propulsive. Strong information density, with lines often serving multiple functions (character, setting, plot). A brief run of similar sentence structures in the paragraph beginning "She documented wind speeds..." creates a slight rhythmic plateau. Otherwise, excellent control and clarity, with no artifacts muddying the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled with strong rhythmic propulsion. Minor density issues appear in peak beats (e.g., "cathedral whose pillars were frozen chords" slightly stacks metaphor) but clarity and momentum are maintained, and closure is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor deduction for one potential synonym churn ("avalanchingly quiet" repeated) though it serves pattern. No figurative muddle in peak beats. Closure image remains clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.4)

Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.8)
    Prose is flawless, achieving a rare density where every sentence advances multiple layers of story, character, and atmosphere. Rhythm is masterful, varying naturally with the emotional beats. There are zero artifacts, loops, or muddles; the language is pristine, purposeful, and powerful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without muddle: “bruised-azure shadow,” “ore trams,” “gravity-oxen” serve character and world. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent. Sentences advance momentum; no loops or scaffolds. Minor hairline slip: “awakenings yet unpaid” leans slightly abstract, but clarity at closure is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistently purposeful and coherent, though one mixed metaphor ("loom" and "strands" slightly clash with "copper wire of her veins") prevents a perfect score. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A single, minor artifact exists: the phrase "the sound was the feeling of safety trying to fit inside metal" is a rare moment of abstraction that slightly muddles an otherwise concrete peak beat. This prevents a perfect score, but the line-level craft is otherwise flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly wrought but maintains propulsion and clarity. Minor artifact: the phrase "Accidentally prophetic" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. While the prose is richly figurative, it is purposeful and never obscures causality or closure. A minor instance of potential overwriting ("spectral trees that ringed the parapet, their leaves numbered like the astronomer's nightmare") is saved by its pattern being taught and paid off in the closure. The read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling, propelling the narrative forward.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slightly overstacked figurative language in one high-pressure beat ("tarry vines that whipped," "coagulating into tarry vines"). However, the propulsion never stalls, and the closure image remains piercingly clear and un-obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.6)

    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density (e.g., "the sky beyond the glass had turned the color of old copper"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with tension. Minor hairline slip: slight over-reliance on figurative language in peak beats ("tears blurred the ink further, yet the letters did not dissolve") risks mild opacity, but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and utterly precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating with the comet's arrival.

Sentence-level rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating and breathing in perfect step with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor deduction is applied for figurative density in high-pressure beats, such as "petals unfolding backwards, stems exhaling chlorophyll mist," which, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring the causal clarity of the magical mechanics at the climax. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure, which remains crystal clear. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density, though a minor tendency toward ornate phrasing ("calibrated treason") creates a slight register elevation in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight ornate density in phrases like "serpentine nexus under starlight," though it remains voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or character.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. However, slight overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "planetarium of collective sorrow" introduces a mixed metaphor). No loops or scaffolding, but this figurative muddle prevents a 9+ score despite otherwise exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity. Figurative language ("fireflies drifted like sparks from an invisible forge") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Minor deduction: "scintillatingly somber wonder" risks register drift but is quickly anchored by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but generally purposeful, with high information density. Minor overwriting in phrases like "angry cicada" slightly strains metaphor, but clarity and momentum are maintained. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; sentence rhythm supports tension.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the climax ("reverse snowfall," "restrained wildness"), but it remains coherent and does not obscure the closure's clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is consistently strong, vivid, and purposeful, with high information density. A single minor artifact: the phrase "empirical observation becoming tactile" slightly paraphrases the prior idea of hollow numbers without adding new pressure. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary and propels the narrative without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("dust motes floated like slow constellations") is purposeful and coherent.

Figurative language is consistent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for slight figurative density in the opening ("timestamps that pulsed like dying stars") and a near-paraphrase loop ("deleted files never disappear" / "absence, once sensed, leaves a cavity"). However, these do not obscure closure and the line-level propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. One mixed metaphor slightly muddles a peak beat: "muscles burning like lanterns" combines physical sensation and light imagery awkwardly.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and a superb read-aloud rhythm. However, a minor deduction is applied for a tendency toward overwriting and stacked modifiers in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the protected vulnerability of new growth," "honeyed hush thickened"). These moments, while beautiful, slightly blur sense and register a hair above the POV's likely lexicon under peak stress, creating a minor artifact that prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences consistently advance story, character, and atmosphere. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("The swirling hush tightened into a vortex of almost-voices: readers who would never turn the page, characters who would never exhale") which, while beautiful, slightly stacks figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exquisite and densely poetic, with nearly every sentence performing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. There is a minor instance of potential register drift ("time accordion" is a slightly academic metaphor for this POV), but it is a hairline slip that does not harm clarity or momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control.

Momentum is sustained, and the closure image is clear. A single –0.4 deduction for a minor artifact in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exceptional, with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery ("star-shadows," "groaned like a waking beast"). Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with the scene's tempo. A minor prose artifact exists: the phrase "the brilliant dimness of twilight" is slightly redundant ("twilight" implies the dimness), and "brilliant dimness" itself is a near-contradictory metaphor that slightly muddles the sensory clarity at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor tendency toward overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "sieved hush inside her coarsened, becoming something she could grip"), where figurative language stacks slightly and blurs sense. However, clarity and momentum are largely maintained, and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops.

A minor deduction for occasional complex syntax that requires rereading, but momentum is never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly poetic with tremendous information density. A minor deduction for occasional over-densification in high-pressure beats (e.g., "choking beauty; the moonlight tasted of sugared milk gone cold"), which, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring immediate clarity. However, it never harms closure and the rhythm is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor -0.1 deduction for a subtle template cadence in the description of the holograms ("flickered like candlelight over the faces of long-dried photographs") which is slightly decorative. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is lush but highly controlled, with exceptional rhythm and information density. A slight register drift occurs in the peak beat with the phrase "skeleton of light," which feels slightly academic for the POV's lexicon under duress, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "two tongues of the same silent flame") and a template cadence in "Footsteps approached... Footsteps again."

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor risk of overwriting exists in phrases like "shimmering equations written in light," but the figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for a potential figurative stack in "the glass walls shimmered, reflecting their words back as fractured light, dignified chaos made visible," which slightly risks coherence but is ultimately taught and paid off. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are minor artifacts: a slight register drift in the phrase "luminous fracture against iron" feels slightly elevated for the POV, and a few sentences are exceptionally dense, requiring a re-read without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the sky-garden description ("greenhouse of air roots and bonsai pines suspended between cumulus pillows"), which momentarily slows momentum but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a slight tendency toward overwriting and complex metaphor ("empirically whimsical hush") creates minor artifacts that, while voice-motivated, occasionally risk obscuring immediacy. These do not touch the closure, which is rendered with stunning clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is precise and consistent, serving character and atmosphere. There is no evidence of loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in step with the scene's needs.

Occasional density risks purple but remains coherent and propulsive. No loops or scaffold clutter dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line‑level craft is often elegant, with layered images doing double duty; the “’98” tasting line is especially strong. There’s mild overwriting and paraphrase looping around “amber pavilion” and “after the final bus,” and abstract assertions sap compression. The mid‑final thematic sentences lean expository. The final truncation is a line‑level artifact that disrupts cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line work is clean and purposeful; images carry multiple jobs (moon’s indifference, cupped‑hand roof, gears’ memory).

== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—elegant, dense, and propulsive. Every sentence serves a purpose, layering imagery, scientific concepts, and emotional resonance without a single wasted word. Figurative language, such as the comparison of shattered glass to "frost" and dust motes to "galaxies," is both beautiful and thematically coherent. The syntax is varied and the rhythm is controlled, culminating in the powerfully truncated final sentence, a daring and effective stylistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    While the prose is consistently beautiful and rhythmically controlled, it suffers from an over-density of figurative language. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, which, while often striking, can feel relentless and occasionally blurs clarity. A more selective application would allow the most powerful images to land with greater force; the current implementation borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly figurative, with standout lines like "brass rivers, percussion constellations, string nebulae." It maintains momentum and clarity despite its richness, with virtually no wasted words or scaffolding. The language is consistently elevated, which is supported by the high concept, though it occasionally nears the edge of being overly ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and flawlessly executed, with not a wasted word. Figurative language, such as grief being translated into light "the way a prism translates sun into rainbow," is both beautiful and functional, advancing the plot while deepening the atmosphere. The rhythm is hypnotic, mirroring the underwater setting, and the piece is entirely free of scaffolding or line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise language. Sentences like "communion, a relay of silence and sustenance that stitched the generations together" perform multiple functions—advancing plot, defining method, and deepening theme—with seamless economy and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, syntactic variety, and startlingly precise figurative language ("petals drifting like slow fireworks," "lungs rattled like dry seedpods"). There are no prose artifacts, loops, or wasted words; every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the story's emotional state. The prose is the primary engine of the story's success, creating a world that feels both dreamlike and tangibly real.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and vivid, original imagery. However, a few instances of high-register, almost clinical terminology ("retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry," "toroidal waves") create a minor tonal friction against the otherwise organic, sensory language. While not egregious, this slight register drift in moments of high fantasy prevents the prose from achieving absolute seamlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and propelled by a powerful rhythm. Figurative language is inventive and specific, avoiding cliché while enhancing atmosphere ("fear lodging like a popcorn kernel in the teeth of their orders").

The figurative language is not ornamental but core to the POV and the story's magical-realist logic, resulting in a piece with zero scaffolding and powerful momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, original imagery ("a hood the color of wet asphalt," "tears reflecting the moon like spilled mercury"). The prose is ambitious and consistently delivers. The score is capped just shy of the highest marks due to the single continuity slip regarding the time of day ("golden sunset" vs. "moonlight"), a minor flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, precise imagery, and a varied, musical rhythm.

The only significant flaw is a touch of scaffolding in the final paragraph's thematic declarations, which momentarily breaks from the more concrete, image-driven prose that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating masterful control of rhythm, syntax, and figurative language. Every sentence is load-bearing, contributing to atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously.

There is a high information density without feeling overwritten, and a complete absence of scaffolding or cliché, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is consistently elegant and information-dense, with not a wasted word. Figurative language, such as the ticket glowing "like a wound" or the heart drumming "a funeral march for resentment," is evocative and precise. The final sentence about the indifferent city feels slightly less integrated than the powerful beats preceding it, but this is a minor blemish on an otherwise impeccable piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative figurative language ("constellation of broken memories"). The rhythm is controlled and suits the contemplative pace. The primary flaw is a slight shift towards summary in the final paragraphs, where Elara's epiphany is explained rather than purely experienced through image and action. This prevents a perfect score, but the overall craft remains at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, characterized by high information density and striking, original figurative language ("moved like chilled honey," "unfurl like a paper fan"). Sentences are crafted with a strong rhythmic awareness, and there are no wasted words or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled, with strong sensory details. The primary flaw is a degree of conceptual redundancy in the final third. Key thematic ideas are re-stated in slightly different phrasing across several paragraphs (e.g., the power of "between-spaces," the "unsung" being heard), which reads like scaffolding and slightly dulls the propulsive clarity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly ambitious, yet it remains clear and purposeful throughout. Figurative language is not ornamental; it does the primary work of building atmosphere and escalating internal conflict. Sentences are constructed with rhythmic precision, and there are no instances of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts. The language achieves a rare synthesis of beauty and function, where the texture of the prose is inseparable from the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, varied sentence rhythms, and stunningly original figurative language ("eyes like caliper marks," "pneumatic memory").

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by startlingly original and coherent figurative language ("spine cracked open like a scream that had decided to stay").

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with muscular verbs and startling, precise imagery ("white explosions that looked like negatives developing in a tray"). However, the figurative density is relentless, occasionally bordering on overwriting; nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile. While the quality of the figures is high, a more varied rhythm with moments of plainer statement could heighten the impact of the most crucial images. There are no technical flaws, but the sheer richness slightly mutes its own peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language.

Figurative language is not ornamental but fundamental to the world-building, as in "temporal papercuts" and wounds that "leak hours instead of blood." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence drives the narrative forward with both clarity and a powerful, unique rhythm. This is line-level craft of a publishable, award-worthy standard.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density and exquisite sensory detail. Word choice is consistently strong, and the sentence-level rhythm propels the quiet narrative forward with grace.

The craftsmanship is nearly flawless, creating a piece that feels both polished and deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, with strong verbs and concrete imagery carrying the narrative forward. The sentence structure varies to match the pacing of Elara's discovery and flight.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and displays exceptional sentence-level craft. Figurative language is fresh and precise (“bloomed like a bruise,” “detachment...lay folded beside her like a discarded coat”). There are no wasted words; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or the internal plot. The rhythm and syntax shift in lockstep with Lira’s emotional state, demonstrating a high level of authorial control without a single discernible artifact or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and precise for most of the story, with sharp, evocative imagery. There is a slight drift toward abstraction in the final paragraphs, with phrases like "whimsical certificate of unpaid debts" and "cautious exuberance sealed with a smile no spreadsheet could audit." While fitting the voice, this minor increase in conceptual density slightly softens the landing after the concrete, powerful action of giving away the locket.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and often breathtaking, with high information density and evocative figurative language. However, the prose occasionally tips from lush into overwrought, particularly during climactic moments where the density of metaphor slightly clouds the action. While free of mechanical flaws like loops or scaffolding, a more restrained hand in key beats would have allowed the powerful images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, precise, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language is consistently inventive and functional, as with the "breadcrumb of sound" or "tiny boats of digits." There are no wasted words, scaffold phrases, or textual artifacts; every sentence serves to build the world, advance the emotional arc, or deepen the atmosphere with remarkable efficiency and beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Word choice is precise and evocative, and sentence structures are varied to create a compelling rhythm. While the figurative language is consistently rich, it occasionally borders on being overwritten (e.g., "tectonic plates of turquoise memory"), a hairline slip in an otherwise flawless performance. However, every sentence serves to advance atmosphere, character, or action, achieving remarkable information density without any discernible padding, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.6)

The writing avoids significant loops or scaffolding, maintaining momentum and clarity even during the most complex moments of the metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely excellent, with strong verbs and precise, memorable imagery ("monastery... like a broken tooth"). The rhythm is controlled, slowing for reflection and quickening with Mara's feverish painting. The primary flaw is a minor but noticeable prose artifact: the repetition of "wryly earnest." While it connects the characters thematically, on the line level it reads like a reused block of text, a slight scaffold that momentarily breaks the unique texture of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and demonstrates a high level of craft with varied syntax and precise, evocative word choice. While the language is consistently rich and verges on the ornate ("the thin membrane of the moment"), it remains coherent and serves the story's heightened, magical atmosphere without tipping into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest literary quality, exhibiting exceptional information density and rhythmic control. The extended metaphor of language and text is sustained brilliantly without ever feeling strained, from the "page left blank" harbor to the "apostrophes" of boots. Every sentence is load-bearing, propelling the narrative while deepening the atmosphere. It is a flawless execution of line-level craft, with zero artifacts or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Figurative language is inventive and purposeful, as in "punching holes in memories he had stapled shut."

There are no wasted words or technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is consistently luminous, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. While the figurative language is exceptionally dense, it serves the story's central metaphor of an “unheard symphony” and thus feels patterned and purposeful rather than overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating both high information density and poetic grace.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, precise, and evocative, with every sentence contributing to momentum and atmosphere. The figurative language is consistently strong and integrated, particularly in phrases like "granite policies into negotiable vapor" and "convictions hardened again inside his skull, this time pointing inward like shrapnel." There are no wasted words or scaffolding. The final detail of addressing the envelope "in her own blood" is a slight melodramatic flourish in an otherwise subtle piece, a hairline imperfection that slightly lowers the score from the highest possible peak.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating high information density and syntactic variety without a single misstep into overwriting. Figurative language is consistently original and effective, such as "dawn brightened like paper held to candle."

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, striking metaphors (“bruised sky,” “half-dug coffin”), and propulsive syntax. The language is ambitious and consistently achieves its aims without slipping into pure ornament. There are no discernible loops or scaffolding; every sentence serves to deepen character, atmosphere, or the story's central inquiry, culminating in a final paragraph that lands with precision and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality, characterized by information density, striking figurative language, and powerful rhythm. Lines like "keep the dark from remembering land prices" are exceptional. However, the story is marred by a single, jarring line-level artifact: "flickering across their faces like投射的火花." This untranslated fragment breaks the immersion at a key moment. While the surrounding prose is nearly flawless, this error prevents a score in the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with nearly every sentence performing multiple functions—advancing plot, deepening character, and enriching atmosphere. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, creating a momentum that feels both inexorable and contemplative. A few figurative constructions, such as "bioluminescent regret," verge on being overwrought, slightly marring an otherwise flawless execution by ascribing complex human emotion where a more concrete physical description might have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=10.0)
    The line-level craft is immaculate. The prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive, with no wasted words or overwrought descriptions. Word choice is precise ("lumen-veins," "singing spectra"), and sentence rhythm is controlled to match the story's tension and moments of calm. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; it is polished to publishable perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, lyrical, and precise, with zero overwriting or scaffolding. Every sentence serves a purpose, from the evocative opening ("shattered mirror," "sky too calm for comfort") to the technically sharp descriptions ("walls ribbed like throat cartilage"). The information density is superb, conveying character, setting, and plot advancement simultaneously in lines like "leaving the furnace to sigh itself cold." The read-aloud quality is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exceptional, characterized by high-density, evocative imagery and a varied, musical rhythm. Figurative language is inventive and precise ("the way moonlight tastes on the tongue of a sleepwalker"). The piece is nearly flawless at the line level, with the only minor issue being the final sentence, which shifts into a slightly more abstract, explanatory register that feels less immediate than the prose preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and evocative, demonstrating high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, consistently reinforcing the story's core concepts and atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The final sentence leans slightly into abstraction, but the craft is otherwise impeccable, with no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding to dull the story's sharp momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and highly polished, with very few wasted words. Figurative language is inventive and consistent, creating a cohesive and immersive texture ("copper dusk settling on his shoulders like a verdict"). While the style is elevated, it rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story's fabulist atmosphere. The final sentence—"Behind him, the lighthouse folded"—is a testament to the power of concision and a perfectly executed final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and almost flawless. Word choices like "leaden," "grafting whip," and "ephemeral cameo" are precise and potent. The piece demonstrates high information density and sentence-level propulsion, with no discernible loops or scaffolding. A few phrases lean towards the ornate ("banner of mournful elation"), but they remain consistent within the elevated, gothic tone and do not detract from clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with striking and effective figurative language. However, a few phrases read as slightly too direct an echo of the story's core concepts, such as "bleeding hauntingly optimistic red" and muttering couplets that "rhymed ruin with reverence." While minor, these moments momentarily thin the veil of the narrative. Otherwise, the line-level craft is pristine, with no artifacts, strong propulsion, and excellent syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and meticulously crafted, with very few wasted words. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, as in "iron gates hung open like a reluctant mouth" and "cautious enchantment thick as honey."

There are no notable loops or artifacts; the high density is earned and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lyrical and image-rich, with many standout phrases. However, its relentless density of figurative language occasionally feels overwritten, threatening to slow the momentum, particularly in moments of high tension. The repetition of the phrase "carefully inventive" is a minor but noticeable oversight. While beautiful, the line-level craft could benefit from slightly more concision to allow the strongest images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and rhythmic propulsion. Sentences frequently perform multiple functions, weaving character, setting, and plot together, as in the opening line. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The figurative language is fresh and thematically coherent, such as the conspiracy "unraveling across the dome ceiling like a confession."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and precise. While rich with figurative language, it avoids overwriting by ensuring every image serves character and advances the emotional state. The sentences have a varied, hypnotic rhythm that supports the dreamlike journey. The choice to make the climactic line of dialogue starkly simple ("I'm sorry") demonstrates exceptional control, allowing the surrounding imagery to carry the magical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is of an extremely high caliber, marked by information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is rich and purposeful, with images like "anesthetic hummed through my veins like distant shelling" anchoring the reader immediately. While the density of metaphor is high, it feels voice-motivated by the narrator's altered state and rarely slips into overwriting. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating a confident and polished line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is consistently luminous and inventive, with high information density in every line.

There are no loops or scaffolding; the line-level craft is impeccable, demonstrating a rare fusion of poetic sensibility and narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and energetic, with high information density and striking figurative language. While mostly successful, the density of metaphors occasionally borders on overwriting in peak moments, such as “defiance fertilized by risk.” This is a hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar performance, preventing a 9+ score due to the slight figurative muddle but still demonstrating exceptional craft and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, imagistic, and demonstrates exceptional control. While lavish, the figurative language consistently serves the story's accumulative momentum and atmosphere without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity. The sentences are rhythmically varied, and the information density is high; nearly every line contributes to character, world, and theme simultaneously. There are no discernible loops, scaffolding, or line-level artifacts to dilute the impact of the powerful closure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and a poetic cadence that never falters. Figurative language is rich and inventive ("cities of uncried tears," "lectern carved from fossilized sighs") but remains coherent and purposeful, building atmosphere rather than obscuring meaning. The sentences are varied and propelled by strong verbs, and there are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding. It is a rare example of elevated, literary prose sustained with perfect control.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly polished, with striking and original figurative language ("each book a coffin of sound"). Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to control pace effectively, building from contemplative exploration to a crescendo. The writing is almost entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, demonstrating a high degree of line-level craft and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and evocative, original figurative language that rarely feels overwritten. Sentences are propulsive and rhythmically varied. Intentional repetitions, such as “slyly heartfelt” and “dappled resolve,” are used to create powerful resonance between character, setting, and theme, demonstrating masterful control. The prose is clean, clear, and carries the story’s weight effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten. The phrase "learning to trust again across learning to trust again" is an awkward loop. The high density of figurative language, while generally effective, sometimes feels stacked, threatening to obscure rather than illuminate the action. These are minor but noticeable artifacts in an otherwise masterful performance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently elegant and inventive, with a high density of fresh, striking images. Syntax and rhythm create a compelling, hypnotic momentum. The piece slightly verges on overwriting due to the sheer density of its figurative language, and the final paragraphs engage in some conceptual restatement, but the line-level craft remains very strong and avoids any significant technical flaws or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking imagery, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft and rhythmic control. Nearly every sentence serves multiple functions. The score is held just below the 9-band due to a few moments where figurative language becomes slightly overwrought, such as the slightly dissonant simile "spotting the first fireflies of summer," which briefly pulls the reader out of the deeply submerged setting.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and ambitious, with high information density. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable repetition. The word "transliterate" is overused, and several core thematic ideas are restated in slightly different phrasing across paragraphs, creating subtle paraphrase loops that dull the momentum. While a stylistic choice, this repetition verges on a prose artifact that holds the craft back from true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and specific imagery. The opening sentence is a perfect example of its high quality. A few phrases, such as "a frequency she had calculated to feel like heartbreak," lean slightly into telling the emotional effect rather than purely showing it. However, these are minor slips in an otherwise polished and rhythmically controlled piece that demonstrates exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates superb line-level craft. While highly figurative, the language remains precise and purposeful, avoiding ornamentalism. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to control momentum, accelerating during the dance and pausing for the final, silent revelation. There are no technical flaws, loops, or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is strong and consistent with the story’s world, such as storms sliding off panes "like apologies." A few phrases verge on being slightly overwritten ("latent auroral residue still folded in the upper atmosphere"), but the overall effect is controlled and powerful, with no text artifacts or loops to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and surgically precise. Figurative language is consistently brilliant and purposeful, as in "fire writes in verbs too quick to read" or "a thin blade of mercy." There are no wasted words, no syntactic loops, and the rhythm of the sentences expertly modulates the story's emotional intensity. This is flawless line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is frequently stunning, with inventive, concise imagery. However, a few minor but noticeable artifacts hold it back from perfection. The verbatim repetition of the phrase "creating patterns with decorations" in two key places feels like a scaffolding remnant rather than an intentional refrain. This loop, though small, slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive, with nearly every sentence doing double duty for plot and atmosphere. Figurative language, such as the negative strip "curled like a sleeping serpent," is consistently fresh and integrated. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the line-level execution is clean and powerful, carrying the story's conceptual weight effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with high information density and precise imagery. However, a few moments dip into slightly overwrought conceptual language (e.g., "...a third rhythm that belonged to neither her nor the child but to possibility itself"). This minor tendency toward abstraction prevents an otherwise flawless performance from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often elegant, the prose is marked by conspicuous repetition of key phrases ("ebony clipboard," "celestial dance," "ritual significance," "redemption's price"). This pattern feels less like a deliberate motif and more like a stylistic artifact, slightly undermining the story's organic feel. These loops, while thematically relevant, create a somewhat mechanical cadence that a final polish would need to address.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rich with striking, memorable images ("shattered mirror," "melody that cracked the air like ice"). However, the final third contains some conceptual redundancy, restating the central paradox of destructive preservation multiple times in similar terms, which slightly dulls the impact. The most significant flaw is the incomplete final sentence ("and found they'd released"), a disruptive artifact that clips the story's resonant closure at the last moment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and a rhythmic cadence that supports the story's ritualistic momentum. While lushly figurative, the language avoids muddle; each metaphor serves to deepen the "bodily poetic" atmosphere. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a polished, propulsive, and impactful read from the opening line to the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong, resonant images like "smoke curl into equations of regret." However, there's a recurring tendency towards lyrical density that can feel slightly overwritten, and key phrases ("meteor hush," "uncommonly serene") are repeated to the point of losing some power. The final paragraphs become more declarative than imagistic, a stylistic shift that slightly weakens the otherwise potent craft.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exquisite, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Phrasing like "a casualty of time's mechanical hunger" and "a wire cathedral wrapped in wings and stories" is evocative without feeling overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and exceptionally precise, with nearly every sentence performing multiple functions. Figurative language is consistently striking and purposeful ("dust floated like pale constellations," "shadowed corridors"). There is no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony; the rhythm of the sentences ebbs and flows with the character's internal state, accelerating into the sanctum and settling into a timeless stillness at the end. It is a masterful display of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, with high information density and rhythmic control (“juice running like forgotten rivers down her chin”). The language demonstrates precision and ambition. The score is held just below the highest tier due to a few instances of abstract, slightly academic phrasing (“metabolize into the same carbon”) that momentarily disrupts the otherwise embodied and sensory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional command of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are dense with meaning, doing multiple jobs at once to build character, setting, and theme without wasted words ("a brass skeleton of angles and dreams"). There are no discernible loops or scaffolding. A demanding editor might find one or two similes slightly familiar ("shimmered like powdered glass"), but this is a hairline critique in an otherwise stellar performance of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and demonstrates exceptional craft, with strong verbs and varied syntax creating a propulsive rhythm. Each sentence is packed with meaning and imagery. The figurative language is ambitious and mostly successful, though its sheer density occasionally verges on being overwritten, as with "infant leaves unfurling like green applause." This is a hairline flaw in what is otherwise masterfully executed prose.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and fresh, evocative imagery like "sunlight on a scalpel" and "flames neon pink, the color of correction fluid." The prose is nearly flawless until the very last line. The final, abrupt sentence fragment is a significant technical error that disrupts the story's rhythm and cadence, leaving the conclusion feeling unpolished and detracting from an otherwise masterful performance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and startlingly original figurative language that serves the story's logic (e.g., a man "suspended in a crystal paragraph").

The syntax is varied and elegant, and the word choice is consistently precise and evocative, resulting in a piece of prose that is both beautiful and ruthlessly efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are occasional moments where the figurative language becomes slightly dense, verging on overwriting (e.g., "confusion and clarity rotate like twin suns"). While beautiful, these instances momentarily prioritize poetic flourish over momentum, representing a hairline fracture in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.3)

This is prose of the highest caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with vivid, concrete imagery in the opening and middle sections. There is a slight shift toward more abstract language in the final paragraphs, which, while thematically coherent, loses some of the line-level propulsion of the earlier prose. Overall, the piece is very clean, with varied syntax and high information density, free of any significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense with purpose, particularly in its imagery ("starlight filtered through the collapsed roof like frozen tears").

There are no loops, scaffold, or prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly figurative, demonstrating superb line-level control. The repetition of "eloquently silent" is a successful, deliberate motif. Sentences like "each rotation a generation, each click a crown hitting flagstones" show remarkable propulsion and information density. A few phrases, like "pale mud on pale cheeks," are slightly less polished than their surroundings, but this is a minor blemish on an otherwise stellar piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and rhythmically complex for 99% of the story. However, the piece ends on an incomplete sentence fragment ("Then he planted it in the cuff of his"). This is a catastrophic line-level failure at the story's most crucial moment, breaking the final image and rendering the climactic action ambiguous. Such a flaw in a pivotal beat is disqualifying for a top-tier publication without revision.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating exceptional rhythm, precision, and information density. Figurative language, such as "paper yield like old scab" and "sunrise over a battlefield," is consistently fresh, evocative, and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and propelled by a strong internal rhythm; there are no wasted words or scaffold phrases. Figurative language, such as "the chill climb his ribs like a ladder of mercury" and "leaves like green snow," is both original and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly effective, with a strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Word choice is precise and evocative. There are no loops or significant redundancies. A minor weakness is the occasional phrase that feels slightly overwrought, such as "factually mystical," which verges on being a label rather than an embodied description. However, this is a very small blemish on an otherwise impeccably crafted piece of prose.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, precise, and breathtakingly lyrical. Figurative language is consistently fresh and powerful, from the "ribs of dawn" to a giggle "writhing like a minnow in air."

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its imagery. Lines like "gears began to breathe, exhaling notes long held hostage" are both beautiful and functional. A very minor deduction for the phrase "offered his unvarnished self as lubricant," where the metaphor feels slightly mechanical and clashes with the more organic, resonant imagery surrounding it, but this is a tiny flaw in an otherwise stellar piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and surgically precise.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense with evocative imagery and demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and highly crafted, marked by high information density and striking, specific imagery ("gears made of seaweed," "paper crane fossilized in salt"). Its rhythm and precision are superb. The score is held just below the 9+ threshold by a few moments where the prose leans slightly into abstraction or thematic explanation, such as the line about unfinished blueprints, which briefly summarizes an idea the story is already showing beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft. Figurative language, such as the greenhouse glass quivering "like a tuning fork" and the city's grief settling into the garden, is both beautiful and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imaginative, with high information density in its imagery ("keep the silence from rusting"). However, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwriting, with some sentences feeling more constructed for beauty than for raw, propulsive storytelling. While there are no technical errors or lazy constructions, a slightly more restrained hand in key moments could have increased its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is exquisite, with high-density sentences and evocative, original metaphors that consistently serve the story's aims. While the figurative language is exceptionally rich, it rarely feels overwritten, maintaining propulsion and clarity even at its most poetic. The intentional repetition of "tranquilly perceptive" works as a successful refrain, anchoring both character and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is the story's most outstanding feature: dense, precise, and highly original. Figurative language is consistently brilliant and integrated, as in "green wheat like an unabridged novel" or time tasting "of iron, like blood from a bitten minute."

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, varied sentence structure, and precise, evocative word choice. While the prose is consistently beautiful, its sheer density of figurative language borders on being overwritten, with metaphors appearing in nearly every sentence. This relentless richness, while a valid stylistic choice, slightly fatigues the ear and keeps the prose from the absolute highest tier of focused impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is luminous and impeccably controlled. Sentences are dense with meaning, combining concrete sensory detail with conceptual depth (e.g., "the slow pulse of sap within," "his own architecture of cells collapsed"). Figurative language is fresh and precise, enhancing rather than obscuring meaning. The rhythm is measured and deliberate, perfectly matching the "gently systematic" pacing of Mateo's work and the slow time of the orchard itself. There are no wasted words or line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with evocative language that builds a powerful atmosphere ("rainwashed tower," "constellation of marks"). The rhythm is well-paced, creating a sense of deliberate investigation. A few instances of abstract phrasing ("maximum emotional resonance") and a slightly circular sentence ("Mara understood that understanding...") represent minor slips that keep the line-level craft just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, dense with startling and beautiful figures of speech (“spoke dead languages the way fishermen speak storms,” “purple throats open to the sky like surprised mouths”).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density, varied syntax, and stunningly precise figurative language ("spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise"). The prose is propulsive and clear despite its poetic density. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency toward abstraction in the final paragraph, which restates the theme. This doesn't rise to the level of a major artifact but prevents a perfect score by momentarily prioritizing summary over image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Lines like “his heartbeat stretched into whale song” and “the corridor folded like paper” demonstrate a rare fusion of precision and poetry. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, achieving a high information density where every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense and highly metaphorical, a high-risk style that succeeds due to its precision and internal consistency ("bruised glass," "torn moonlight").

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    For the most part, the prose is evocative and polished, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, the story is marred by a critical error in its final line, which is incomplete. This flaw fundamentally undermines the momentum and clarity of the resolution at the precise moment it should land, a significant issue that would prevent immediate publication despite the overall quality of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly imagistic, demonstrating superb line-level craft ("knuckles blanched," "predatory in its clarity"). Sentences are rhythmically varied and carry a high information density without feeling overwritten. The piece avoids cliché and maintains momentum throughout. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraph, where the language becomes slightly more abstract and less propelled by concrete imagery as it moves to state the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality—dense, evocative, and precise. Figurative language is consistently striking and purposeful, such as the spire being "a needle stitching sky to stone."

While the metaphorical density is high, it feels purposeful and integral to the story's magical-realist mode rather than ornamental, achieving clarity and momentum without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is luminous, with high information density and striking, original metaphors ("lightning calligraphy," "moonlit bones"). However, the provided text ends with a critically incomplete sentence ("...the only feelings I catch are those the orchard has already"), which fundamentally damages the final line's impact and craft. This is a significant mechanical flaw at the most crucial moment, warranting a substantial deduction from an otherwise near-perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, rhythmic, and propelled by strong, specific verbs and evocative figurative language. The high density of metaphor is sustained by the story's magical-realist register, feeling integral rather than overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often lands with beautiful, precise imagery ("voice cracking like cooling magma"). The sentence structure is varied and the rhythm is controlled. The piece is held back from a higher score by moments of slight overwriting, where abstract, conceptual language ("The palette of resolve shifted inside him") is used to describe an internal state, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp and concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is of the highest caliber. The prose is dense with striking, precise imagery ("sparks write brief constellations," "snowflakes landed like white ink") yet remains clear and propulsive.

Every sentence is dense with meaning and imagery, demonstrating both precision and lyrical power without a single misstep. Metaphors are fresh, coherent, and build upon one another to create a seamless conceptual tapestry, achieving a rare fusion of style and substance that is immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level prose is elegant, with a controlled rhythm and vivid imagery. However, the story suffers from a significant structural artifact: conceptual looping. The central theme of "what clocks truly measure" is paraphrased and restated four separate times, which dulls the impact of the final revelation and reads like authorial scaffolding. While individual sentences are well-crafted, this repetition at a conceptual level weighs down the narrative momentum, particularly at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and exceptionally precise. Information is delivered with remarkable economy, where single sentences often advance plot, character, and world simultaneously. Word choice is consistently strong, and the figurative language, like the "quiet wildfire" of intuition, is both beautiful and perfectly integrated. The opening and closing lines provide a powerful, symmetrical frame, demonstrating a masterful control of craft from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is elegant and precise for the most part, with high information density and strong, evocative sentences ("The tunnel walls were tattooed with more scrawls, equations that solved for regret, love letters to bankruptcy"). The rhythm is controlled, creating a moody, propulsive momentum. A few phrases like "clover melancholy" or "lucid contradictions made flesh" feel slightly overwrought, a small step into abstraction where the rest of the story is so concrete. It's very strong work, but these minor instances of lyrical strain prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density and precise, evocative imagery. Sentence structure and rhythm are expertly varied to match the story's emotional cadence, creating a propulsive yet lyrical momentum.

Every sentence serves a purpose, advancing the story with a confident, lyrical momentum. The line-level craft is impeccable, with varied sentence structures and a rhythm that modulates perfectly with the scene’s emotional tenor. There are no overwriting artifacts or loops; the language is both highly stylized and exceptionally clear, demonstrating a rare level of control.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptional, operating at an extremely high level of craft. Every sentence is dense with meaning and sensory information, yet the momentum never flags. The figurative language is original, consistent, and breathtakingly effective ("syllables sinking through pores like warm ink," "Braille of sound"). There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought passages; it is a masterclass in concision and poetic force.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality, marked by lyrical precision and high information density. The rhythm is controlled and varied, supporting the contemplative and then transcendent mood. While the figurative language is dense, it rarely feels muddled and successfully avoids clichés or scaffolding, resulting in a piece where nearly every sentence contributes to atmosphere and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it is hampered by overwriting and repetition. The phrase "volcanic tenderness" is used three times, creating a noticeable loop that diminishes its impact. The final paragraphs also engage in conceptual redundancy, rephrasing the central theme multiple times, which slows the momentum of the otherwise powerful ending. These artifacts prevent the prose from achieving the clean propulsion required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, beautiful, and highly effective, with a varied rhythm and high information density. The figurative language is lush and, for the most part, serves the story's accumulative drive without becoming overwrought. A few phrases like "auroral sorrow" or "grief that knew it was beautiful" tread close to being overly poetic, but the overall control is strong enough to carry this elevated register. The piece is impeccably clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding to dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and highly efficient, establishing atmosphere and character with precise word choices.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking, original metaphors ("the sublittoral fringe shimmered like a bruise," "cliffs dripping like fresh paint"). The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative forward with a dreamlike momentum. While the sheer density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwritten, it never breaks clarity or coherence and ultimately serves the story's fabulist tone.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, rhythmic, and consistently striking. Every sentence carries weight, advancing the story's atmosphere and thematic depth without a single wasted word or overwrought image.

Each sentence feels purposeful, advancing the textural accumulation of the central event. There are no discernible loops or scaffolding; the writing is clean, confident, and highly polished.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious, with many striking and original images. However, it is weakened by a shift from concrete scene-work to abstract summary in the final paragraphs, which stalls momentum at a crucial point. Phrases like "a living gallery that proved beauty wasn't found in perfection" are prose artifacts that tell rather than show, and this proximity to the closure dulls its impact. The piece sacrifices immediacy for explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from conceptual repetition and scaffolding in the final third. The repeated use of "powerfully gentle" and the multiple summary statements in the closing paragraphs create a loop that explains the theme rather than letting it resonate. This redundancy slightly dulls the propulsion of an otherwise sharp and imagistic piece.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery. However, there is a recurring tendency to use abstract nouns and conceptual labels where concrete actions would suffice (e.g., "illuminate the truth she had discovered," "fragments of the lesson she had learned"). This intellectualizing impulse, particularly in the final paragraph, creates a slight distance and dulls the immediacy of the character's emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is executed at an exceptionally high level, marked by rhythmic variety, high information density, and stunning figurative language that feels earned and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and a controlled, poetic rhythm. Figurative language is ambitious and consistently effective, building the story's unique atmosphere without becoming overwrought or sacrificing clarity. There are no notable line-level artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every sentence serves a clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and resonant figurative language ("vertebrae of a promise"). The prose is clean and propulsive. The score is lowered due to the critical factual error originating at the line level—the contradiction between "five small bodies" and "six ivory fragments"—which introduces a logical flaw that propagates up to the plot level.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, startlingly original figurative language ("each brown rim a vertebra in the spine of memory"), and a complete absence of scaffolding or prose artifacts.

The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, and even in its most lyrical moments, it maintains clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exquisite, with a high density of vivid, original metaphors that consistently serve the story's tone and theme ("a migraine of unborn constellations," "rewriting... on the vacuum itself"). The rhythm is hypnotic and controlled, accelerating and slowing with the narrative tension. While the density of figurative language verges on overwriting, it remains coherent and purposeful, creating a powerful, immersive texture. A few phrases ("chalk and forfeited dreams") are slightly less fresh than their surroundings, but this is a minor flaw in a work of exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional information density and syntactic variety, with each sentence advancing the story's accumulative purpose. Figurative language is bold and consistent with the world's logic ("time unzipping along its seam"). While incredibly dense, the prose avoids overwriting by ensuring every image serves a narrative or atmospheric function, resulting in a piece with zero scaffolding and powerful line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is ambitious, lyrical, and demonstrates immense control of rhythm and image, achieving a rare density without significant loss of momentum. Nearly every line serves multiple functions. The style is a high-wire act of sustained metaphor that almost entirely succeeds, though a few phrases, like "translocates during sleep rules into daylight fact," approach a level of abstraction that momentarily hinders propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often evocative, but it is seriously hampered by two key flaws. First, there are multiple paraphrase loops around the core theme of "unused courage," restating the same idea in slightly different terms, which dulls momentum. More critically, the story ends with an incomplete sentence fragment ("...wisdom that"), a significant technical error that breaks the final cadence and leaves the narrative hanging, undermining the otherwise resolved feeling of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and precise, evocative language. Phrases like "seraphically mundane" and "stitched silence into flesh" are both original and thematically resonant.

The rhythm is controlled and poetic, earning its emotional weight without a single misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently stunning, marked by inventive metaphors and a powerful rhythm. However, at peak moments, the sheer density of figurative language can feel overwrought, slightly impeding momentum rather than enhancing it. A touch more restraint in the busiest sentences would have elevated the prose from excellent to flawless, as it occasionally sacrifices propulsion for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative, precise language ("fish weaving bright alphabets," "cartographic skin"). The prose is rhythmic and clear, propelling the narrative forward without a single wasted word or clunky construction. While dense with figurative language, it rarely feels overwritten and consistently serves character and atmosphere without obscuring the action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with muscular verbs and evocative, specific imagery ("soles tasting the dust," "dumb metal flowers"). However, the figurative language is so dense that it occasionally verges on being overwritten, with a few images feeling more decorative than functional ("peppercorns flung into blue soup"). While the overall effect is powerful, a touch more restraint in key moments would have elevated the craft from excellent to flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, precise imagery. Sentences are constructed for maximum impact, propelling the narrative forward while simultaneously building atmosphere and character.

There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance the story's emotional and atmospheric pressure. The prose is clear and propulsive, achieving a poetic quality without ever sacrificing clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("lunar features dripped like wax into The Tower"). However, its relentless figurativeness occasionally risks becoming overwrought, and a few lines feel like scaffolding that explains the theme rather than dramatizing it. The repetition of "questions rhetorical questions" is a bold stylistic choice that mostly works, but a lighter touch would have elevated the prose from very strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, confident, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its descriptions of the ink and drone. The rhythm is well-paced, building momentum toward the climax without overwriting or syntactic monotony. While largely excellent, a few instances of telling, like the direct statement of his anger transforming to acceptance, slightly blunt the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("exhalations became falling snow that melted on live copper"). However, it occasionally strains under the weight of its own figurative language, creating a density that borders on overwriting. The repetition of the phrase "the blink that follows surprise," while thematically resonant, feels slightly self-conscious and could have been handled with more variation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and precise imagery ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet"). However, there are minor instances of abstraction and repetition that create slight drag. The phrase "inculcating plants with values" appears twice and reads like a conceptual label rather than an organic description, and the final paragraphs engage in some thematic paraphrase-looping, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and impeccably crafted, with a high information density where every image serves character, atmosphere, or plot. While rich with figurative language, it avoids overwriting; the metaphors are coherent and escalate the stakes, particularly in the description of the goddess. The sentence structure is varied, creating a powerful rhythm, and there are no textual artifacts like loops or scaffolding. The final line powerfully reprises the initial "net" motif, demonstrating a sophisticated control of language and structure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences are crafted with care and rhythm. A minor penalty is applied for a few instances where the language drifts from embodied action into abstract summary at key moments, such as the phrase “constructing empathy’s armor,” which momentarily flattens the otherwise sharp and concrete prose.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is the story's most stellar achievement—dense, musical, and consistently inventive. Every line carries weight, blending sensory detail with emotional resonance without a single misstep or overwrought phrase. The figurative language is both original and coherent, establishing the story's unique physics, as seen in the line: "she had tasted starlight while dabbing silver paint, and the coin still hummed with that forbidden flavor."

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is largely fluid and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it is weakened by a few noticeable artifacts at key moments. The phrase "willowglass hope" is overwrought, and the line summarizing Maya's motivational shift is an instance of telling that undermines a critical beat. These slips, combined with the mechanical error in the final sentence, detract from an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense with evocative, original imagery ("salt-curtains," "thermal glyphs," "a seed of pure resonance") yet remains clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is luminous and dense with startlingly original figurative language (“currents rearranged like ink drying on parchment”). There is, however, a minor artifact in the repetition of "percolate through ambient awareness," which feels slightly less organic than the surrounding prose and hints at an external constraint. This small redundancy is the only blemish on an otherwise flawless and propulsive line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and striking, original metaphors. While the prose is consistently lush, it rarely feels overwritten, as the figurative language almost always serves to deepen character or atmosphere. There is a minor loss of propulsion in the final two paragraphs, which shift slightly from dramatization to reflective summary, but this is a small flaw in an otherwise sterling execution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.2)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from a lack of momentum due to repetitive sentence structures and expository phrasing. A template cadence emerges ("Her astronomical charts revealed...", "Her astronomical charts had shown...", "Her astronomical charts indicated..."), functioning as scaffolding for information dumps rather than propelling the narrative. This reliance on telling over showing makes the prose functional but flat, missing the texture and rhythm expected at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with high information density and striking, original imagery ("pulse rattling like loose rolling stock"). While consistently beautiful, the figurative language is so dense during the climax that it borders on overwriting, slightly slowing the momentum of the peak action. However, the piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, and the final lines land with precision and power.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.7)

    The prose is lush and demonstrates high information density, with sentences consistently performing multiple functions of characterization, world-building, and atmosphere. The figurative language is inventive and generally coherent, creating a distinct and memorable texture. However, the sheer density of metaphor and simile occasionally risks becoming overwrought, pushing to the edge of what the narrative can support without sacrificing momentum, as in "soft as daylily petals on the tongue of midnight solace."

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished, with figurative language that consistently deepens character and atmosphere. Sentences like "the blood had steamed on the ice like a war banner planted too early" and "the locked fence of her ribs" demonstrate high information density and poetic force.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and startlingly original figurative language that consistently serves the story's atmosphere. However, the story ends with an incomplete sentence fragment ("coven"), a critical mechanical error that shatters the otherwise perfect finish. For a piece this reliant on poetic precision, this flaw at the most crucial moment is a significant mark against its immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.6)

    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating exceptional information density where every image serves character, atmosphere, and plot. The language is both precise and poetic, with phrases like "riots blooming like morning glories" and an anthem that "flatline[s] into static." There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and the figurative language, while dense, is controlled and powerfully effective, especially in the peak moments of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is meticulously crafted, with a high density of figurative language that feels purposeful rather than overwrought. The sentence-level rhythm is controlled, modulating effectively to create the story's "radiant hush." While the density is immense, it rarely falters, with only a very occasional metaphor ("circuitry") feeling slightly out of place in the otherwise organic tapestry of the language.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and almost entirely free of artifacts. Each sentence is packed with information and atmosphere, propelling the narrative forward with a unique rhythm. Figurative language is sophisticated and coherent, as in "unpaid sorrow turn to wine on the tongue." While the density borders on overwriting in a few places, it never muddles clarity and ultimately serves the story's mythic tone, creating a rich and immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with nearly every sentence doing conceptual and atmospheric work. The language is precise and evocative, creating a distinct rhythm. While the high density of conceptual metaphors ("moral radiation," "protective vulnerability") borders on being overwritten, it remains consistent with the unique voice and premise, ultimately succeeding as a bold stylistic choice rather than a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and highly efficient, with standout lines like "her hair already silvering toward childhood." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to build atmosphere, character, or momentum. The language is dense with meaning without ever feeling overwritten, creating a clean and propulsive reading experience. The craft is pristine and meets the 9+ test with ease.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and highly figurative, with strong, evocative imagery. However, the final three paragraphs exhibit conceptual redundancy, restating the central epiphany—that he has become the echo, that the pulse is his own—in slightly different ways. This repetition, particularly the near-paraphrasing of "he had become the echo his grandmother had sent him to find," slightly dulls the impact of the powerful final image by over-explaining it, preventing the piece from achieving perfect concision at its close.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates extremely high information density, where nearly every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense with startlingly effective imagery. However, there are minor but noticeable prose artifacts—the repetition of "quietly enthusiastic" and the similar phrasing around "understanding static bursts." While the overall quality is exceptional, these small loops create a faint template cadence that slightly mars an otherwise flawless surface.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language that is almost always precise and evocative. Lines like "constellations crawled across the dome like silver lice" demonstrate a high level of craft. While bordering on overwriting, the language remains controlled and purposeful, contributing to a coherent, mythic atmosphere without sacrificing clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is a standout strength—clean, evocative, and possessing a powerful rhythm. There is zero scaffolding or redundancy; every word serves the story. Lines like "It didn’t ring. It wept" and the parallel structure of Kael's and the bell's tears demonstrate high-level craft. The final paragraphs, in particular, are executed with flawless precision and emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("twilight that clung...like damp gauze"). There are no significant loops or scaffolding. The score is slightly tempered by the final two paragraphs, where the language becomes more abstract and risks overwriting ("spin the submerged stories into something the living could carry together"), slightly dulling the impact of an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is consistently inventive and precise, such as the starlings pouring "like liquid iron" or the crystal's core glowing with "the hush before creation." While the style verges on being overwritten, its density feels purposeful, creating a rich, immersive texture that supports the story's magical tone. There are no discernible loops or scaffolding; the momentum is clean and propelled by crystalline imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional density and clarity, with every sentence advancing character, plot, or atmosphere. Figurative language, such as the burden settling "like the harness she wore," is purposeful and seamlessly integrated with the story's core motifs. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding or rhythmic monotony, achieving a line-level quality that is both elegant and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and rhythmic precision. Sentences like "The floating rock dojo drifted above the rewritten Pacific, its bamboo halls creaking while history rewrote itself for the seventh time that week" achieve immense world-building with incredible economy. The prose is clean, clear, and utterly free of scaffolding or redundancy, culminating in a final paragraph that is both beautiful and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet remains clear and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative ("gears that clicked like anxious teeth"). The deliberate repetition of key phrases ("storm-born silence," "notably receptive," "possibility just born") functions as a thematic refrain rather than a flaw, creating a resonant, incantatory rhythm. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every sentence carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Word choice is precise and evocative ("macerated," "ricocheted," "stitched"), and the figurative language is consistently fresh and powerful. The rhythm of the sentences shifts to match the action, from the sputtering start of the engine to the final, quiet walk home. There are no wasted words or scaffold phrases; every line contributes to the story's potent atmosphere and emotional weight. The density of metaphor feels earned rather than overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is virtuosic, with consistently inventive and beautiful figurative language. However, the prose is so relentlessly dense with metaphor that it borders on being overwritten, occasionally sacrificing momentum for poetic effect. While there are no technical flaws like loops or scaffolds, a touch more variation in sentence complexity would allow the most powerful images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and operates at an extremely high level of craft. While bordering on overwritten, it successfully teaches its own ornate pattern from the first sentence, making the style feel intentional and integral to the voice. The information density is superb, with recurring phrases ("frozen bloom," "penny drops") functioning as potent, evolving motifs rather than redundancies. The rhythmic control is excellent, creating a hypnotic, incantatory momentum that carries through to the powerful final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, dense with striking and coherent metaphors ("antennas humming like crickets that had learned grammar," "shattered tubes lay like fallen chandeliers"). Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot with remarkable economy. There are no loops, scaffolding, or overwritten passages; the figurative language serves to clarify and deepen the conceptual core rather than obscure it, resulting in a piece that is both beautiful and propelled by its own momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with no wasted words or motion. Figurative language is consistently inventive and precise, such as the moon that “dripped like melting silver” and stalactites “knitting together like fingers after prayer.” The sentences have a propulsive rhythm that carries the reader through the climax, demonstrating high-level craft with no discernible artifacts or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and dense with striking, purposeful imagery. However, a repetitive syntactic pattern acts as a noticeable prose artifact. The use of the "as memories alter..." construction three times creates a template cadence that feels mechanical upon rereading. While likely intentional, this loop slightly detracts from the otherwise fluid and inventive line-level craft, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of a very high caliber—dense, evocative, and rhythmic without becoming overwrought. Word choice is precise and imagery is consistently strong ("north becomes a diagonal, east a knife"). While the repetition of key phrases like "somber marvel" is a risk, here it functions as a successful poetic refrain that unifies the piece under its Accumulative/Textural lens. The final paragraph is nearly perfect, demonstrating exceptional control and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its figurative language ("swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light"). The rhythm is controlled, and word choice is consistently strong, creating a vivid atmosphere without overwriting. There are no technical flaws or distracting prose artifacts. The only minor weakness is the thematic summary near the end, which reads more like authorial scaffolding than organic prose, slightly disrupting the momentum before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control on every line. Figurative language, such as a "silent broadcast that still traveled the cable at the speed of regret," is both original and perfectly suited to the story's tone. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance the plot, deepen character, or enrich the atmosphere, resulting in a piece that feels both lean and profoundly resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and propelled by a powerful rhythm. However, the piece is critically marred by its incomplete final sentence: "the observatory dome glints like a half". This jarring error occurs at the most crucial point, dulling the closure image and breaking the story's spell. For a publication of this caliber, such a flaw at the finish line is a significant issue, requiring a substantial deduction from an otherwise exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is astonishingly dense and poetic, yet it maintains absolute clarity and propulsion. While risking over-saturation, the figurative language never becomes ornamental; instead, it is the fundamental mechanic of the story, enacting the theme of translation at the sentence level. There are no wasted words, no boilerplate phrases, just line after line of specific, resonant, and rhythmically powerful prose that serves the story's accumulative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and packed with vivid, original imagery. However, its relentless density occasionally feels overwrought. Nearly every sentence contains a striking metaphor or heightened description, which, while beautiful, can slightly overwhelm the narrative momentum and blunt the impact of any single image. The craft is high, but a touch more restraint in key moments would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, a stylistic risk that pays off completely by creating a unique and immersive atmosphere. Information density is high, with sentences like "the air filled with tarnished wonder, as if childhood fairy tales had been left out in the rain to rust" doing immense work. Despite its richness, the language remains clear and propulsive, with no overwritten passages that obscure the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both lyrical beauty and stark precision without a single misstep. Information density is remarkable; lines like "rotors chopping the brittle hush into anxious confetti" perform multiple functions with concision and flair. There are no artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every sentence propels the narrative with rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and often brilliant, with high information density and evocative figurative language. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled. However, the prose is so consistently saturated with metaphor and simile ("curved like the ribs," "comma punctuating the sentence," "lullaby of almost") that it occasionally risks feeling overwritten, slightly dulling the impact of the most crucial images through sheer density. It's a high-wire act that wobbles but never falls.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and evocative, original figurative language ("a comet tail of forgotten footnotes," "differential equations whose solutions were lullabies"). The prose is clean and propulsive, with varied syntax that matches the pace of Calla’s internal and external journey. There are no wasted words, overwritten passages, or prose artifacts; every sentence serves to deepen character, advance the accumulative structure, or enrich the potent atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense with imagery but remains clear and propulsive, avoiding the trap of overwriting. Sentence structure is varied, creating a powerful rhythm that carries the reader through the fantastical events. Word choice is precise and evocative ("tide tongues licked basalt runes," "a match struck in a cathedral of salt"). There are no visible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every line serves the whole with remarkable economy and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exceptionally dense with figurative language, yet skillfully avoids collapsing into overwriting by making metaphor the very engine of causality. Every line is purposeful and rhythmically controlled, turning what could have been a flaw into a defining strength, though its sheer richness walks a knife's edge of clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional from the first sentence to the last—dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative without becoming overwritten. Word choice is precise and sensory details are deployed for maximum effect. There are no loops, scaffolding, or other prose artifacts; every line carries its weight in advancing atmosphere, character, and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and inventive, precise figurative language ("smiled the way a blade smiles when it chooses not to cut"). The prose is ambitious without becoming overwrought, and the rhythm of the sentences effectively modulates the story's tension. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's cumulative power.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose demonstrates extraordinary control, balancing dense, figurative language with narrative clarity and propulsion. Word choice is precise and evocative, and the syntax varies to create a compelling rhythm. While the language borders on overwriting, it never sacrifices coherence, instead serving to heighten the story's specific, magical reality without a single wasted word or clumsy phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest literary quality. It is dense with meaning, rhythmically sophisticated, and rich with fresh, precise imagery ("scrape like frost against bone," "knots older than the sanctuary itself," "a diver walking on the seafloor of sound"). There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and no clichés. The figurative language is not merely decorative; it does essential work in building the story's world and emotional stakes, making the piece a profound pleasure to read on a line level.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and precise, with powerful verbs and specific, evocative imagery. Sentences are beautifully constructed, and the rhythm of the prose effectively carries the story's hushed, methodical tone. A few phrases verge on being slightly overwritten, with high figurative density in moments of discovery (e.g., "unspoken fears braided into a single, compassionate chord"), but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistently brilliant and conceptually coherent, as in "pressure preserving certain equations the way amber preserves flies." The piece is almost flawless at the line level, with no loops or scaffolding. The only slight blemish is the final sentence, where the register shifts into a slightly more clinical, declarative mode that momentarily steps away from the established lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently stunning, yet marred by a noticeable prose artifact. The repetition of the phrase "driftingly alert" three times and "tinkersong wonder" twice functions as a loop that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution. For a publication of the highest standard, this tic would require editorial intervention, preventing an otherwise exceptional piece from reaching the 9+ band in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is superb and the story’s greatest single strength. The prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive, with sentences that do multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is fresh and thematically integrated, such as joy being "disguised as ornament" or a sound being stored "like a bulb in her chest." There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought passages; every line is polished to a high sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose demonstrates high information density and rhythmic control, with each sentence advancing the story’s textural and narrative goals. The language is highly figurative (e.g., “a bruised nimbostratus pulsing with regret”), yet this density serves the story’s magical realist premise rather than obscuring it. While intensely rich, the line-level craft is free of loops or scaffolding, creating a seamless and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, original figurative language ("braille of stars," "philosophy and astronomy mixing... like slow-motion snow"). The line-level craft is nearly flawless, with a strong internal rhythm that propels the narrative forward. There are no wasted words or scaffold-like phrases. Each sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or the accumulative pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished and highly effective, characterized by high information density and striking, original metaphors ("brass ribs creaking like an old librarian," "shadows pooled like spilled ink"). The rhythm and syntax vary to match the scene's pacing, accelerating as Lira sprints to the engine galley. The recurring motif of "stranded luminance" is a strong example of purposeful repetition that deepens meaning with each use, showing excellent line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by syntactic variety, precise word choice, and a strong, consistent rhythm. Figurative language is dense but purposeful, building the story's unique atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The prose is clean, with no scaffolding or repetitive phrasing, ensuring that every sentence contributes to momentum and meaning. The recurring phrase "hauntingly bright" functions as a successful motif rather than a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence structures and vivid, precise imagery. The prose has excellent rhythm and propulsion. Its one weakness is a tendency towards overwriting; the density of figurative language is very high, with some metaphors feeling more decorative than clarifying ("shared anesthesia," "slow ripening into shared life"), which slightly dulls the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is of the highest order, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative language. Figurative language is dense but purposeful, consistently reinforcing the story's themes and atmosphere, as in "each backward second carving a lifeline she had never lived." There are no wasted words, no boilerplate phrases, and the propulsion from one sentence to the next is seamless. A tour de force of prose style.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise language ("clicking like metronomes," "lullaby of grinding teeth," "tiny white nooses"). Figurative language is consistently striking and tonally coherent, enhancing the atmosphere without feeling overwritten. The prose is clean, propulsive, and entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, demonstrating a high degree of authorial confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density and precise, evocative language ("fossilized moonlight," "grief itself had pupated"). The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, creating momentum without a single wasted word. A minor deduction is warranted for the repetition of the phrase "the pieces fell into place," which appears once at the moment of insight and again in the final summary paragraph, creating a small but noticeable echo in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently brilliant, with high information density and inventive, evocative language in every line. However, the sheer, unremitting density of figurative language, while masterfully executed, verges on overwriting and leaves little room for rhythmic variation or breath. While there are no technical flaws like loops or scaffolds, this stylistic choice makes the texture slightly less dynamic than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and economical, with high information density in every line. The rhythm is masterful, slowing for reflection and quickening with overwhelming sensation. Figurative language, such as the pavilion opening "like a throat," is consistently fresh and purposeful. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and a varied, musical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exquisite, marked by high information density, varied syntax, and powerful, coherent figurative language. Word choice is precise and evocative ("arboreal time," "cambium," "craze line"), creating a rich texture without a single wasted phrase. There are no loops or scaffolding; every sentence drives the story's momentum and deepens its atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lyrical and dense with evocative imagery, demonstrating strong sentence-level craft. The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative mood well. A minor weakness is a slight tendency toward repetition of key thematic phrases ("beauty in the difficult"), which, while purposeful, creates moments of conceptual looping rather than forward momentum, particularly near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, original figurative language that is consistently purposeful. Sentences like "The safe, scabbed with stickers from dismantled munitions plants, contained only one object: a locked diary clasped so tightly it seemed to be biting its own tongue" do immense work in a short space. The prose is clean, propulsive, and entirely free of scaffolding or artifacts, achieving a rare level of poetic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and precise, evocative language (“each footfall a syllable in a sentence spoken by the tree”). The prose is poetic without sacrificing clarity or momentum. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or the story's quiet propulsion toward its resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, achieving high information density without sacrificing lyricism or clarity. Sentence structure is varied and propulsive, avoiding repetitive patterns. The figurative language—"rivers loosened into spirals," "orchards spinning like slow kaleidoscopes"—is consistently fresh, coherent, and purposeful, enhancing both atmosphere and understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is mostly clear and functional, but it's marred by conspicuous repetition. The phrases "The hazy precision of her measurements" and "She was rapidly adapting" each appear twice, creating a noticeable paraphrase loop that feels like a prose artifact. While the imagery is strong elsewhere, these redundancies disrupt momentum and betray a lack of line-level polish expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by crystalline prose, inventive figurative language ("slow rainbows that dripped like wet paint"), and a rhythm that gracefully accelerates toward the climax. Information density is high, with nearly every sentence layering atmosphere, action, and internal state. A few phrases, like "marrow of existence," lean on familiar idioms, but these are rare exceptions in a work of exceptional polish.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high-density, evocative prose that does significant work in every sentence. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, consistently reinforcing the story's atmosphere and themes without becoming overwrought. The prose is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating exceptional control and artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is ambitious, inventive, and often stunning. However, the prose is burdened by moments of over-explanation in the final third, which read like authorial summary rather than character insight. The sentence beginning “Quince understood then…” is a prime example of telling what was already powerfully shown, momentarily flattening the momentum just before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with figurative language that consistently deepens the atmosphere and characterization ("negotiation between the solid earth and the liquid sky"). Sentence structure is varied and propulsive. There are no notable artifacts or loops; even the repetition of "extending the brief encounter" is used as a deliberate, escalating refrain that enhances momentum and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control in every line. Figurative language, such as the frost being a "secret braille" and the steering wheel "spinning like a galaxy," is both original and purposeful. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwriting; the piece is a model of concision and lyrical power, with a final line that perfectly seals the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, lyrical, and precise. Figurative language is both beautiful and functional, building the story's internal logic (e.g., "shuttle clacked like a second heart," "silence...pulled backward through the eye of a needle"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence drives the accumulative pressure toward the climax with masterful rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and frequently stunning, with high information density in every line. The rhythm and word choice are controlled and purposeful. However, the figurative language is so consistently elevated that it occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly insulating the reader from the raw immediacy of high-pressure moments like the lift jamming. This is a minor flaw in an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative but maintains remarkable clarity and propulsion. Word choice is precise and evocative ("bruised gold," "encrypted grief"), creating high information density where every line serves multiple functions. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the rhythm is controlled and purposeful, accelerating and decelerating in sync with the protagonist's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is of a publishable, literary quality, marked by high information density, striking figurative language, and rhythmic precision. Sentences like "The sound was the feeling of safety trying to fit inside metal" are ambitious and effective within the established voice. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, but the overall craft is capped by the structural flaw it is used to describe.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and almost uniformly successful. The figurative language is inventive and thematically coherent ("a chilled vein of lightning," "living headlines"). There is an exceptionally high information density to each line without sacrificing momentum. The piece avoids loops and scaffolding, demonstrating superb control over its complex syntax and rhythm, which modulates effectively to match the escalating unreality of the events.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and high-quality, marked by precise verbs and evocative imagery ("larks stitched songs between earth and sky"). However, there are a few instances of repetitive, idiosyncratic phrasing that read as prose artifacts. The phrase "valley-mist wonder" appears three times, and "quietly explosive" twice; while intentional, the recurrence slightly diminishes the unique impact of the language and feels like a minor authorial tic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is superb, exhibiting high information density and rhythmic propulsion without a single misstep. Figurative language, such as "constellations of sorrow" and a shadow "rooted in clouds," is both original and purposeful, deepening atmosphere without overwriting. The prose is clean, evocative, and polished to a degree that makes it immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with nearly every sentence performing multiple functions. Word choice is precise and evocative ("night had clotted," "coagulating into tarry vines"). While the high density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwhelming, it remains coherent and serves the story's fantastical, dreamlike atmosphere. The piece demonstrates exceptional control, with varied syntax and a strong rhythm that propels the narrative forward without any noticeable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense for most of the story, with memorable phrasing like "a woman-shaped hush." However, the final paragraphs shift into summary and thematic explanation, dulling the impact of the climax. The final sentence ("the wisest wisdom blooms from owning the flaw one longed to bury") is a prose artifact that violates the "show, don't tell" principle at the most critical moment, significantly weakening an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, characterized by high information density, rhythmic variety, and precise, evocative language. The prose is elegant and polished, with figurative language that feels earned and integral to the story's world. There are no wasted words or movements; every sentence serves to advance the atmosphere, character, or the accumulative pressure, resulting in a piece that feels both lean and richly textured.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, evocative, and surgically precise. Every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language, like "icicles of ink" and "breath blooming in quartz hush," is original and perfectly integrated. The rhythm and syntax modulate in step with the internal action, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience free of any overwriting or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate. While rich with figurative language, it never feels overwritten; every metaphor and simile serves to deepen character or atmosphere. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to control pace, moving from long, flowing descriptions to short, sharp statements like "We waited." The piece is a model of clarity, precision, and momentum, with no wasted words or line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking, original imagery. However, the final three paragraphs slightly over-articulate the resolution, creating a minor redundancy. The story lands its powerful concluding idea and then circles back to restate the transformation in slightly different terms, which marginally dilutes the sharp impact of the initial climax.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is consistently lyrical and inventive, with many striking images. However, its greatest strength is also a minor weakness: a tendency toward overwriting. The sheer density of metaphors and poetic phrasing in nearly every sentence, while often beautiful, occasionally thickens the prose and slows momentum, particularly in moments of high action. A slight reduction in figurative density would elevate the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exquisite, marked by high information density, varied sentence structure, and powerful, unmixed metaphors. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; each line contributes to atmosphere, character, or momentum. The final, deliberately incomplete sentence—"listen to the"—is a brilliant and confident stroke of line-level craft, transforming the ending from a statement into an invitation and perfectly embodying the story's theme.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elevated and imagistically dense, with strong, varied syntax. Lines like "her voice lived only in the shimmer of struck metal" show high information density and rhythmic control. While the language is ambitious and occasionally risks becoming overwrought, it remains coherent and serves the story's mythic tone. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, and its clarity remains high even amidst complex figurative language, though a few more grounded sentences might have provided beneficial contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong, specific imagery. Sentences like "reality folding inward like petals closing at dusk" are superb. The score is held back slightly by a few instances of abstract, diagnostic language ("fragmented wholeness," "sound of its own becoming") that label the experience rather than fully embodying it, particularly near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep until the final line. Sentences like "The courtyard held its breath with her; even the fountain hushed, as though the whole neighborhood had become one vast ear" are both beautiful and functional. The piece is devoid of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, and the syntax shifts elegantly to match the pacing of the narrative, creating momentum through sheer craft.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose demonstrates extraordinary information density and rhythmic control, with nearly every sentence serving multiple functions. While the figurative language is exceptionally rich, it rarely feels overwritten, instead building a cohesive and immersive texture. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The line-level craft is precise and propulsive, creating momentum through its poetic construction rather than in spite of it.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and startlingly original figurative language ("petals lifting as if sniffing the air for their lost moment"). There are no wasted words or scaffold-like phrases; each line propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere. The language is consistently inventive without ever becoming overwrought, demonstrating a masterful control of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and a compelling rhythm. The repetition of key phrases like "terrestrially cosmic" and "tranquil blaze" functions effectively as a recurring motif, reinforcing the story's core concepts without becoming redundant. The piece is clean and free of distracting line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, with powerful, memorable lines. However, a few moments slip into slightly too-direct exposition (the tutor’s explanation of her nature) or risk being on-the-nose (the radio lyrics). These are minor blemishes on an otherwise impeccable surface, but they slightly soften the pressure in key transitional moments.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional: dense with fresh, striking imagery yet clear and propulsive. Word choice is precise, and the rhythm is controlled and varied. The piece avoids overwriting, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and atmospheric weight. The craft is nearly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and clear, but it is significantly hampered by text-artifact issues. The repeated use of phrases like "calibrated treason" (5 times) and "heritage rose thorn" (4 times) creates a looping, scaffold-like effect that dulls momentum and feels mechanical. While motif is one thing, this level of repetition reads as a prose tic that reduces the overall elegance and information density of the lines, particularly when the phrases are long and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong, characterized by high information density and a confident, poetic rhythm. Figurative language is rich and purposeful, building the story's mythic atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The prose is clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding. The only minor weakness is a tendency toward aphoristic neatness in the final paragraphs, which slightly reduces the raw power of the closing images by adding a layer of intellectual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and precise. Every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or momentum without a wasted word. Figurative language ("planetarium of collective sorrow," "hymn that tasted like salt and forgiveness") is consistently fresh and purposeful. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with virtually every sentence doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is both beautiful and functional, as in "fireflies drifted like sparks from an invisible forge" or whisking memory "until it foamed into something drinkable." The piece demonstrates masterful sentence-level propulsion and information density without a single wasted word or clunky construction.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional: dense, evocative, and surgically precise. Figurative language, such as the Geiger counter’s "angry cicada" click or the dust drifts like "ghost tides," is consistently fresh and effective. The sentences exhibit strong forward momentum with varied structure, and there are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or overwritten passages, even under the pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with striking, original imagery and a powerful rhythm. Lines like "a frozen tree of blue-white light" and "the electromagnetic scream of dying knowledge" are both beautiful and functionally precise. While the figurative language is dense, it serves the story's accumulative mode and avoids becoming purely ornamental, contributing directly to the high-stakes atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, dense with evocative, precise imagery that never feels overwritten or muddled. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative with a quiet, confident momentum. Information is layered efficiently into every line, and the climax is rendered with a clarity and specificity that is both beautiful and emotionally devastating. There are no wasted words or technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, musical, and highly polished. Figurative language is consistently striking and purposeful, such as the sunset "like a wound healing in reverse" and the key's teeth "filed into frequencies." While the language is consistently elevated, it avoids becoming overwrought, maintaining clarity and propulsion even in its most lyrical moments. There are no discernible loops or artifacts; every sentence serves to build pressure or deepen the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, rhythmic precision, and stunningly original figurative language ("the lake cracked its knuckles," "a lung full of frost"). There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought passages. The prose propels the narrative with a quiet, steady momentum that perfectly mirrors the story's thematic core of patient, focused action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is outstanding—dense, evocative, and propulsive. Word choice is consistently strong, with powerful verbs and specific, sensory nouns creating a vivid and immersive experience ("complicity had calcified," "a small fortress of visibility"). The piece exhibits high information density without a single wasted word, and its sentence rhythms are varied and controlled to match the rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density and powerful imagery. Lines like "time recycled, penance mechanical" do tremendous work. The score is held back slightly by a few moments of aphoristic prose, such as "contrition without consequence is merely nostalgia," which feel more like authorial thesis statements than purely character-bound realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, with exceptional information density and momentum. Sentences are crafted with a poet's ear for rhythm and a cartographer's eye for precision. Figurative language is fresh and integrated ("gears the size of whales," "throbbed like a mechanical heart"), and there are no textual artifacts, loops, or wasted words. The opening and closing lines provide a perfect, resonant frame for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly effective, with strong verbs and evocative, consistent metaphors ("timestamps that pulsed like dying stars," "train that rattled like a dying hard drive"). While the figurative language is pervasive, it remains coherent and builds the story's unique atmosphere rather than obscuring it. The sentences are well-paced and clear, with no loops or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Its primary weakness lies in a few moments of authorial intrusion that feel like scaffolding, such as "The method was via glimpses..." These abstract explanations momentarily flatten the momentum and break the otherwise seamless narrative immersion, especially occurring near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous, with high information density and precise, evocative language. Figurative language is a major strength ("folded the air like linen," "a chime thinner than moonlight"). However, there are moments where the lyricism slightly overwrites the scene, bordering on preciousness, such as the final line's "lace learning the shape of weather." This, along with a few other overly-articulated descriptions, represents a hairline fissure in an otherwise flawless surface.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong rhythm and imagery. Its momentum is hindered by repetitive, abstract phrasing ("intersubjective understanding" appears three times). This specific prose artifact feels like authorial scaffolding left in the text, dulling the immediacy of the character's otherwise grounded and moving realization.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a significant paraphrase loop occurs in the climax, where two consecutive paragraphs describe the act of consecration using nearly identical phrasing ("not focusing directly," "holding the echo in his awareness's periphery"). This redundancy measurably dulls the momentum of the story's most crucial sequence, constituting a notable flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic prose, and inventive figurative language. Sentences like "The spiral mattered...the way constellations are a method for sailors" do immense work in a small space. While the prose is consistently elevated and dense with metaphor, it remains coherent and purposeful, avoiding the trap of becoming overwrought. The final line about cursive only bees can read is a daring flourish that successfully lands within the established whimsical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is dense with meaning, rhythmically varied, and free of any loops or scaffolding. Figurative language, such as memory growing "like rings in a tree" or years settling "like sediment," is fresh, consistent, and deepens the story's atmosphere and themes without ever feeling overwritten. Every word feels necessary and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and consistently high-level, with striking and original figurative language. Each sentence works to build the story's unique atmosphere and advance its textural argument, demonstrating high information density without feeling overwritten. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the rhythm is controlled and varied, propelling the narrative forward with a slow, tidal momentum that matches the story's tone perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language ("a soft guillotine," "origami of steel and glass"). While the recurring phrase "luminous ache" borders on repetition, its modulation across different contexts justifies it as a powerful, intentional motif. The prose is almost entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, creating a propulsive and poetic momentum from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both lyricism and precision from the opening sentence. Information density is high, with imagery and action constantly doing multiple jobs. The rhythm is controlled, sentences are varied and propulsive, and there are no discernible text artifacts, loops, or overwriting, even in moments of high emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imaginative, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery from the opening sentence. The line-level craft is exceptional, avoiding cliché and maintaining momentum. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraph, where the narrative voice shifts towards a more summative, explanatory tone that slightly spells out the story's meaning, momentarily breaking the "show, don't tell" principle that the rest of the piece executes so well.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of publication quality, characterized by high information density and fresh, potent figurative language ("apology choking in smoke," "constellations instead of scars"). The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative without a single wasted word or clunky construction. It is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, and the language in the climactic scene remains both beautiful and clear, a significant achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in its figurative language. However, the sheer saturation of metaphors and similes occasionally verges on overwriting, where the density can slightly blunt the impact of individual images. For instance, "eyes wide as lunar craters, mouth a shoreline receiving tide" is potent but part of a cascade of figures that risks aesthetic fatigue just shy of the climax. A touch more restraint would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, beautiful, and controlled, with very high information density and precise word choice. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that in a few places it borders on overwriting, momentarily slowing the momentum with its own artistry. For instance, the line "healing required a pattern... a cadence slow enough for shame to melt without shattering the thing it shaped" is a gorgeous assertion but slightly less propulsive than the surrounding embodied prose. This hairline excess is the only factor keeping the score from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language is consistently original and purposeful, such as the mist clinging "like marginalia" or fog curling "into quotation marks." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. The rhythm and syntax vary to match the emotional tenor of the scene, creating a piece that is as beautiful at the line level as it is structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely stunning, with vivid imagery and a strong, varied rhythm. However, its momentum is occasionally interrupted by sentences that lapse into clunky exposition, summarizing the story's rules instead of embodying them (e.g., the long sentence explaining the mnemonic function of the pollen). While the descriptive density is mostly a strength, these moments of direct explanation stand out against the otherwise elegant craft.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, exhibiting remarkable sentence-level craft, rhythmic control, and high information density. Figurative language is consistently fresh and integral to the story's world ("auroras that pruned the branches with blades of cold green fire"), serving to build atmosphere and reveal character without a single overwrought or ornamental line.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exquisite and information-dense, with striking, original metaphors that consistently do narrative work. Nearly every sentence is polished to a high sheen. If there is a fault, it is that the prose is so relentlessly elevated that it occasionally draws attention to its own artistry, as in the almost-too-perfect neatness of the cavern's "hush like pages closing." It is a hairline fracture in a work of immense craft.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, yet maintains clarity and propulsion throughout. The language is consistently inventive ("whalebone reverie," "calcifying the air") without feeling overwritten, creating a unique and immersive texture. Sentence structure and rhythm vary effectively, accelerating with the sputtering lamp and settling into a calm cadence at the end. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language is specific and powerful ("steam ghosting the loft like the breath of animals waiting in the dark") without ever feeling overwritten. There are no wasted words, no repetitive sentence structures, and no syntactic loops; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the story’s accumulative momentum. The final line, in particular, is a masterclass in concision and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is a significant strength, characterized by high information density and startlingly original figurative language. Sentences like "The carousel’s music box core...subsides into fractured stillness, the kind of silence that rings in broken teeth" are both beautiful and purposeful. While dense with imagery, it never feels overwritten because the metaphors are integral to the story's logic and world, consistently advancing atmosphere and character without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with a varied rhythm and high information content in each line. Figurative language is rich and purposeful, consistently reinforcing the story's central themes and atmosphere. The score is held back from the highest tier only by the jarring, incomplete final sentence ("Weeks later, when the city above"), a significant prose artifact that abruptly truncates an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmically controlled. The deliberate repetition of key phrases like "glacial hush" and "excruciatingly gentle" functions not as a flaw, but as a powerful, incantatory refrain that enhances the story's ritualistic quality. This stylistic choice is bold and successfully executed, reinforcing theme and atmosphere at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest literary quality—dense, precise, and rhythmically sophisticated. Every sentence carries weight, advancing the story while building atmosphere.

Sentences are rhythmically varied, propelling the narrative forward while maintaining a contemplative, hushed tone. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the accumulative pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless, with a varied sentence structure that supports the story's incantatory rhythm. The figurative language is both beautiful and functional, driving the story's unique logic. While the density of metaphor is high, it rarely feels overwritten and instead contributes to the Accumulative/Textural drive. A few phrases feel slightly too abstract ("whatever force collected explained absences"), but these are minor and do not detract from the momentum or clarity of the powerful closure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is the highlight of an exceptional piece, demonstrating remarkable density and precision without sacrificing momentum. Figurative language is inventive and purposeful, with metaphors that consistently deepen character and theme, such as "creation is just destruction running backwards in borrowed shoes." The line-level craft is immaculate, with varied rhythms and a complete absence of scaffolding or cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: precise, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language is consistently fresh and thematically grounded, as in skin that "rippled like cooled lava" or sand clinging "like guilty fingerprints." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, and the story’s emotional trajectory with grace and power.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and highly figurative, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft and information density. While the density of metaphor verges on overwriting, it remains coherent and purposeful, contributing significantly to the atmosphere. The rhythmic, parallel structure of the central section feels like a deliberate and effective stylistic choice, enhancing the story's ritualistic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with luminous imagery and a controlled, poetic rhythm. The information density is excellent, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. The piece is slightly weakened by the final two paragraphs, where the syntax becomes more declarative and summary-like ("And so the generations turned..."), which ever so slightly lessens the propulsive, imagistic momentum built throughout the rest of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, but it rarely feels overwritten because each image serves the central theme and advances the accumulative pressure. Sentences like "She asked the ghost its name, and it answered with the scent of lilies cut too soon" demonstrate masterful concision and information density. The rhythm is hypnotic and controlled, with no significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, original figurative language. Sentences like "Salt air corrodes certainty; the tower’s iron bones already blush with orange grief" demonstrate a rare fusion of beauty and narrative function. The prose is entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, achieving a poetic quality that enhances rather than obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, demonstrating high-level craft in sentence construction and rhythm. The language is consistently evocative and precise. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraph, where a sentence functions more as authorial scaffolding to explain the theme, slightly disrupting the momentum of an otherwise seamless piece.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense with powerful, resonant imagery and demonstrates exceptional control over rhythm and syntax. While highly figurative, it avoids incoherence; each metaphor deepens the story's world and themes, such as futures consuming their authors "greedily."

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is both lyrical and precise, with a high density of information and imagery in every sentence. While highly figurative, the language avoids overwriting because the metaphors are integral to the story's internal logic, not ornamental.

Figurative language is inventive and consistent with the story's world ("fossil of shame," "ghost heartbeat"). The piece avoids scaffolding and redundancy, with each sentence advancing the narrative or deepening the atmosphere.

    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense with imagery, rhythmically controlled, and precise in its diction. Every sentence serves a purpose, advancing atmosphere, character, or the central action without a single wasted word. The figurative language, such as silence like "velvet turned inside out," is consistently fresh and potent, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is exquisite, with dense, evocative sentences that carry multiple layers of meaning. The prose is rich with inventive metaphors ("edible scripture," "stained-glass forgiveness") that are central to the story's effect. The piece avoids clutter, and its rhythm is controlled and purposeful, slowing for moments of sensory intake and accelerating with the celestial clock. A minor weakness is the final thematic summary, which feels slightly less sharp than the concrete imagery that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm and syntax support the dreamlike, quiet atmosphere. While the language is elevated, it rarely feels overwritten and contributes significantly to the story's power. A minor weakness is a slight tendency to name the emotion or motivation directly, as in "her motivation to preserve wonder...flared," which could have been left implicit in her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating remarkable information density and rhythmic control. While the figurative language is dense, it remains coherent and purposeful, building atmosphere rather than obscuring meaning.

The line-level execution is clean and confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is largely elegant, precise, and rhythmic, with strong imagery and varied syntax. However, the line “Elara slipped the letter inside her coat, 心跳 counting options like a metronome” contains a critical text artifact. This is not a stylistic choice but a flaw that breaks immersion and clarity, representing a significant failure in line-level execution that prevents an otherwise publishable piece from succeeding.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and dense, showcasing a remarkable command of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are crafted with precision, and figurative language consistently deepens character and atmosphere, such as the pavilion accepting a note "like a mouth accepts a bittersweet lozenge."

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and often evocative, with strong verbs and a confident rhythm ("groaned like a waking beast," "sound like wings"). Momentum is well-maintained. A minor weakness is a moment of conceptual redundancy, as when the text explains the "perpetually surprised" trait immediately after naming it, which slightly flattens the prose in that beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is polished and professional.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are information-rich, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("bruised sky," "skeleton of light"). However, the final third suffers from some conceptual redundancy and abstract phrasing that slightly dulls momentum. Sentences like "...her poverty revealed as the ultimate gift" and "...she'd come to the volcano to lose everything and had gained the universe" are paraphrase-loops that restate the same thematic conclusion, feeling like unnecessary scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, characterized by high information density and striking, original metaphors ("sky-barges...drift like startled swans"). The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "Morse that spelled maybe" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One near-loop ("flickering faith" repetition) justified by evolution from paddle blades to philosophical stance, enhancing rather than obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats like "bioluminescence crawled under his skin, illuminating bones like paper lanterns" achieve high density without muddle. Opening ("stitches would imprint a map on his skull") and closing ("loop tightening like a stitch") create resonant cadence. Figurative language remains legible under narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "tasted her first kiss" serves character and closure; minor risk of purple prose in "caravan of memories" avoided by visceral specificity, keeping propulsion intact through climax.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "porcelain voices rose, asking why Mommy never finished the tea party" achieves triple duty (character, setting, stakes). Final line’s "sipping imaginary tea with children who exist forever in the choking beauty of almost" perfects cadence. One near-miss: "choking beauty" repetition risks slight dilution in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops with exceptional density: "thumb-sized droplet of glassy jade said to have fallen from the goddess’s cheek" layers meaning economically. Slight overwriting in "bruise in space" risks muddling but serves accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line propulsion stumbles in climax with stacked metaphors ("galaxy had fallen to earth," "skeleton of light"); near-simultaneous "dissolving" and "vibrant hush" images create minor coherence drift without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels action ("She set the timer... relays would close"). Final line’s "secret smile" recharges the opening "winking hush" with crystalline precision, avoiding figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; "slickness of the rocks beneath him that should have sent him sliding" shows friction’s absence while advancing plot. Final line ("light as the promise he’d carried") recharges the opening with crystalline concision, avoiding figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "rarefied air" and "cartography of scars" recur with accumulating weight. Figurative language serves pressure ("censored passages bloom like fresh bruises") without muddle. Minor overwriting risk in "violet flashes printed silver halide ghosts" narrowly avoids density penalty through precise chemical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; "fractured light" and "gear-hum" achieve high density. Minor rhythm hiccup in "migratory logic" treatise reference disrupts propulsion, but final line's "soft prick of needle through fabric" delivers resonant closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "luminous fracture" avoids purple prose by tethering metaphor to iron physics. Sentences vary from staccato ("No time to flee") to lyrical flow, with "desert will remember how beauty clawed itself from anarchy" achieving crystalline closure without sentimentality. Only microscopic flaw: "sirens wail distant" slightly tells.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Steely longing" risks label-speak but is redeemed by context; otherwise pristine propulsion. Deducted for isolated template cadence in "Hand over hand she ascended..." weakening immediacy during high-stakes climb.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("shuddered," "knitting," "battered"). Figurative language serves momentum: "dragon’s back" scales deepen setting’s pressure without muddle. Minor deduction: "luminous doubt" borders on thematic label but earns weight through final action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "compass needle swung, hunting for iron that no longer existed" does triple duty (character, theme, tension). Final line’s "fertile ground" avoids muddle while recharging tide motif with closure cost.
