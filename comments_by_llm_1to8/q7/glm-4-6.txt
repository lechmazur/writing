  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high: most lines advance character, discovery, or atmosphere without scaffolding. One minor paraphrase loop: "He understood now. His purpose was not found in the grand unveiling, but in the pauses where the frost forms" restates the earlier motivation without added pressure (−0.2). No template cadence, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language ("ghosts and scorched earth," "stars stitching," "truth settling…like light") remains controlled and legible, though the final "settling like light" metaphor borders on stock. Clarity and propulsion are strong; the Text Artifact Screen flags no major scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose carries significant scaffold and paraphrase loops: "The capsize survivor" opens eight sentences, creating template cadence; "unshaken marvels" recurs five times without functional variance; "tuning fork case" appears in four separate beats, often restating its presence without advancing pressure. Sentences frequently paraphrase: "She had done it—transformed silence into a form of music, a language of heat and harmony" immediately follows the scanner display, adding no new information. The final third stacks summary statements ("her heart full, her purpose clear," "that was all that mattered") that dull the closure image. Mixed metaphors appear: "clung to like a life raft in the aftermath of the flood" conflates shipwreck with flood. These artifacts pervade the ending, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several template patterns recur: "The [X] who [past action] now [present state]" appears three times across the piece. The phrase "inadvertent stubbornness manifesting as" in paragraph three reads as scaffolding that explains rather than shows. "Chased stillness" and "permanent address" are repeated across multiple paragraphs without reweighting, approaching synonym churn. The underwater library description is vivid, but "Mirrormere, drowned in 1889" introduces a proper noun that appears once and does no work.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is grammatically clean and comprehensible, with varied paragraph lengths. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not the loud clamor of rebellion, but an amplified quiet" is restated as "in the amplified quiet of their sanctioned world, that was the loudest sound of all." Synonym churn surfaces in "gentle persistence" → "gently persistent" → "quiet, persistent care." Template cadence runs across multiple sentences: "He would declare… He would ring… He packed… He rang… She was… Her task was…" and "The sanctions period stretched… The silver bell sat… Lena ran… The sanctions would eventually lift…" Figurative density spikes without clear payoff ("bones rather than startle the air," "pillars like sentinels," "wildflowers in the cracks"). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the piece: "Three days had passed since the past life memory surfaced" is immediately re-explained; "spiritually curious" recurs as label without varied embodiment; stock metaphors ("light and shadow danced," "webs of light") appear in most beats without fresh vehicle. Figurative density in high-pressure moments (the healing sequence) mixes incompatible vehicles (sparks, webs, bridges, currents) without coherence. The final paragraph loops thematic summary across three adjacent sentences, flattening momentum. Penalty range: −1.2 for loops and density clutter touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "looped into impossible spirals," "time itself were chewing them to bits," "hyperbolic geometry shifting beneath him," "branches dripping with halo fragments." Mixed metaphors accumulate: bridges "pulsed faintly, as if breathing" yet also "disintegrating into petals"; photographs "crumbling to dust" yet earlier "edges curling inward." Template cadence appears in repeated "the fragment + verb" constructions and "He + past tense" stems. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("felt the hyperbolic geometry collapse," "saw her") dull immediacy. Paraphrase loops: "garden resisted" → "garden seemed to pulse in answer" within two sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and loops. Dense figurative language in high-pressure beats ("chains clanking like funeral bells," "blood and dust mingling on his lips," "quiet certainty growth would follow") piles metaphor without breathing room. Paraphrase loops appear: "resilience he meant to plant" / "plant resilience in dry soil" / "resilience took root." Template cadence ("The chains were not his true prison; the countdown was" / "Now, that arrow lay…" / "The vault was below…") flattens rhythm. The final third repeats "staggering grace" and "resilience" as thematic labels rather than advancing pressure, triggering artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory specificity is high. Information density is strong: most sentences layer character, atmosphere, and forward motion. However, figurative language clusters heavily in the final third ("symphony of what-ifs," "collision of histories," "shadows stretching like arms") without escalating clarity or pressure, and several paraphrase loops appear ("not out of spite, but out of battered marvel" closely echoes earlier phrasing about searching for the sound). One micro-loop: "the sound of trust breaking" repeats identically three times without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but several paraphrase loops appear: "He'd spent weeks decoding its secret" immediately followed by "a language of petals and stems—codes in flower arrangements that only he could read" restates the same content without added pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("moonbeams swirling like liquid starlight," "shadows painted in honey," "destiny's door") without clear escalation or pattern payoff. The final third contains stock phrasing ("his heart lighter than it had been in years," "a beacon for the illuminated moments yet to come") that dulls the closure image. Loops and elevated register in peak beats warrant −0.6 to −0.8; mid-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies; imagery is vivid (icicles as clocks, flame as spirit, steam eruption). Minor loops: "cracked leather bookmark" appears six times with minimal variation; "weighty lightness" recurs without evolution. The phrase "冰冷 prison" (Chinese characters meaning "icy-cold") interrupts the English prose without preparation or payoff, reading as artifact or mistaken paste. Template stems ("He [verb]") appear in several beats but do not flatten momentum severely. Information density is adequate; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "trust was a luxury he couldn't afford, not after the betrayal that had left him hollow" restates the premise without advancing pressure; "its whispers silenced, its purpose fulfilled" is synonym churn. Template cadence runs dominate: "The library's doors…," "The seashell lay…," "The rusted library…" across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("stars like scattered salt," "stacks loomed like skeletons") and elevated diction ("trembling certainty," "ozone") clash with the POV's urgency. Apply −1.2 for multiple artifact types, −0.5 additional for touching closure ("he had outwitted himself").

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and grammar are clean, but paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "flaking gold leaf booklet" appears five times in identical phrasing; "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" recur without variation; sentence stems repeat ("Kaelen's method," "Kaelen's fingers," "Kaelen had"). The phrasing "the pebble-shore oracle" and "the fort's commander" substitute descriptors for names, creating distance without voice motivation. High figurative density ("bruised violet sky," "wind's persistent fingers," "overlapping silhouettes," "gateway," "doorway") in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching triggers overwriting penalties. Information density is moderate, but scaffold and loop artifacts touch multiple beats including near-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence variety is adequate, and no major loops or template cadence runs appear. However, several lines carry scaffold artifacts: "The second chance program was a misnomer" and "The second chance program had failed, but 734 had succeeded" repeat the phrase without adding pressure. "Remarkably composed" recurs three times as a stock closer without variation. Figurative language is competent but occasionally generic ("tiny rainbows," "tiny stars"). Information density is moderate; some beats advance multiple jobs, but others (e.g., the Thorne flashback) summarize rather than compress strategically.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and sensory detail is vivid (crystal whispering stones, rain-kissed, ceramic clinking). However, patterned artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences ("the quiet wasn't empty—it was full of potential, of stories waiting to unfold" followed by lens-as-relic summary; "freed by honesty" repeated three times in the final third), template cadence runs of "The registrar [verb]" across multiple beats, and stock metaphors ("shoulders knotting like tangled thread," "wrapped around them like a blanket"). The final paragraph stacks summary-tell ("the registrar understood," "he decided," "they all knew") that dulls the closure image rather than sharpening it. Filter-verb density ("he'd seen," "he realized," "he knew," "he understood," "he decided," "he glanced") clusters in the final third, flattening immediacy. Apply −1.2 for loops, template cadence, and filter stacks touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm breathes, but clarity suffers under stacked modifiers and paraphrase loops. "The mended deception at the heart of Elias's collection was his own invention: when polished with his secret formula... the cracked marbles would appear perfectly whole, their imperfections invisible" restates the same concept across two clauses. The phrase "blooming withering balance" is used twice without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("silent recognition," "weathered bark," "unshakable conviction") accumulate in peak beats. The climax leans on filter verbs and explanatory interiority ("he understood that gardens do know their gardeners") rather than image. Template cadence: "Each evening... he would take out... he would add another marble... Tonight... he began to polish" creates a drumbeat rhythm. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops, template stems, and stock phrasing; −0.3 additional for filter-verb stacks in the climax (total −1.1).

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence and phrase recycling pervade: "mechanically warm" appears four times, "icy warmth" twice, "subdued awakening" and "obliging sky mechanic" recur without reweighting. Paraphrase loops ("the nexus pulsed more intensely, its warmth radiating...creating that perfect icy warmth") and synonym churn ("The device fascinated Elias—mechanically warm to the touch...its smooth surfaces emanating a gentle heat") dull momentum. Opening stems repeat ("Elias adjusted," "Elias positioned," "Elias nodded," "Elias allowed"). Artifacts cluster in closure beats ("icy warmth of discovery," "subdued awakening"), disallowing high-band entry. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts plus −0.3 for closure-beat contamination; cumulative −1.7 in Q7 and global 9+ disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "wordless conversation" appears four times, "in between spaces" three times, "antique opera program" five times with minimal variation. Template cadence in multiple beats ("The musician held... his heart racing"; "The musician carefully arranged... his fingers itching"; "The musician knew... he would need"). Stock metaphors ("heart racing," "trapped him here," "bridge the gap") and therapy-speak framing ("inspiration had lately taken hold of his spirit"). Heavy filter-verb reliance ("felt unmistakably," "knew that," "understood that") flattens immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph recycles "in between spaces," "wordless conversation," "antique opera program").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (truth as stone, fever as violent inoculation) mostly clarifies. However, template cadence appears in stacked constructions: "It was here she'd been left, here she'd consumed"; "not with her eyes but in the humming quiet"; "not in its substance but in the gravitational pull." The phrase "swaying certainties, persistent flickers that endure" and "fault-tolerant oracle" read as scaffolding from the prompt rather than organic prose. Overwriting clusters in the brother-revelation paragraph, where mixed metaphors ("fractures...in the data," "erased by disbelief") blur without intensifying. These artifacts touch the closure third, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "throat of cold stone," "judgments," "creeping surreal clarity," "spectral factory running on unresolved energy," "ozone and regret," "tears frozen in time." The figurative density appears in most sentences of the climax without taught pattern or payoff, triggering a −0.7 deduction. Paraphrase loops: "swallowed truth" and "weight" recur across four adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Filter-verb stack in the climax: "felt," "looked," "understanding dawning," "thought" cluster across three lines, dulling immediacy (−0.5). One typo ("swallowe d truth" with space) and the stray "世的" character add copy errors. Sentence rhythm varies but stock metaphors ("cut through darkness like a scalpel," "beads felt like tears frozen in time") reduce originality. Information density is moderate; some moves do double duty (valve = grief outlet) but the ending's relief is asserted rather than shown through concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.9)
    Density is uneven: many sentences do double duty (e.g., "the concept of self became as tenuous as morning mist, thoughts diffusing until only pure witnessing remained"), but others loop or paraphrase (e.g., "the regenerative silence" appears six times with near-synonym phrasing). Template cadence is visible: runs of "The keeper [verb]" and "silence … silence" across adjacent lines. Mixed metaphor: "burrowing through … folds" conflates spatial movement and dimensional passage without coherent vehicle. Figurative language is dense but not pattern-taught, and much of it appears in mid-pressure descriptive passages rather than peak beats. Several paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences (e.g., reality-looseness restated in paragraph 1, silence restated in paragraphs 1 and 3). Scaffold phrases like "through the origami swan's interior dimensions" recur without variation. High-priority loop check fails; synonym churn is present. Apply baseline artifact penalty −0.8 in Q7 for paraphrase loops, template cadence, and filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening (strings/notes/gentle craft; locket/curl/promise all restate the same content within three sentences). Template cadence appears mid-story: "The music seemed to collect...creating a bridge...Leo finally began to cross" stacks abstract metaphors without embodied action. Register drifts into elevated therapeutic diction ("lifelong wonder," "cautious exuberance," "emotional reconnection") that exceeds Maya's immediate perception under pressure. Figurative density in the eclipse peak (hollow between earth/sky, bridge of sound, dreaming roots) blurs rather than sharpens the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentences are grammatically clean but exhibit template cadence: "Aria moved," "Aria decided," "Aria recorded." The opening and mid-section rely on summary phrasing ("For three years since," "More diary entries revealed") that stalls momentum. Stock metaphors ("embers refusing to die," "fabric of the world") appear without fresh context. Information density is moderate; many lines restate the premise rather than advancing pressure. The final image ("faintest hint of stirring") lacks the concrete specificity that would charge it.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.9)
    Syntax varies and rhythm supports the tone. Several paraphrase loops weaken density: "The network would collapse, not with a bang, but with a whisper, its fragments scattered like confetti" followed by "Each one a cryptic invitation to transposition" rehashes theme without advancing action. Template cadence appears in backstory: "He wasn't a hero or a villain; he was a rearranger." Stock metaphors ("ghost in the machine," "strings were made of ink and light") cluster without fresh specificity. No artifact touches the closure beat directly, limiting the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template cadence is pervasive: "The priest [verb]" opens nine sentences, flattening propulsion. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third ("The priest's method was through rhetorical devices" immediately after "his chant grew louder, the loops overlapping until they formed a tapestry of rhetorical devices"). "Unraveling stillness" and "dimensional anchor" repeat without accruing new meaning. Filter verbs ("The priest was here," "His motivation was clear") stack in expository beats. No mixed metaphors or major clarity breaks, but density is low and momentum sags under repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or spatial disorientation. The opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly, and the final image recharges the shell and mirrored horizon. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Each window pane, each icicle...corresponded to a moment, a feeling, a half-forgotten song" followed immediately by "He began his methodical ascent...Each window pane, each icicle, corresponded to a moment"; "He was a conductor" repeated twice in close proximity; "chronological homesickness" and variants appear four times without evolving function. Template stems recur ("He moved to the next marker," "He thought of," "He was still"), and stock metaphors ("heart heavy," "eyes sting") dull key beats. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 in Q7, and their presence in the final third disqualifies 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence pervades: "The tablet's runes…" appears six times, "The viaduct…" five times, creating a drumbeat that dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third ("The labyrinth of self stretched before him" / "The labyrinth of self was relentless" / "The labyrinth wasn't just in his mind"). Mixed metaphors appear: "darkness brightened" is asserted twice without physical grounding, and "obscene shapes" clashes with the ethereal glow established earlier. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("The labyrinth of self was conquered"), triggering the heavier end of the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several loops appear: "audibly muted" recurs without added pressure (opening, middle, near end); "filament of hush" appears three times with near-identical phrasing. The phrase "turning seasons outside" bookends without transformation. Figurative density is high throughout ("drawn bowstring," "tapestry of scrapes," "ghost of its former self") and some metaphors clash—"crumbling of tonal structures" as "physical presence" mixes incompatible vehicles. Two untranslated Chinese characters (混乱, 终于) disrupt legibility. Apply paraphrase-loop and figurative-density penalties cumulatively: −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear and advances the story, but several artifacts accumulate. "Credibly curious" is a therapy-speak label; "nurture his integrity in peace" abstracts motivation rather than embodying it. The phrase "the weight of the tube felt heavier, as if it carried more than just paper" is stock metaphor. "By progressing laterally" repeats twice in near-identical phrasing, a paraphrase loop. The Chinese character "记录者" is unexplained and breaks the line. Figurative language is present but not dense enough to trigger the overwriting deduction. Information density is acceptable, but momentum sags in the middle paragraph of reflection. No major causality obscuration, so artifact penalties remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "impossible choice" and its synonyms recur without added pressure, and "texture of time" is restated four times across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Langdon + verb" or "The + noun." Stock metaphors ("braiding our own nooses," "origami made of twilight") stack without coherent vehicle logic. The final paragraph is a thematic summary rather than image-driven propulsion, dulling the closure beat. Figurative density in non-peak beats ("delicious predicament," "honey-thick viscosity") inflates without momentum gain. Combined artifact penalty: −1.4.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is specific ("bronze surface worn smooth," "frames groaning in the wind"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "the echoes had shifted—no longer the hollow silence of loss, but the faint stir of renewal" restates the transformation already shown. The phrase "chronic hush" recurs mechanically without escalation. Template cadence in the climax ("She stood... She lifted... She lowered...") flattens propulsion. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent; "tone without harmony" and "canvas" work, though "both artist and artifact" edges toward stock abstraction. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "The amber grotto at dusk" opens three separate beats; "professionally thorough" and "sensing through the static electricity" recur as label reminders rather than varied dramatization. The transformation "completed" appears at story open, midpoint, and close without clear differentiation. Figurative language is frequent but often mixed: light "thickening like honey" pairs awkwardly with walls that "shimmer" and later "close in" then "wrap around them like a blanket." Stock phrases cluster in emotional beats: "fierce, quiet determination," "quiet act of communion," "quiet satisfaction."

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several images land cleanly ("sea fog on the pier," "falling leaves," "soft click"). However, the piece carries moderate scaffold: "cautious exuberance" appears twice in identical phrasing; "silent contributors" recurs without fresh angle; the opening analogy "audience rose like a tide" is followed by "dispersing crowd" within two paragraphs, creating a paraphrase loop. The final third leans on summary ("she would later learn," "cycles of compassion worked") that flattens momentum. Figurative density in early paragraphs (tide, sea fog, moths) is well-handled, but the closing beats rely on exposition rather than image propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but several loops and scaffold patterns appear: "luminescence" recurs four times as abstract label; "the webs of kinship" appears three times identically; "boldly sympathetic" is repeated without fresh context. Metaphoric density is high throughout ("wind over glass," "threads of longing," "beacons," "dialect of the heart") without meaningful variation in texture, creating a sustained elevated register that dulls peak moments. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("We're home," "the world answered with light," "had finally learned to listen") rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose carries momentum through the skiff journey and features strong sensory anchors (damp metal, slick flagstone, neon rivers). However, multiple line-level issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the giant's nap was his entire lifespan, a span he alone could perceive"; "more than a passion; it was a rebellion, a means to catalogue"), a template-cadence run in the opening third (repeated "his X, a Y" structures), and stock metaphor strings ("rivers of neon," "ghosts of lost species"). The phrase "更多人 than just a single" appears mid-sentence as a generation artifact, breaking immersion. Register drifts into elevated abstraction at closure ("the all-at-once of sound and memory") when concrete image would serve better, and the final paragraph toggles between cosmic consequence and asserted serenity without bridging the tonal gap.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Paragraph structure supports scene progression. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "gently inventive approach" is repeated three times, and the drip-drip-drip motif recurs without added pressure. The vision paragraph tells rather than shows ("wasn't an image of what had happened... but of how her absence had transformed")—a summary that dulls what should be the story's most charged beat. Mixed metaphor: tears "sizzled" creating "wisp-like clouds of steam" on stone lacks physical logic unless the stone is impossibly hot. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 4: "had discovered," "had developed," "had vanished." Stock phrase "breathtakingly simple" in revelation moment. These clusters prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is largely clear with varied sentence structure and strong atmospheric detail. However, several paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "his fingers tracing familiar paths" / "his weathered fingers had discovered"; "the art of uncovering treasures" / "learned the art of"; "methodical nature had served him" / "quickly but methodically." The final two paragraphs contain explanatory scaffolding ("his motivation had always remained clear," "the true illumination came moments later") that could be cut. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold remains visible. No major artifacts touch the closure beat directly, limiting deduction under the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Figurative language ("bruised purple," "green semaphore") is purposeful and legible. Minor deductions: "circuitously sincere" appears twice in identical phrasing, creating a small loop; "reluctant metamorphosis" is named explicitly as a concept rather than only demonstrated, edging toward thesis-language. The phrase "his approach circuitously sincere in its clinical attempt" reads slightly overwrought for the POV's scientific mindset. Otherwise clean, with strong propulsion and no grammatical errors. Artifact presence in non-closure beats applies −0.6 cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied. However, the piece carries paraphrase loops: "Experience withers without witness" / "thresh meaning from experience" / "threshing meaning from experiences too vast" recur across beats without added pressure. Template-cadence runs appear in list-like transitions ("always with someone following rain trails, always with amber passed"). Stock metaphors ("haggard awe," "wryly earnest") are repeated without fresh embodiment. The vortex sequence summarizes rather than dramatizes the convergence of memories, dulling immediacy at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose carries high figurative density with mixed success: "bright darkness" and "steadily unpredictable" are oxymoronic labels rather than embodied images. Template cadence appears in the second paragraph ("echoes...reverberated," "formation-filled chambers, evidence of his recent arrival") and again in abstract mystical strings ("not through possession but through invitation," "potentiality and actuality"). Paraphrase loops: "overlapping shadows" recurs five times, "unseen forces" four times, often restating function rather than advancing it. No major grammar breaks, but information density is diluted by synonym churn and scaffolding phrases ("the irony wasn't lost on her," "fascinated her").

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no major paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. Information density is moderate; many lines advance setting or theme without propelling action. Stock metaphors recur: "sunlight breaking through clouds after persistent rain," "wave of recognition," "find its way home" lean generic. The phrase "navigated absences" appears five times, shifting from concept to motif, but the repetition borders on churn without fresh inflection each time. Figurative language in the opening ("ocean-spray archivist," "slumped shoulders and weary gait of people who had carried absence across seas") clusters densely, then thins, creating uneven texture. No loops obscure causality, but scaffold phrases like "years measured not by presence but by what was missing" and "the possibility of what might one day fill it" pad without momentum gain.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "arrows led" / "arrows ahead glowed" / "arrows stopped" / "arrows faded"; "phantom ticket punch" recycled six times with synonym churn ("clutched," "warmed," "vibrated," "dissolved"). Template cadence in opening third: "His breath frosted as he traced... His analytically artistic mind saw... He clutched... He'd mapped... He dared..." (−0.6). Stock metaphors: "shroud," "needles of judgment," "hall of mirrors." Figurative density in most sentences without payoff (−0.4). Artifacts touch closure (punch "dissolved into mist"): cumulative −1.7 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure creates visual flow. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "magic square tile" named six times with decorative variation; "entangled memories," "forgotten patterns," "unheard symphony" churn through synonym strings without added pressure. The final paragraph restates closure assertions twice ("a little less heavy" → "woven into fabric of peace"). Template cadence in the ending ("The magic square tile's lesson was complete… She smiled… stepped out…") and elevated figurative density in the memory-cascade beat ("cascade of light and sound," "palpable chorus," "swelling symphony") dull momentum. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs that touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.1)
    Figurative density is extreme and sustained without pattern-teaching or payoff: "silent, beautiful violence," "hushed thunder," "origami collapse," "poignant knife twist," "delicious, terrifying treason" cluster in peak beats, obscuring causality (−0.7). Paraphrase loops abound: "The spatial mutiny was over" / "The spatial mutiny's legacy" and "the amulet fragment waited" / "The amulet, its curiosity sated" restate without advancing (−0.4). Template cadence appears in the final third: "The spatial mutiny was over… / The amulet… / The hushed thunder…" (−0.5). One stray character ("安静") breaks immersion. Clarity at closure is significantly dulled by metaphor stack and synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and moves efficiently; no major loops or scaffold. Two moments show slight template cadence: "Unlike him, she was honest, brutally so, which had made her childhood difficult and her adulthood even harder" and the exposition block opening paragraph stack similar "father/inheritance/legacy" restatements. Figurative language is controlled except "deathly vitality" appears three times without evolving meaning, and "liquefied rigid thinking" as metaphor for the ink's effect is told rather than shown in the guard's behavior (he simply becomes "vacant" with no micro-moment of thought-shift). Information density is generally high; no significant artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images anchor well. Information density is high in the ritual description, but the piece carries paraphrase loops ("invented histories… greatest artistry… transform… embedding," then "invented histories… his answer… textures of their lives remained accessible") and template stems across expository middle paragraphs ("The stationer's work was driven…" / "Silas worked methodically…"). Stock metaphors cluster: "quiet revolution," "inner fire," "history itself burned." Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was driven," "were his greatest artistry") dull immediacy in several beats. No causality break, but momentum sags mid-passage under scaffolding weight.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("Each container was a monolith, its rusted surface a distorted mirror of the gray sky"). Midpoint scaffolding emerges: "The memory of a docker...became the cause. A young woman's tearful phone call...became the reason. The porter's grumbled prophecy...became the final destination" uses identical syntactic stems across three adjacent lines, triggering template-cadence penalty (−0.4). The final paragraph leans on summary ("he would keep collecting, keep layering") rather than concrete image, flattening propulsion. No paraphrase loops or stock metaphors touch closure, so penalty remains capped at −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and no major grammatical errors. Some overwriting appears in philosophical beats: "universal riddle that had plagued philosophers and scientists for centuries" and "whisper of closing pages" (repeated three times) edge toward portentous abstraction. Minor paraphrase loop between "retell" and "re-imagine" in adjacent paragraphs. The compass device requires multiple explanatory clauses that slow momentum. Closure beats are clean, avoiding the heaviest artifacts. Information density is moderate—several sentences do double duty (seashell warmth + pointing shift) but philosophical exposition occasionally substitutes for concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong sensory detail. Opening and closing images bookend effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "reorganize the scattered pockets of resistance into something coherent" closely echoes "reorganization accelerated" without added pressure; "dual allegiance tore at her" is restated as "dual allegiance evolved" with minimal dramatization between. Template cadence in the graffiti-spread paragraph ("Performers received…mechanics learned…elders found") stacks parallel structures without variation. Stock metaphor "lapping at their borders" and "float through storms" reduce originality. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is adequate and major beats advance. However, the piece carries multiple artifact patterns: "purposefully curious," "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain," and "dawning hush" / "dawnlit melancholy" recur as labels across beats without reweighting; paraphrase loops appear (paragraphs 2–3 repeat the grain's significance; paragraphs 6–7 restate that prior inspectors failed). Template cadence is visible in middle sections with repeated sentence stems. The chemical mechanism is introduced mid-story and explained in summary rather than shown through embodied action. Figurative phrases like "dying colors of Earth's companion" elevate register without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is maintained. However, template cadence recurs across multiple beats: "The drone's [X], [detail]" and "Elias [verb], [description]" structures proliferate. Paraphrase loops are visible: "The mist outside thickened, but inside, Elias' world was clear" echoes "The depot's mist coated the rails once more, but inside, there was only clarity." Stock metaphors ("his fingers dancing over," "a magnetic calm," "a symphony of repaired things") appear in high-density clusters without fresh specificity. The closure beat carries figurative language ("his artistry immortalized," "a map for the future") that abstracts rather than grounds the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "The worrying tranquility...had increased" / "worrying tranquility had transformed"; "condensation patterns began fading...their ephemeral nature a reminder"; "subtle confidence" and "with the subtlety of his confidence" recur without added pressure. Stock metaphors populate peak moments: "force of a breaking dam," "fallen leaves," "calm before discovery." The figurative language in the closure paragraph ("rivers were waiting to reveal their true origins") tilts toward elevated abstraction rather than concrete embodiment. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; −0.4 for stock metaphors in peak beats. Total deduction ~−1.0, yielding 6.8.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative density is high and often stacks without purpose: "windows hollow eyes and doors agape in silent screams," "darkness drinking light as if thirsty," "weaving a tapestry of sound that stitched wounds shut." Many beats use template cadence ("He paused, lifting... He stepped through... He began to walk... He reached..."). Paraphrase loops appear: "the tuner stepped through" followed by "he began to walk"; "the town was alive again" restated as "a new town was born." The closure paragraph repeats "infinitely patient" and recycles "archway," "sigils," "rhythm," and "cobblestones" without added pressure. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−0.8) and template-cadence penalty (−0.5); total line debt disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "gathered hush" recurs six times without functional variation; "crystal perfume vial" appears in eight paragraphs, often restating its warmth or iridescence without advancing action. Template cadence dominates the middle section: "The crystal perfume vial touches...," "As time runs short...," "The gathered hush [verb]..." Stock metaphors ("weight pressing against consciousness," "shadows dance") and elevated diction ("fragmentary thoughts," "ephemeral energies") clash with the POV's lack of scientific or mystical grounding. Line-level artifacts touch multiple beats but do not obscure the final image's basic sense, so deductions remain in Q7 only. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops (−0.6), template cadence across three+ sentences (−0.5), stock metaphor strings (−0.3) = baseline ~−1.4 in Q7, with artifacts spread across the second half triggering the artifact-in-final-third cap (disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8).

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "chase hush" appears three times, "narrow door left ajar for decades" twice, "threading labyrinths" twice, and "sustain impossibilities" twice without significant reweighting. The clause "copperlight repose" recurs as title-phrase decoration. Mid-paragraph in graf four, "the scent of salt and regret" and "copperlight repose enveloped him" veer into stock lyricism. Sentence openings show variety. Minor template cadence in graf two: "Through those scuffed patterns… The convicts whispered… Elias placed…"

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings. However, overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "shimmer," "luminous," "phosphorescence," "translucent," "ephemeral," "spectral," "trembling light" crowd the orchard sequence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("her form as faint as the lace of a bride's veil torn by time" / "a bride of mist and sorrow"; "the bead in her grip hummed" / "the bead glowed brighter"). Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" and "He [verb]" constructions in the reunion beat. Stock metaphors ("love a knife," "tears… rivers of starlight," "wrap around his heart like a final, lingering kiss") dull immediacy at closure. Figurative density in the final third disallows 9+ globally and applies −1.2 in Q7 for overwriting and loops touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "colossal ruin where the previous inhabitants had woven tapestries from river reeds and moonlight" and "sew through air itself" layer metaphor without clarity. Paraphrase loop in paragraph four: "broke all precedents" is immediately restated as "impossible flowers finding purchase in impossible ruins." Template cadence: "The emptiness had drawn her… The storybook illustration plate… The labyrinth had been carved…" across three consecutive paragraphs. Figurative density (slivered moon, internal organs, orchids blooming in mind's eye, air thickening) appears in most sentences of the climax without grounding action. Information density is moderate; several scaffold lines ("something that had never been done here") rephrase prior content. The final image is vivid but the prose artifacts touching closure prevent clean high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Sensory details (damp earth, ghost-white trees, cool limestone) anchor effectively. However, paraphrase loops recur: "interrupted journeys" appears three times with near-identical phrasing; "warmly curious" and "cautious enchantment" are asserted then restated. Overwriting in the closure beat: "It wasn't a grand, overwhelming epiphany, but a gentle warming within her chest, the knowledge that she could rebuild more than just stone; she could rebuild connection" stacks modifiers and tells rather than shows the shift. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("Her grandmother's flight… her father's endless waiting… her own return—it all funneled") that mechanically lists rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: nine consecutive paragraphs open with "The" or "Elliot," and key concepts (ebony clipboard, golden arcade, codes in children's sidewalk chalk, surface mail, carefully inventive, juxtapose, discover meaning) recur in near-identical phrasings across multiple beats without added pressure. "Elliot was a pseudonym creator" appears identically in two paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks ("would juxtapose," "would fade," "might wonder") and synonym churn ("careful invention," "carefully inventive," "carefully crafted") dull momentum. Applying scaffold penalties: baseline −1.0 in Q7 for pervasive loops, and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe template-cadence debt: runs of "The [noun] [verb]" openings across a dozen sentences, plus paraphrase loops ("conspiracies unraveling," "conspiracies unraveled," "conspiracies collapsed"). Stock metaphors pervade ("threads of fate," "tapestry of lies," "web no one else could see"). Filter-verb stacks in the final third ("seemed to sigh," "seemed to deepen") dull immediacy. Applied penalties: template cadence −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, stock metaphor strings −0.5, filter stacks touching closure −0.5, total line debt −2.0 with disallow-9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.1)
    Density is low: multiple sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation ("The singing spirits harmonized… as if encouraging her quest" / "The singing spirits crescendoed, their song now a fierce tenderness, urging her forward"). Template cadence appears in the shard's beats: "The shard began to pulse… The shard glowed… The shard warmed again… she held the shard aloft." Stock mystical phrasing ("older than memory," "fierce tenderness" repeated) and filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she stepped," "she pressed") dull immediacy. Paraphrase loop in the final two paragraphs: peace/release/closure restated without new detail.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several lines do double work (coral fragment as talisman and anxiety tracker), but overwriting clusters in the opening third: "funeral shrouds," "twilight's tears," "fossilized promise," "lotus-hearted ache" stack figurative language without pattern payoff, reducing clarity. Paraphrase loops appear ("the anesthetic had finally kicked in, turning the throbbing ache...into a distant, underwater echo" followed by "the anesthetic was wearing off, the pain...returning") and "shared anxiety" / "lotus-hearted ache" recur as near-synonyms. Template cadence in the middle paragraph: "He'd come here...but instead he'd found..." followed by "he hadn't just unknot...he'd unknot..." creates rhythmic monotony. The closure beat ("smiled, a small, tentative thing") is clean, limiting total artifact penalty, but figurative density in the opening and loops mid-text prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, mild scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "Her smile was one of pensive mirth; the process was always a gamble" closely echoes the earlier descriptor, and "pensive mirth" recurs three times without charged reweighting. Figurative language is dense ("exposed film," "chemical emulsions," "conduits for feeling") but remains coherent. Register is elevated and consistent. No major clarity breaks, but the final paragraph over-explains ("a reminder that even things lost...") where image alone would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("tendrils of melody curled like vines"), but clustering in the garden sequence risks overwriting—nearly every sentence carries metaphor without causal propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "The garden was gone, but its sound lived on, nested within her" closely restates the prior conceptual claim. Template cadence emerges in the "awakening" announcements, which mechanically label rather than dramatize progression. Sentence-level clarity is generally high, but information density drops during the metaphor-heavy garden beats. No major grammar or continuity errors; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The elevated diction in peak beats occasionally drifts from embodied action into abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high and action sequences track, but line-level artifacts permeate: paraphrase loops ("the chaos of nature obscuring the rebellion beneath" / "converging chaos was closing in"), template cadence ("He called himself Silas, though the name was…" / "He strode past…" / "He produced…"), stock metaphors ("fireflies in a jar," "spark"). Purple prose clusters in descriptive beats ("iridescent shells frozen mid-scuttle," "leaves like cracked green shields") without adding pressure. The phrase "candidly cryptic" is self-contradictory. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("the real rebellion was in the spaces between the words") tells rather than shows. These artifacts touch the closure beat (final two paragraphs), triggering the elevated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence and synonym churn pervade: "he had outlived kingdoms, watched empires rise and fall," "pain wasn't something to be erased but something to be transformed," "each one a testament to the beauty that arose from longing." Paraphrase loops recur—"the blossom armistice" and its variants appear five times, restating the same concept without added pressure. Figurative density in most sentences ("ink swirling like nebulae," "pearlescent walls humming," "reef-shadow joy") without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers overwriting penalties. Stock metaphors ("pain bloomed into constellations," "his heart full of the joy") and filter-verb stacks in the final third ("he found," "he knew," "he continued") dull immediacy. The final paragraph's artifact concentration—template stems, abstract labels, thematic summary—disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating texture that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "the caretaker's motivation was singular and solemn" is restated conceptually in later paragraphs without new detail. Template cadence is visible in repeated "The caretaker [verb]" stems across the second half. Stock phrases ("poison-sweet," "spun sugar," "threadbare tapestry") appear in close succession. Clarity is maintained, but information density is low; many sentences elaborate mood rather than advance situation. No outright loops touch the closure beat, limiting the penalty, but pervasive scaffold and decorative phrasing lower the score significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and free of glaring typos, but suffers from pervasive scaffold and paraphrase loops. Multiple sentences restate the same idea: "The symphonies of truth hummed softly" / "The symphonies of truth had guided them" / "The symphonies of truth hummed their approval." Template cadence dominates the final third with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("liquid starlight," "tapestry of redemption") and therapy-speak labels ("I promise to listen without defense") cluster in high-pressure beats. Line-level momentum stalls under decorative recurrence rather than advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "encrypted compassion" appears six times, "slyly heartfelt" twice, "dappled resolve" twice, "the building breathed" / "amphitheater's breath" / "building's breathing" cycles without fresh meaning. Template cadence: "He [verb], [noun] [verb]" structures dominate. Mixed metaphor: "dust like forgotten confetti" clashes with geothermal setting. Figurative density in non-peak beats ("chain coiled like a serpent," "thirst is a blade," "heart buoyed by dappled resolve") creates texture without clarity. Proximity check: "building breathes" echoes well-worn personification without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the attic description and ritual beats. However, several lines loop conceptually: "everything left a trail" is restated in the dust-mote observation without added pressure, and "The paper trail was now writ across the continent, a living line of flight" paraphrases the prior image. The phrase "blooming, withering" recurs effectively as motif but "blooming like wildfire flowers" mixed with "withering star" creates a slight vehicle clash (flowers ≠ stars). Minor overwriting in "desperate, beautiful act of preservation" and "the ghost of pipe tobacco" nudges toward stock atmospheric descriptors. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs that would trigger heavier penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "necessary distances" and "sacred thresholds" cycle across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("Elea [verb], [object]") appear in five consecutive beats. Stock metaphors ("water disturbed by stones," "invisible threads") and filter-verb stacks ("could feel," "could hear," "swore she could hear") dull immediacy in peak moments. The final third recycles "featherly determined" and "fractured hush" without fresh propulsion, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "luminous respite Elara had sought wasn't peace from her work but understanding her place" is immediately restated as "the rhythm of belonging wasn't discovered but created" and again as "Elara had been searching for how she belonged, never understanding that belonging wasn't discovered." Template cadence appears in the 3:17 AM and 4:52 AM timestamp beats, which function as scaffolding rather than pressure. Stock metaphor: "hearts and minds across time" and "dance of light that spanned from seafloor to surface and beyond." Filter-verb stack: "had been," "had sought," "had come," "had just begun" across multiple lines. Apply −0.9 for loops and cadence artifacts touching the closure paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and clarity is maintained throughout. Several paraphrase loops appear: "emotional imprints" → "emotional history" → "emotional puzzle" within adjacent paragraphs, and "disappeared"/"disappearing paths" recurs in near-identical phrasing across multiple lines. Template cadence is mild: "She picked up… feeling… turning" → "She positioned… held… eyes trained" → "She watched… followed." Stock metaphors cluster in the closure beat ("threads from the tapestry of memory," "gaps that spread like disease"), dulling the final image. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work (color meanings), but scaffolding is present ("Today might be the day"). No severe opacity, but polish is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong imagery ("breath curling like smoke," "shattered-glass eyes"). However, multiple decorative metaphors cluster in descriptive beats without advancing pressure: "bruised with constellations," "silver" music threading, "dying star" lamplight. Paraphrase loops appear: the bishop is "secret accomplice" then "silent orchestrator," "carefully curated serendipity" echoes "orchestrated chaos." The final paragraph stacks summary lines ("The night was young," "creativity...waited for no one," "his next move was already in motion") that dilute closure momentum rather than landing a concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "gaps between what was known" / "spaces between constellations" / "immense spaces between particles" recycle the same conceptual note without adding pressure. Template cadence clusters: "Her movements drew... from starlight, from the gaps... from the immense spaces" stacks prepositions mechanically. Stock metaphors: "obsidian grace—sharp, elegant, absolute" is decorative rather than precise. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("began forming," "began to loosen") dull immediacy (−0.9 cumulative for loops, cadence, and stacks). Textual artifact disallows 9+ globally per the rule.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("second spine," "prism atrium in mist," "overgrown thoughts," "greedy light," "noctilucent reckonings"), creating density without propulsion—most images do not advance character or stakes. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "before everything shifts" recurs four times without variation; the final five paragraphs restate the same thesis (value in simplicity, light as metaphor) across different sentence stems. Typo "thepond's" and missing spaces ("toerglass," "panewould") indicate proofreading lapses. Template cadence: "The [ordinal] ring [verb]" structure repeats seven times consecutively, flattening rhythm during the central communion sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear, but figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "ink spilled across parchment," "constellation of burn scars," "topographic lines of trauma," "hard softness of his character" cluster in the opening third. The final paragraph loops thematically ("born from… born from… born from") and moralizes rather than propelling. Template cadence appears in "The cracked box wasn't just… but…" and "not because… but because…" constructions. Minor filter-verb stacks ("began to reflect," "started to understand") dull immediacy in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "patterns… patterns she'd made… patterns aligning… patterns emerge… patterns converging… patterns in stone… patterns she'd found." Sentence stems repeat mechanically ("She adjusted… She closed… She reached… She turned"). The final third stacks summary statements without propulsion ("The logical dreamer had done her work, and the world would never be the same" followed by three more declarative paragraphs). Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she saw," "she sensed," "she knew") dull immediacy in the closing beats, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "half-burned diaries… edges singed but ink miraculously legible" restates within two lines; "sensitively perceptive" appears twice in distinct phrasings without added pressure. Template stems recur ("he'd heard," "he'd found," "he realized") across adjacent sentences. Figurative language stacks at closure ("ivy rustling like distant applause," "fluttered in his mind's eye," "legacy's burden was not weight—he was direction") without coherent vehicle. Apply −1.0 for loops and stems, −0.4 for mixed metaphor density at closure: total −1.4, capping mid-4s.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythm varies purposefully, with strong sensory anchors and minimal grammatical slips. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops ("elusive in reputation, though not by choice" / "elusive not by intention but by necessity"), template cadence in the third paragraph ("She began to hum… a method she had developed… Each note carried…"), and filter-verb stacks ("she could feel," "could persuade"). These artifacts cluster in expository beats rather than the closure, limiting the deduction to mid-band penalty (−0.6 in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "operatively gentle" is repeated across beats without functional shift; "the slow dance of celestial bodies" recurs identically; "anchor ideals in practice" is stated twice in near-identical phrasing. Figurative language density is high throughout ("ledger of his failures," "cathedral of redemption," "dance as eternal as the stars") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, creating mild overwriting in non-peak beats. Information density is moderate—many lines restate concepts (gentleness, redemption, the ritual's significance) rather than advancing situation or choice. These artifacts dull momentum and prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe template cadence across opening beats: "The manufactured drought...The distant thunder...The egg trembled...His staff believed...The lull of thunder...The drought had been...The fractured beauty...WithSettings calibrated..." constitutes a run of subject-verb declarative stems with minimal syntactic variety. The 平整 character and "hisActions" and "WithSettings" are copy artifacts that obscure clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "fractured grace" occurs three times, "echo of extinction" twice, "manufactured drought" three times without evolving meaning. Information density is low—many sentences restate Silas's contradiction without advancing situation. Figurative language is stacked without pattern-teaching: "warm as forgotten sunlight," "ghost image shimmering," "molecules converted to resonance waves." These artifacts measurably dull momentum and touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5 for density in peak beats). Mixed metaphors: "crystals beneath her bare feet feared to shatter" anthropomorphizes snow, then "the harvest of echoes was not sound but memory—fragments… trapped like fireflies" shifts vehicle mid-image. Paraphrase loops: "she was still a chaste courtesan, still a paradox, but now she was whole" restates the closure twice in one paragraph. Template cadence: "She was X. She was Y. She was Z" runs through multiple beats. Scaffold phrasing ("the night was quiet, but she was no longer alone") summarizes rather than shows the closure image. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "half-lit, incomplete yet illuminating" / "half-lit epiphanies"; "uncommonly serene" appears twice in identical phrasing bookending the story. Template cadence runs ("Elias set down… walked to… Among them rose…") appear in the second paragraph without pattern payoff. The phrase "campfire story stick" recurs eight times, often in decorative mentions that add no new information. Figurative density ("like dawn filtering through dust motes," "darkness descended like a velvet curtain," "meteor hush") clusters without grounding in POV-specific perception, triggering overwriting penalties of −0.6. Multiple scaffold phrases ("his practiced grace," "his serenity undisturbed") recur without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and largely coherent ("sky-bound oasis," "stuttering flame"), but the final third stacks synonym loops and conceptual restatements: "temporary structure," "transiently rooted," "interrupted cadence," and "fleeting things" recur without added pressure or detail. Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines ("The grotto would remain… its memory of the woven arch and the moth wing as transient as the monarchs themselves" followed by "The moth wing, its brief service done, was now just a memory dissolving"). Template cadence is evident in repeated sentence stems ("Elias did not…," "The piece…," "He knew…"). Information density drops in the final paragraphs as the prose circles thematic assertions rather than advancing image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "preserve their echoes" / "preserve the sound"; "lost, erased, ones who had never been carved" cycles synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the final third with uniform clause structure. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats: "river of memory," "frost in spring," "silk," "snowmelt ardor" as convenient abstraction. Filter-verb stack: "felt the last remnants dissolve," "believed his work was," "understood: it was to listen" dulls immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are concise, varied in structure, and propulsive ("Touching it would only accelerate its decay. Repair was futile"). Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, world, or pressure. Two minor frictions: the phrase "ethereal realm gritting with corrupted data" mixes registers (ethereal/grit/data) in a way that slightly muddies the metaphor, and "an hour ago" in "having witnessed the violent cascade in a dream an hour ago" introduces a time anchor that feels overly precise for Kael's fluid temporal experience. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; the opening and closing lines are purposeful and imagistic. Figurative language (e.g., "the echo of a lost directive") enhances rather than obscures.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully and figurative language is mostly coherent, though density is uneven—long stretches of atmospheric setup without propulsive action. The piece contains minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "encrypted devotion" and "covenant with the unknown" restated across multiple lines without added pressure; the final two paragraphs recycle thematic claims). Template stems appear in the closing sequence: "The palace stood silent... The encrypted devotion was now... The palace reimagined would crumble..." Stock phrasing like "not of fear, but of alignment" and "the calm of a man who had courted the cosmos and won" reduce specificity. No artifacts obscure causality at closure, capping deductions at −0.8 per the artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "release their burdens" / "releasing resentment," "shifted around him" / "reality shifts around them," "reappeared in his pocket" (five times with minimal variation). Template cadence dominates—"Each carried...Each initially resisted...Each was eventually convinced"—across three consecutive sentences. Stock metaphors ("weight of a betrayal," "tears cascaded") and therapy-speak ("cellular memory," "emotional release") accumulate without fresh specificity. Figurative language in the opening paragraph ("waves in a pond," "stone and mist") adds density without clarity or payoff. The final third recycles prior phrasing ("soundless sanctuary," "shifting grace," "broken cylinder pin") in summary rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening grounds, peak lifts without obscuring sense. Minor loops present: "boundaries between" appears three times in paragraph one, and "the mirror maker" substitutes for "Elian" mechanically in later paragraphs (synonym churn). "Shimmer" recurs (twilight frost, glass mountains) without clear pattern payoff. Information density is high; no dead scaffolding. Figurative language (fog like ghosts, bird with prism wings) remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is solid (ribbon, seed, key, candle each carry dual freight as relic and symbol). Clarity is high, with no spatial confusion. However, template cadence appears in repetitive sentence stems ("The mender [verb]" × 5 times; "She had always [verb]" × 2) and synonym loops recur around "breach" and "promise." Figurative language clusters heavily ("leafy sea," "dappled rivers," "whispers brushing cheeks") without clear pattern-teaching, pushing toward overwriting in the opening third. The closure beat is clean, so non-closure artifacts trigger −0.6 total within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from template cadence and paraphrase loops throughout. "Simply complicated" appears six times across the text, shifting from descriptor to empty intensifier. Runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "Margaret [verb]" stems flatten rhythm. The final paragraph restates the entire premise in summary mode: "nonlinear inheritance wasn't a curse or a gift but simply complicated existence itself—full of beauty, terror, and lonely asteroids blossoming with impossible fruit" recycles prior content without advancing it. Mixed metaphors ("brightened disquiet," "disquiet...brightened") and stock constructions ("Between the first and last page") appear in peak beats, dulling the closure image. Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, template cadence, and stock phrasing touching the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, concept, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm supports the arc. However, several ornamental constructions slow momentum: "a mosaic of pressed, silent leaves that smelled of forgotten seasons" frontloads atmosphere over function, and "the scent of aging paper and dust, a scent that felt like an unheard symphony magnified to a deafening volume" is a near-paraphrase loop (scent restated with metaphor). "Spidery script," "sheer scale consumed those who wandered," and "absolute stillness" are stock phrases. The peak beat (Elara's renegotiation) is clear and propulsive, but earlier exposition (the diary's seven plants, the author as "a previous victim") feels scaffold-heavy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase/stock elements that dull the opening and middle without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "unkindled solace" appears six times with minimal reweighting, "narrative threads" and "trapped freedom" recur as labels without evolving function. Template cadence dominates the second half: "The twin [verb], [object]" structures repeat across a dozen sentences without pattern-taught purpose. Stock metaphors ("flickered like dying stars," "curled around") dull specificity. The final third carries heavy scaffold: "And in that moment, they understood" and "The story was theirs now" are thesis statements that stall momentum. Minimal artifact penalty (−0.8) applied in Q7 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap; closure beat itself is not exempted but the summary mode extends through it.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose carries vivid images ("void stitched from threads of starlight," "braids shimmering with hues that defied color") but density issues emerge. Paraphrase loops appear: "this was a bridge between what was and what wasn't" immediately followed by "allowing the library's lost stories to rejoin the world" restates the same idea. Figurative language clusters heavily in the void/library passage without always advancing cause/effect ("candle flame for a title" is atmospheric but unexplained). The final paragraph stacks summary ("his work was just beginning—there were other doors") that dilutes momentum. Template cadence runs appear: "stepped through... found himself... traced... understood" follows a mechanical verb-chain pattern across adjacent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose carries vivid images (cracks like rivers, northern lights given voice) and clear action sequencing, but suffers from pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops. Runs of "The [noun]" sentence stems across the final third create drumbeat rhythm: "The bloom of hush would fade... The energy beings lingered... The echo chamber stone warmed... The ripple-mark mapkeeper continued..." Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines ("quiet," "stillness," "hush," "peace," "silence") without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("eye of the hurricane," "temple of silence") reduce specificity. The final paragraph alone contains six "The [noun] [verb]" constructions that dull momentum and obscure whether new information is advancing. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically controlled, but figurative density crowds high-pressure beats: "thistle-blown hope," "shard of hush," "cloak woven from starlight and silence" appear in rapid succession without breathing room. Several phrases loop conceptually—"retrocognitively blessed" recurs four times across eight hundred words, and "the ancient astronomers" / "ancient builders" cycle through synonym churn. The "shard of hush" metaphor is strained: silence is described as "absorbing the sound of millions ending at once," then "released…not as emptiness but as power"—mixing incompatible physics. Template cadence appears in the opening: "his bare feet knowing," "his retrocognitive blessing had shown," "his hands to keep." Information density is moderate; some sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are evident: "preemptively nostalgic" appears in lines 11, 17, 23, and 26 with minimal variation in function. Template cadence: "The forecourt hummed… and he knelt… his mind weaving" / "The shadows stretched… and as he measured… he realized" / "He stood… his gaze sweeping… where the crystal whispers intensified." Information density is moderate; several beats restate Kael's dedication without advancing pressure. High figurative load ("ink into parchment," "tapestry of identity," "mantle," "sentinel of time") in non-peak description dilutes specificity. Clarity remains intact; no grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and rhythm. However, several lines paraphrase adjacent content: "dangerous yet beautiful, destructive yet enlightening" echoes "serious playfulness"; the final two paragraphs restate the mosaic's message in near-synonym loops. Template cadence appears in paired clauses ("not…but rather," "literal or metaphorical"). Stock metaphors ("gravity of hopelessness," "canvas above") and elevated diction ("ambient awareness," "centrifugal force") elevate register without adding embodied pressure. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative loops and scaffold dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character interiority, or thematic layering. Rhythm varies purposefully between longer contemplative sentences and shorter beats. Some lines approach overwriting: "pooled like liquid thought," "thin moonlight over water's surface," and "vast indifferent night" stack metaphorical language densely in adjacent beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering minor figurative muddle (−0.3). A few scaffold phrases appear: "minutes ago" and "at last" function as temporal markers without adding pressure. Clarity remains strong overall, with no loops or coherence breaks. Sentence openings vary adequately, though several begin with "Elian" or "The" in close succession mid-passage.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.6)
    Multiple prose artifacts appear throughout: paraphrase loops ("the silence that answered was sweeter than any song" after "only she could conduct"), template cadence in the final third (repeated "The doll…" and "Elara…" stems), and stock metaphors ("river stones," "falling star," "closing door"). Figurative density is high in peak beats without cumulative payoff—"gilded hush," "intangibly tangible," "xenial trellis" are recycled rather than developed. Information density is low; many sentences restate Elara's success or the doll's mystery without advancing situation. The opening and closing lines carry lyric charge, but scaffold phrasing dulls momentum in the middle third. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −0.8 for loops and template cadence; artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn dominate the final third: "work was done" / "purpose fulfilled" / "purpose served"; "quiet lingered" / "quiet remained" / "silence was kind"; "vial was clear" / "vial was still" repeated four times across seven paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "The terrace would remember. / The vial was still. / The silence was kind. / And Elara was content." Stock metaphor ("like a lullaby") and the phrase "fluidly logical" recurs three times without variation. Clarity remains intact but momentum flatlines under the weight of repetition. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the lower-band penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean but exhibits template cadence and repetitive sentence openings ("The ruby flake..." appears multiple times; "As the..." opens several paragraphs). Information density is uneven—some beats compress well while others paraphrase the same concept across adjacent sentences (e.g., the throne's unclaimed status restated multiple times). Stock metaphors ("heart raced," "precious minutes fading") appear in peak moments without fresh embodiment. The final third drifts into summary loops that restate the thematic premise.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening and middle carries figurative language ("memory like breath holds air," "stained glass and scripture," "necrotic tissue," "smoke in wind"), creating density without corresponding pressure increase. Paraphrase loops appear: "teach suffocating things how to breathe" is restated in the final paragraph as "to teach something how to breathe, you must first risk being unable to breathe yourself." Template cadence runs through the backstory section ("She burned bridges carefully," "Each connection severed," "phantom pains still visited"). Mixed metaphor: "loaded emptiness…cultivated like a rare orchid" conflates weight, absence, and horticultural care without coherent vehicle. The closure beat is dulled by abstract exposition rather than concrete action or image. These artifacts touch the closure, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm. Minor issues: "the ache in his chest, the years of debt and regret" is near-summary; "a forest of glowing caps that pulsed" and "the mushrooms brightened" repeat the glow motif without functional variation. "Virtuously mischievous" appears twice as a descriptor without dramatized meaning. Stock phrases like "a testament to his survival" and "turn pain into purpose" reduce specificity. No major loops or causality breaks, but scaffolding ("not just physically, but existently") pads without adding pressure. Line-level craft is serviceable but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice effectively. Information density is uneven: many sentences layer atmosphere without advancing plot (e.g., "the first yawn of evening deepened, and the shadows stretched longer, as if reaching for something just beyond their grasp"). Paraphrase loops appear ("the hidden truth was not in the books but in the vibrations themselves" / "the hidden truth revealed itself") and the closure paragraph summarizes rather than showing a decisive image. Template cadence with "Elias [verb]" stems recurs frequently, dulling propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.6)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "capture the shape of possibility, to see what could be before it wasn't" restates the same idea; "murmured allegiance" repeats five times with synonym churn (whisper, promise, declaration). Template cadence dominates the final third with "The knight [verb]" stems across consecutive sentences (−0.4 to −0.6). Stock metaphors pile without clarity: "time stretching like taffy," "magic spread like wildfire," "light catching the new sun." Filter-verb stacks ("felt the pull," "felt the weight," "felt foreign") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.5, disallowing 9+ globally). Information density is low; many sentences restate prior claims without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies, information density is high, and spatial choreography tracks clearly. One typo/artifact ("листing") and one minor paraphrase loop ("small kindness...small, profound current") slightly dull momentum. Figurative language is mostly controlled, but "universe of untold joy and sorrow" and "pebble into the ocean" approach stock metaphor territory without fresh specificity. Propulsion is steady; no major scaffold or template cadence appears. The artifacts are clustered early and do not touch the closure beat, limiting deduction to −0.3 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose demonstrates solid technical control with varied sentence structure and clear action sequencing. However, pervasive overwriting dulls immediacy: "weathered logo," "unassuming maintenance worker," "underestimated rebel," "cognitive erosion," "carefully resourceful beyond measure," "masterpiece of propaganda" stack modifiers and abstract labels where concrete action would sharpen pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "Most saw her as merely an unassuming maintenance worker, but Maya was an underestimated rebel" and "most citizens shrugged, accepted the changes, and moved on, but Maya had dedicated her life to holding the line" follow identical syntactic templates. The phrase "carefully resourceful beyond measure" exemplifies forced intensification. Filter verbs ("she observed," "she spotted," "she knew") cluster in high-pressure beats, adding distance. The closing two paragraphs loop thematic summary ("seeds of doubt," "memories of how things once were") rather than trusting the broadcast image to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with strong images (dewdrops as prisms, music fractured into colored beams). However, several artifacts flatten momentum: "vested hush" and "quietly vivid" appear multiple times without evolving meaning; "dewdrops formed" recurs in near-identical phrasing across opening, middle, and close; and elevated constructions ("destabilize the harmony," "nested puzzle wrapped in his melodies") read as thesaurus choices rather than earned voice. The opening and closing thirds lean on reflective summary that paraphrases earlier content ("To protect his town, he had to create music designed to be forgotten" restates the core premise without advancing it). Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt the shift," "thought about the composer," "considered the peculiar nature") dull immediacy in key beats. The climax—"Success"—is a one-word declaration that summarizes rather than enacts. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "Each occurrence sent… / This morning was critical… / He began to play…" No loops severe enough to obscure causality, but cumulative density loss in peak beats merits deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. "Something emerges transformed always" appears five times with minimal variation. Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "The moonstone dust wasn't just a memory keeper; it was a bridge" immediately followed by explanation of that bridge. Runs of identical stems ("Another revealed," "A third speck drifted") span multiple sentences in the climax, triggering −0.6 for template cadence. Figurative language is dense but muddy: "mossy delight" is a synesthetic leap that contradicts the established ashen-silver-light palette, and "eyes that held entire galaxies" is a stock image. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("His purpose transformed alongside the dust"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid, but several prose artifacts dull momentum. The phrase "uncertainly certain" appears twice as a conceptual tag without embodied demonstration, and the final third stacks filter verbs and passive constructions ("was alive," "was meant to," "was full of") that flatten immediacy during what should be a high-pressure beat. Paraphrase loops appear: "He would never fix all the broken clocks, but he would learn to live with their brokenness" restates the prior decision without added pressure. The closing line's abstraction ("that was the only way to truly mend time") summarizes rather than charges through image. These patterns trigger cumulative deductions in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high ("thermos that brewed courage, a compass that pointed to unresolved grief"). However, figurative language saturates nearly every beat: "sulfur and sorrow," "swallowed by the mist," "shard of broken intention," "moth," "starlight," "map," "compass," creating cumulative metaphor load without pattern-teaching or payoff that escalates pressure. Template cadence appears in adjacent constructs: "He placed... He needed... He'd countered... He lighted... He would fuse..." Several lines paraphrase: "balance wasn't about symmetry; it was about holding opposites" restates the kintsugi concept already shown. The final third remains metaphor-dense ("luminous with regret," "taste of closure, heavy and light"), triggering −0.6 for density and −0.3 for paraphrase loops. No grammar or sequencing errors.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence proliferate: "The woman's voice rose… speaking of a life half-lived" is immediately followed by "He adjusted his tune… until a single, pure laugh escaped," then "The woman flickered… a thread of gold in her gray tapestry"; the child's beat recycles the same structure ("The collector played again… the child's confession tumbled out… he pursued that giggle… The child's form dissolved"). Stock metaphors ("ivy on stone," "gray tapestry," "thread of gold") and elevated diction ("luminous ache," "modestly fearless") repeat without variation. Runs of "The collector [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" sentence stems span 6+ consecutive lines mid-story, triggering template-cadence penalties. The final third consists almost entirely of thematic summary rather than concrete action, flattening momentum. Apply −1.2 cumulative in Q7 for loops, template cadence, and closure-adjacent summary.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in sensory passages. However, several template-cadence runs appear ("He was an enhanced interrogation survivor," "He was proprioceptively enhanced," "It was happening again," "It was a displaced rootedness") and the phrase "ultraviolet penance" recurs without dramatic variation. The equation reveal and terms like "displaced rootedness" lean abstract where concrete image would propel. Paraphrase loop: "his body had learned to adapt" adjacent to "his sense...heightened to an excruciating degree" restates the same content. Filter-verb stack ("He could feel the tilt...the subtle shift...the way his joints") in a high-pressure beat dulls immediacy. Total artifact load: −0.8 baseline, touching near-closure beats pushes penalty toward −1.0 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in descriptive beats, but several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure: "Between worlds, she thought, between childhood and now, there was only this: an eternal instant of recognition" echoes the timeframe element without new information. The phrase "elusively tangible" recurs as a stock modifier. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed (fragment "pulsed like a heartbeat" / "grew warmer" / "no longer just glass but a bridge"). Clarity remains intact, and no causality breaks occur, but momentum sags in the reflective middle section. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" constructions across adjacent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is strong with varied syntax and vivid imagery, but several beats stack metaphors without breathing room: "dust lay like a shroud," "specters of motion," "secrets pressed like flowers," "truth could begin its slow accretion" cluster in the opening third. A minor paraphrase loop appears when "weightless burden" recurs at open and close without added pressure between mentions. The final paragraph's "cold, dense weight" / "weightless burden" contrast rescues the motif, but template cadence in mid-section beats ("he stood… he didn't touch… he watched") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Several beats show paraphrase loops: "rustling awakenings" recurs as label without evolving function; "perfect systems" and "unbroken cycles" restate the same idea. The phrase "click into place with sickening clarity" is stock thriller diction. Template cadence in the final third: "He thought of... of... of... Then he pulled." Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template run (−0.4), and stock phrase (−0.3) yields cumulative −0.9, capping within-band movement and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies well with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally dense without pattern payoff: "groaned with the weight of history and the pressure of the void" stacks metaphors; "the light didn't just pass through it; it pooled, wept, and held the color" uses three verbs where two would sharpen. Minor paraphrase loop: "He would not present his findings... Instead, he would smuggle the shard... He would write poems" repeats "would" stems. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") appear frequently but fit the reflective mode. No major clarity issues; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence pervades: "His fingers…"; "The moment came when…"; "As he worked, memories flooded back…"; recycled stems flatten propulsion. Paraphrase loops: "mending what isn't torn" / "fixing the invisible rather than the broken." Figurative density in calm exposition without pattern-teaching ("springs of lapsed time," "midnight's theft," "shadow realm between worlds") applies −0.6. Stock metaphors ("fallen star with a purpose") and filter-verb stacks ("noting with satisfaction") add −0.4. Artifacts touch the ending paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies cleanly; no template cadence or loops. Information density is high: "The town mill's final whistle had blown a month prior, and since then, Elias perceived an auditory clearing" does triple work (timeframe, setting shift, perceptual signature). Figurative language is controlled and purposeful: "conversation with stone," "funneled him toward," "hinged awakening." One friction cluster in the final paragraph: "hinged awakening...door labeled 'there is a reason for everything'" is over-dense metaphor that slightly muddles clarity under peak pressure, and "brimming with inexplicable, beautiful magic" stacks three abstract modifiers where one concrete image would sharpen. Proofreading is clean; no scaffolding or synonym churn. Propulsion is strong through descent and weakens slightly at the lagoon where reflection expands.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.4)
    Heavy paraphrase loops pervade: "reimagine" appears five times, "alliances" seven, "turbine-hum reverie" three, "perpetually learning" twice, all as recycled labels rather than evolved images. Template cadence runs ("the slide wasn't just X; it was Y," "not just art, but…") flatten rhythm. Mixed metaphor: "turbine-hum reverie of the cave" conflates mechanical and meditative registers without coherent vehicle. The final third stacks scaffold sentences that summarize rather than propel. Artifacts touch closure, triggering −1.7 baseline plus disallowance of 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean but exhibits several patterns that dull momentum: repeated "Lena + [verb]" sentence openings across paragraphs, synonym loops (obsession/fixation, quest/journey), and scaffold transitions ("As spring softened," "By autumn," "When winter's first snowflakes"). The phrase "umbral tenderness" appears twice without functional reprise. Key beats are summarized rather than shown ("Her reputation... spread," "her quest led her"), reducing information density. Mixed metaphor in "fragments of her obsession" (obsession cannot be fragmented) and "belief can take root and grow" (generic plant metaphor). The overwriting is mild but pervasive, with figurative language appearing in most lines without pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rhythm varies and the opening/closing anchor effectively (floating library → library ascends). Information density is high in the lagoon descent and message exchanges. However, multiple paraphrase loops weaken propulsion: "the diary's encryption clicked… flooding his mind" immediately followed by "He knew then what he had to do"; "the truth was a tide" rephrased as "relentless, encrypted, and surprisingly tender"; the penultimate and final paragraphs restate closure implications rather than trusting the image. Template cadence appears in mid-story beats ("arranged… formed… whispered… replied"). Stock metaphor "bones to water" and "vault door" clichés dull specificity. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template runs (−0.5), and stock strings (−0.3) totals −1.0 within Q7 non-closure cap, but artifacts appear near closure ("The end? No—just another debris message") which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is adequate but momentum stalls in mid-story summary: "He conceived a schoolhouse, its walls plastered with children's drawings, and a market where no one went hungry. Each memory became a brushstroke…" is list-like and low-density. Paraphrase loops appear ("He knew the cost of indecision" / "the weight of his decisions"). The final paragraph is scaffold-heavy, recycling the creation premise without propulsion. Figurative language is functional but unvaried ("sand through his fingers," "brushstroke"). Sentence openings repeat ("Elian" appears five times in subject position across adjacent paragraphs).

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong sentence variety and information density, particularly in the opening paragraph's complex syntax. However, several template stems recur: "Elias had been," "Elias continued," "Elias made his choice," "Elias understood." The phrase "dead languages" appears three times in close proximity. Minor paraphrase loop: the second and third paragraphs both establish Elias's unique gift in similar terms. The figurative language—"languages that had ceased breathing," "promises like rare fruit"—mostly lands clearly, though "velvet disquiet" strains slightly as mixed register.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "furiously tranquil" appears three times; "borrowed time" and "vortex inheritance" cycle without added meaning. Template cadence in the opening: "She was furiously tranquil... her breath a plume... She was furiously tranquil, a state she had cultivated..." Stock metaphors ("heat of purpose," "poem of reduction") stack in high-pressure beats without specificity. Register drift into lyric abstraction ("seam of perfect darkness split the ground, expanding not outward but inward") obscures rather than clarifies the action. Information density is moderate—each sentence gestures at advancement—but scaffold phrases ("the method was far more elegant," "the texture of the borrowed time was here") delay rather than propel. Artifacts touch multiple beats but not the final syncing image, so penalties remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs: "Elian adjusted…," "Elian wiped…," "Elian approached…," "Elian activated…," "Elian made notes…," "Elian completed…," "Elian paused…" across the entire piece. Synonym churn around "sanctuary" and "systems." The phrase "favoring listening over noise" appears three times verbatim, functioning as scaffold. Stock metaphors ("coiled like a sleeping python," "sea of white below") lack fresh specificity. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate procedural completeness without advancing pressure. Final paragraph stacks filter verbs and summary.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "spiritually curious by nature, a trait that had led her to accept this isolated position" restates the setup without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She began to spend...she traced...this practice became." Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats: "beautiful, transient pain," "whispered her name in the language of light." Register drift into philosophical abstraction ("flourishing stillness," "transcended ordinary consciousness") contradicts the cosmic-janitor grounding. Figurative language appears in most sentences of key beats without earned payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports the two-beat arc. Clarity is generally strong, though several lines loop conceptually: "tangled covenant...binding agreement," "unspoken understanding...unspoken words," and "tranquilly perceptive" appears twice as a label without fresh inflection. Figurative language is dense ("impossible amber," "fractured reality," "ripple in the hive mind") but coherent within the lyric register. Minor template cadence in the opening: "existed...bloomed...survived...protected" in quick succession. No serious scaffolding or pronoun drift. Information density is moderate; some beats ("astonished gasp escaped his lips as understanding flooded") tell rather than show the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "He wasn't just a collector; he was a custodian" immediately follows the prior description; "mysteries just beginning to unfold" / "mysteries no longer distant but immediate" recycles the mystery frame. Template cadence clusters in the final third: "Elias felt… Elias closed… Elias…" Filter-verb stack ("he realized," "he felt," "he held") dulls immediacy in the journal discovery beat. Figurative language is generic ("still waters," "threads in a larger tapestry"). Applied −1.0 for loops and template runs touching the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is frequent and occasionally vivid ("scarlet vein," "captured twilight") but mixed metaphors muddle clarity ("the tide's advance slow and inexorable" while the poet remains unmoving stretches plausibility). Template-cadence runs appear: "The poet [verb]" opens five sentences in the final third. Paraphrase loops recur: "beauty in the incomplete" / "beauty lived in the margins" / "in the incomplete, the poet would find their next verse" restate the same idea across three beats without added pressure. Information density is low in the final third, where summary reflection replaces scene momentum. The closure beat is buried in philosophical summary rather than a sharp final image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean and grammatically sound with varied sentence structures. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance setting or theme, but several loop thematically without plot pressure: "copper wire… resonance… phenomenon" is restated across paragraphs, and "brazen calm" appears twice in similar phrasing. The final paragraph stacks three "how" clauses that paraphrase the same realization. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of synonym variants ("respect," "silent conversation," "relationships") and templated cadence in the closing diminish propulsion. Deduction within the −0.6 to −0.8 range for loops and thematic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (rainwashed, bronze quiet, sculpture path) is evocative. However, paraphrase loops appear: "converge here" / "converging here," "footprints marred" / "footprints remained" / "footprints glowing" / "footprints now burned" recycle the same image without advancing pressure. The final two paragraphs stack thematic restatements ("chemistry of homecoming," "alignment of elements," "pull of home") that summarize rather than propel. Stock metaphors ("as if the sky had tried to wash its secrets away," "gaping wound to the sky") and filter-verb reliance ("felt the weight," "felt more alone," "felt the pull") dull immediacy in peak beats. Aggregate penalty: −0.8 for loops and template cadence touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dense figurative language pervades without pattern-taught payoff: "narrow vastness," "submerged concord," "gloom-hill coachman" pile symbolic weight atop every beat, flattening propulsion (density penalty −0.5). Template cadence runs appear in adjacent explanatory clauses ("his motivation was clear: to let..."; "his work was not merely ecological but spiritual") that stall rather than advance (−0.4). Paraphrase loops recur: "promises between realms" / "promises kept and broken," and "the hollow expanse that mirrored the hollow in the coachman's ancient heart" repeats the same image without added pressure (−0.3). Artifacts touch multiple beats but not the closure image itself, so cumulative penalty remains within Q7. Clarity is maintained, but momentum is diluted by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with good information density and varied syntax. The opening paragraph builds atmosphere efficiently. However, several lines loop or over-explain: "His motivation wasn't treasure or power; it was something far more personal" restates what the next clause will specify. "The method was brilliant" tells rather than trusting the description. "Now empty of secrets but full of promise" is abstract label-speak that deflates the moment. Template opening in final paragraph: "In this world of ruin, where..." reads scaffolded.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear: "His fingers traced… cool against his skin" / "his charcoal sure and steady… a prayer… anchor himself" and the repeated "He [verb]" stems in the middle section ("He lifted his gaze… He focused… He reached out… He realized"). The figurative load is heavy ("taffy," "black velvet," "dying embers," "smoke," "physical blow," "alchemizing," "fulcrum") without always advancing pressure. Clarity remains intact and the closure image is clean, so artifacts do not obscure causality, but the density triggers −0.6 in Q7 per the patterned-artifact pack, preventing 9+ eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and opening/closing images anchor the arc. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The game was over, but the playing had just begun" immediately after "Kaelen smiled, the sky above him a canvas of possibility, and he painted his first stroke" restates closure without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through the descent sequence with repeated "Kaelen [verb]" stems. Figurative density in the chess exchange ("secrets like sunlight," "laughter like bells") blurs specificity during the pivotal beat. Information density is high overall, but scaffold sentences in the final third dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: the final paragraph restates the preceding material ("small gestures—the luminous absences that revealed more than presence ever could"), and multiple sentences across beats recycle the same content (e.g., lines about her dual identity as actor/survivor). Template cadence in the third paragraph ("the way a hand trembled…the slight hesitation…the tiny gestures") and the penultimate paragraph ("the way a lover's thumb…the slight smile…the deep breath") imposes mechanical rhythm. Stock metaphors ("dandelion seeds on wind," "toppled kings") and elevated diction ("benevolently ruthless," "luminous void") cluster without fresh specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("had once pretended," "had been paid," "had finally learned") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch multiple beats including the closure section, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.9)
    Syntax varies and figurative language is controlled, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: "remembering became too painful to bear" / "memories had become too sharp to endure" / "remembering became painful"; "substitute reality" / "alternate realities" / "seeded reality"; "hidden thunder within her" recurs three times without reweighting. Template cadence runs through the discovery sequence ("She had found… She had sensed… she finally… she now realized"). Information density is low—many sentences restate the same conceptual ground (talent awakening, power growing) without advancing situation or choice. The final paragraph stacks summary assertions rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well between contemplative pacing and labyrinth tension. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, "fidgets productively" appears twice identically, and "woven hush" recurs four times with minimal variation—a minor loop issue. The phrase "fierce repose" operates effectively as a motif but edges toward over-reliance. Figurative language (dewdrops, phantom pieces, chaff in storm) is vivid but occasionally ornamental in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but momentum is undercut by repeated scaffold phrases and paraphrase loops. "Innocently mischievous" appears three times; "defiant artist" recurs without variation. Several beats restate content: "the canyon finally answered him. A voice emerged…" then immediately glosses the same event. Template cadence is visible in the middle third ("Each day…his sessions grew…"; "By candlelight…Elaran would examine…"). Figurative language ("mist clung…like a shroud," "fingers piercing") is vivid early but the density does not escalate under pressure. The spire "crumbling" is asserted without sensory grounding or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings show variety, but several passages loop conceptually: "quilting memories," "weaving separate moments," and "threads of golden repair" all restate the same restoration metaphor without advancing pressure. The phrase "between breaths held underwater" appears twice as a structural marker but doesn't gain new meaning on the second pass. Stock metaphors cluster in key beats: "golden lines flowing like mercury," "dance of broken things made whole," "edge of oblivion" (used twice). Template cadence in paragraph four: "Each pockmark...Each matched pockmark...The dire enchantment..." The final paragraph stacks summary-mode abstractions ("not about saving...but about showing," "found his truth") that tell rather than show the resolution. Mixed metaphor: memories "floating in his mind" then "quilting" them together conflates liquid and textile vehicles. Information density is moderate; several beats could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear in adjacent lines: "intimately aloof, even to himself, keeping his thoughts and dreams locked away like treasures in a vault" restates the same idea; "fleeting and eternal all at once" echoes "temporary eternity" without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third ("He'd always been…," "He'd painted…," "He'd spent his life…"). Stock metaphors ("spiderweb of fractures," "ink into parchment") cluster without fresh transformation. The closing beat is burdened by these artifacts, applying the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Clarity and momentum are otherwise serviceable, with vivid images (phosphorescent moss, tide pools as "scattered jewels"), but the prose does not achieve high information density or propulsion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings diversify, yet several beats rely on template stems: "He did not speak… he closed his eyes… He did not think… It was a whisper… He did not drop it… He did not throw it… He did not cast it out." This anaphoric pattern is purposeful but verges on scaffold when sustained across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative density is high throughout—"sky bruised," "fragile egg," "needle of intent," "silent highway"—without muddled metaphors, though the cumulative weight slows momentum in the middle third. No paraphrase loops or clarity breaks; information density is strong, keeping the score in the upper-6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns drag momentum: paraphrase loops ("The station's silence wasn't empty anymore; it was filled with the quiet promise of return" echoes prior silence descriptions), stock metaphors ("stars whispered back," "moon hung like a silver coin"), and synonym churn around "loss," "grief," "solace," and "silence." Template cadence appears in the final third: "The navigation was the solace, and the solace was enough. The journey had no end, but that didn't matter." These artifacts cluster near closure, triggering a −1.2 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong; sentences advance story and atmosphere. However, multiple prose artifacts lower the score: "fractured grace" appears twice as a thematic placeholder; "psychological safety" and "empathy virus" recur as label-speak; "storm-battered" is used three times in variations without fresh information; and several sentences loop conceptually (e.g., "involuntarily truthful" restated across paragraphs, "antique glass eye" + "smuggled relic" cycling). Template cadence in exposition: "After the pandemic... such isolated communities had become necessary enclaves" reads as summary scaffold. The final paragraph's "smuggled relic that might offer others what it had just given her" paraphrases the prior beat. Figurative language is controlled but the abstract vocabulary ("occlusion," "psychological exposure") occasionally pulls the prose toward essay register. No major grammar or tense errors; spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure supports the meditative pace. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty. However, paraphrase loops appear: "borrowed memories" and variants recur across adjacent paragraphs without escalation. Template cadence is visible in the penultimate paragraph ("The softly persistent pull," "their solitude now witnessed, their gestures now understood"). Stock metaphors ("mist becoming sea," "ocean breezes that understood") appear in the closure beat, dulling specificity. Figurative density in the final third reads as overwriting without clear payoff. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, plus −0.4 for metaphor muddle in the closure beat, totaling −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "it was a key. But to what?" immediately followed by "The question gnawed at him" restates the same content. Template cadence is visible in the cavern sequence: "The ants led… the ants continued… the ants scattered." Stock metaphors populate peak beats ("the weight of their silence," "time, like water, carved its own course"). The final third contains figurative density without payoff: "night bloomed outside," "edges softening under the weight of possibility," "a rare and fragile thing." Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("infinite possibilities," "acknowledgment that even the most solitary journeys") that clashes with the concrete dealer's POV. Information density is high in the shop and creek beats but thins in the cavern and map-room summary. Combined, these artifacts touch the closure and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("starlight bled down stone walls in silver rivulets that dried to rust," "seasons merged like watercolors"), creating coherent atmosphere but also slowing momentum during peak beats. Template cadence appears in the opening: "For three months, recurring dreams… / Tonight, with lightning… / Dawn broke gray…" using time-marker stems without variance. Paraphrase loop in paragraph four: "She approached cautiously, watching as the embers flared… / she was not dreaming of this place but remembering it" restates recognition across adjacent sentences. Filter-verb reliance ("watching as," "confirming he had known") dulls immediacy. The final paragraph stacks exposition ("the kingdom below seemed fragile," "promised by the cobalt grotto," "the price of her awakening would be paid") where scene pressure would serve better. Cumulative line-level debt: −0.8 in Q7 for template stems, paraphrase loop, and filter stacks in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose carries significant overwriting: nearly every sentence in the central beat stacks metaphor ("threads of memory, a whisper of laughter, a flicker of devotion") without concrete action anchors. Paraphrase loops appear ("not just observation, but transformation" / "she couldn't simply record it; she had to return differently"). Filter verbs and abstract nominalization ("the sheer, unrepeatable weight," "the essence of their shared history") dull immediacy. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]," and synonym churn recycles "resolve," "essence," "density" without added pressure. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and warranting deduction beyond baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is selective. However, multiple instances of paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "temporal confusion" / "chronologically confused" / "scrambled existence" cycle across paragraphs; "distill chaos into narrative" / "make sense of the disjointed visions" restate without added pressure. The phrase "birch bark scroll" recurs six times in 800 words with minimal variation. Template cadence in the opening ("Time had grown slippery...or was it last decade? / dates already chiseled...though the end date remained distressingly near") creates artificial parallel structures. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.4), and synonym churn (−0.3) penalties totaling −0.9, plus minor density loss, lands the score here.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops appear: "ordinary miracles" recurs three times in the final third without evolving meaning, and the "trembling calm" phrase bookends without transformation. The closing paragraph stacks summary constructions ("she had come here to fix clocks, but instead, she had fixed herself") that restate rather than advance. Figurative density is high throughout without consistent pattern-teaching—"water drops," "soft footfalls on sand," "foreign landscape," "compass"—blurring the closure image. Template stems ("The water clock dripped") recur mechanically. Total artifacts across the final third trigger Q7 penalty and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively (short declarations during crystallization, longer cadences for the storm's approach) and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, action, and interiority simultaneously. Some metaphoric density in the opening third ("island of warmth," "saturated hush," "crystal-edge of stress") borders on overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor scaffold: "a process of shedding his analogue self for something mineral and structured" tells what has been shown; the final paragraph's "quiet clarity of a transformation complete" edges toward summary. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; the prose propels cleanly through the ritual sequence with strong verbs and specific nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.0)
    Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively. However, scaffolding and paraphrase loops appear: "gossip-column exorcist" is explained twice in the opening paragraph; "time to try something new" and the oscillator description overlap functionally. The phrase "gravel and starlight" is metaphorical muddle—voice texture cannot be both simultaneously. Minor template cadence in the climax ("The blue light brightened, and the voice grew stronger") without rhythm variation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "ancient temple library lost in time" / "sanctuary that existed simultaneously at the beginning and end of all things"; "unravel cosmic illusions" / "distinguish between the false and the merely misunderstood." Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" constructions. Figurative language stacks without coherence: "universe's hiccup," "shattered mirror with no reflection," "spiral," "resounding hush"—all invoked but not integrated. Information density is low; many lines restate the philosophical premise without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clarity and concision are generally strong, with sentences advancing character and atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The hydraulic clocks didn't just measure time; they defined it. They carved flowing moments…" restates the same idea across two sentences. Template cadence surfaces in the reflection-heavy middle: "His colleagues had often questioned… But as he flipped through the pages… Elias understood…" The final paragraph stacks explanatory clauses that border on exposition. "Eminently peculiar" recurs three times as a label without fresh texture. Information density is solid in the observational beats but thins during the logbook and sunset passages.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice ("rainwashed library at midsummer smelled of damp paper and ozone"), but paraphrase loops recur: "She was collecting fragments of chaos, a mosaic to counter his ordered world" restates the premise already shown in the scrawl-gathering beats. Template stems appear ("She smiled; a gambler's maxim," "She felt a pang of guilt," "She knew his answer") and figurative language stacks in mid-passage ("clover melancholy," "mica pane," "mosaic," "lucid contradiction") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Filter verbs ("she thought," "she felt," "she knew") cluster in reflective beats, dulling immediacy. No single artifact obscures causality, but the cumulative drag prevents higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    Information density is high, but the piece loops conceptually: multiple lines restate the loop structure, the disc's haunting quality, and Archie's realization without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in several passages (e.g., "The loop always began the same way: the glass harmonica disc would awaken... then the telephone would demand..."). Register remains consistent, but several phrases veer into abstract diction ("harmonic support to his carefully chosen words," "the disc's evolving composition") that distances the reader from sensory immediacy. The paraphrase loop around "wrong number friendships" and "teach endings how to begin" recurs across paragraphs without new detail, triggering the baseline loop penalty. No figurative muddle, but propulsion stalls in the reflective middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear frequently: "haunted euphoria" recurs four times without reweighting; "regenerated covenant" and "blooming jetty" are restated across adjacent paragraphs; "proximate causes" and "gently thorough" function as labels rather than dramatized methods. Template cadence is visible in stacked "Elias [verb]" constructions and parallel reflective clauses. Several sentences restate content without added pressure (e.g., the locket is described as memento, then proof of connection, then manifestation of love within two paragraphs). Information density is moderate—many lines do descriptive work but few advance multiple story jobs simultaneously. Figurative language ("like a gentle fist") is sparse and functional where present.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully ("The air smelled of damp earth and rust, a place time had forgotten" → short internal beat → longer reflective close). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Two minor loops: "loneliness" appears with near-synonym phrasing ("vacuum in his chest," "loneliness so profound," "loneliness hadn't vanished") across three paragraphs without escalating pressure between mentions, triggering a −0.2 paraphrase check. "Jocular" and its synonyms recur slightly mechanically. No figurative muddle; "moon rock, smooth and dark, a sample from a past life in geology" is clean. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Clarity and concision are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and sensory lines often do double duty (ring warmth, tremor-speech). However, patterned artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("not as a destination but as a presence," "not as a place but as a state of being," "not of the world outside but of the world within"), template "the X came as Y" cadence for all three notes, and filter-verb reliance ("could feel," "realized"). The closure paragraph stacks summary ("he had reached," "he realized," "he finally saw") rather than propelling through image. Synonym churn ("chaos of sounds," "ultrasonic song," "symphony") recurs without added pressure. Apply −0.8 for multiple artifacts; −1.0 total for touching closure with summary stack.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity is mostly intact; grammar and punctuation are clean. Rhythm varies somewhat but repetitive sentence openings accumulate: "The interpreter [verb]" appears nine times, "The anomaly [verb]" five times, creating template cadence that flattens momentum. Paraphrase loops are pervasive: the final six paragraphs restate the earned stance ("confidently uncertain," "editing history," "thresh meaning," "strange comfort," "garden of doubt") without adding pressure. Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries metaphor (pen as tool/companion, anomaly as language/heartbeat, seeds/garden/weeds as doubt/imperfection)—but the vehicles remain consistent and legible. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (pen action + thematic echo) but the ending third rehashes rather than advances. The opening and closing images (pen on desk, anomaly pulsing) frame purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence carries figurative layering ("talisman," "cage of glass and metal," "thread of silk," "beacon in the dark," "wings"). Paraphrase loops appear: "capture nothing but light" / "aperture open to the void" / "trap its light"; "sorrow entwined with hope" / "melancholy and wonder" / "joy and grief." Template cadence: "Lyra's hands moved," "Lyra smiled," "Lyra's gestures grew bolder." Density penalty (−0.5), coherence slip in mixed metaphors (−0.3), and loop penalty (−0.4) compound. Stock metaphors ("heart swelled," "eyes alight with fire") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is low; many lines restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is clean at the sentence level but suffers from paraphrase loops ("She had to portray her" / "she painted a mural" / "Again, she painted it") and template cadence in the fragment-discovery sequence. Stock metaphors ("volcanic tenderness," "eyes like storm clouds") recur without fresh vehicle logic. Information density is modest—many lines restate Elara's process rather than advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks summary ("turned restorer," "found peace," "led her home") where a charged image would serve closure better.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "entangled memories" appears six times with minimal reweighting; "auric lagoon under starlight" recurs as a stock phrase in eleven lines without functional variation. Template cadence dominates the final third—"The garden's waves… the lagoon's starlight… the universe's breath"—flattening momentum. Mixed metaphors ("sound waves bending light," "waves lapping at shores") blur rather than clarify. Sentence stems repeat ("Kael's drumming," "The garden hummed," "The entangled memories") without advancing pressure. Scaffold phrasing ("a moment suspended," "a promise kept") pads closure beats where concrete action is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity holds and information advances per sentence, but template cadence dominates: "He unfolded... Pulling out... holding it up" chains identical participial openers across high-pressure beats. Stock metaphors appear without fresh angle: "shadows stretching and recoiling like living things," "mask of irritation," "city of steel giants." Paraphrase loop near the end: "the labyrinth was alive" stated twice in close succession without added pressure. The whisper-test beat delivers propulsion, but overwriting at closure ("where whispers became legends") and redundant storm descriptions dull the final image. No severe artifacts touch causality, keeping this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "silent empathy" appears three times, "teach darkness the value of stars" four times verbatim, "spiralingly calm" twice without variation. Template cadence runs: "His [noun] [verb]" opens multiple consecutive sentences. The phrase "within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is poetic but unclear—what secret, whose, and how does it reverberate? Stock metaphors stack without coherence: "puddles held the sky like scattered memories," "tears tracing paths... like miniature tributaries." Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("seemed to hover," "appeared to," "felt different"). Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.0 cumulative in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.9)
    Repeated metaphors and near-synonyms create paraphrase loops: "hush where past meets prophecy" appears three times with identical phrasing; "unspoken words" and "quiet rebellion/revolution" recur without evolving. Template cadence is evident in stacked participial openers: "adjusting," "cradling," "organizing," "arranging." The bakery-window beat tells Arthur's thought ("Understanding isn't the goal... The goal is the wondering") aloud "though only to himself," a contradiction that reads as scaffolding. Figurative density is high—mist as "hesitant fingers," truth as "tuning fork," consciousness as "dominoes in expanding circles"—but several images are generic rather than specific to this voice or world. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −0.8 for loops and template stems across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "freedom wasn't a place but a choice" / "she'd found it...in the whale's call to embrace herself"; "the scrimshaw seemed to hum" / "the scrimshaw began to glow" / "the scrimshaw glowed once, then dimmed." Template cadence: "She [verb], the [noun]" pattern repeats across eight sentences in the final third. Figurative language is frequent but often mixed: "Violence she'd never known gave way to tender ferocity"—violence as container, tenderness as destination—strains coherence. Stock phrases: "unapologetically," "true nature," "finally home in her own skin." Line-level clarity is adequate but density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing knowledge or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose carries distinct rhythmic choices (short declaratives, theatrical fragments, extended metaphor in "birch" line) but several patterns repeat across beats: "The [noun] [verbs]" openers appear in at least four self-narrations without variation or payoff. "Beside Elara lay" / "beneath the floorboards lay" / "among the dried stems" constructions create a template cadence. The phrase "dried flower bouquet" recurs seven times with minimal synonym variation, functioning as anchor but also loop. Information density is adequate—most sentences advance ritual, setting, or internal state—but the theatrical-narration device becomes scaffold rather than pressure, especially when it persists identically during the inspector scene where urgency should compress syntax. Minor filter-verb reliance ("remained hidden," "continued their endless rotation") dulls immediacy in a few beats but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is often vivid and rhythmically controlled: "its cold surface vibrating against his skin like the strings of a cosmic cello." However, the piece suffers from template-cadence runs in the final third ("This was his new purpose," "This was the moment," "The atrium was not a place but a state of being") and paraphrase loops (the ending revisits "boundary," "hum," "colonnade," "atrium" in near-identical phrasing across six sentences without added pressure). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure, triggering overwriting penalties. Information density is moderate; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high across most beats (the plant lexicon, the barter choreography, the reed's hum). The opening paragraph, however, stacks exposition and summary ("or so he called himself," "This was the timeframe of his life") with mild redundancy and scaffolding that slows entry. The phrase "a bartered awakening, a trade he believed only Lyra could facilitate" paraphrases across adjacent clauses, and the template opener "He was…" recurs three times in close proximity. The closure beat—amber, sienna, cobalt, peach, rose—sharpens specificity and propels cleanly, lifting the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching: "memories caught in amber," "dissonant chord," "symphony yet to come." Multiple paraphrase loops appear—"The bell ringer smiled," then "The bell ringer smiled again"; "artificial pilgrimage" is restated across three adjacent lines near the end without new pressure. Template cadence runs: "The bell ringer [verb]" opens numerous sentences. Stock metaphors ("miniature sun," "halo of warmth") and therapy-speak ("emotional aftereffect," "creation") dull immediacy. Cumulative artifact penalty (loops, template stems, stock metaphor strings) totals approximately −1.2, and the presence of artifacts in the closure paragraph triggers the additional penalty, pushing total deduction to −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense and sometimes mixed: "curtains of intention" as "fabric between what is and what might be" stacks metaphors without clarifying mechanics. Template cadence appears in the final third: "His mourning jewelry business had transformed... They learned to create... Elian's mourning jewelry business had transformed" loops the same conceptual ground. Stock phrases accumulate: "storm clouds," "deepest valleys," "quiet flame against the darkness." Paraphrase loops: the final two paragraphs restate legacy and transformation without advancing pressure. Line-level clarity suffers under the density of abstract concepts and metaphysical framing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies, and opening/closing images anchor the piece with rain-beaded skylight framing. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance description or mood without layering multiple jobs. Several paraphrase loops appear: "cryptocurrency crashes" is mentioned six times across the story, and "measuring tape" recurs in similar phrasing ("ran her thumb along," "picked up the measuring tape," "extended the measuring tape"). Stock metaphor in "the Tower moment is necessary before the Star can emerge" feels thesis-like rather than organic. Clarity remains high with no major grammar or continuity breaks, and no template-cadence runs or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence pervades: "She had [verb]" and "The [noun]" open consecutive sentences throughout, creating drumbeat monotony. Paraphrase loops cluster around key terms: multiple sentences restate "forbidden knowledge," "steadily unpredictable," and "purification" without adding pressure. Figurative language defaults to stock metaphors ("whispers across continents," "essence of what had been"). Prompt-label recycling ("atoms of nostalgia," "end of innocence") appears in nearly every paragraph without transformation, flattening momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening and middle: "shadows were unbound" / "shadows becoming unbound" / "shadows were becoming unbound" across multiple paragraphs; "by comparing silent video footage from decades apart" appears verbatim twice without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the fourth and fifth paragraphs ("Her metamorphosis had begun… By comparing… Elara understood…"). Stock metaphors ("shadows stretched like fingers," "bleeding from human hearts") and abstraction ("luminous regret," "methodical resolve") blur specificity. These artifacts span multiple beats, triggering cumulative −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is largely clean with purposeful sensory detail and clear syntax. Information density is adequate; most sentences advance atmosphere or characterization. However, several scaffold patterns appear: synonym loops ("misty...mist," "shimmering stillness...shimmering...shimmer"), paraphrase across adjacent beats (the "shedding layers" concept restated three times without added pressure), and stock metaphor strings ("the shifting landscape of her fragile convictions"). The chameleon's color changes feel mechanically cycled (emerald-gold-dusk-black-silver) without dramatized causality. Template cadence in the final exchange ("Not just that...I'm reconstructing...") flattens propulsion. These artifacts do not obscure closure entirely but dull line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (concentric coffee rings, silver sand, meteor hush) charges key images, but several beats loop: "The frosted hourglass…never quite shifting" reappears three times with minimal progression, and "closure" is both Maya's trait and the thematic keyword, creating synonym churn. Template cadence: "She had developed…she understood…she had been displacing…she realized" stacks similar stems. The penultimate paragraph summarizes the resolution ("Tomorrow, she would begin teaching…") rather than dramatizing a first teaching beat. No fatal opacity, but density dips in the final third as telling replaces showing.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and sentences generally advance. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He had his answer" is immediately restated as "its profound simplicity was staggering." The phrase "hushed thunder" recurs three times without reweighting. The non-English character "贡献" (contribution) in the final paragraph is a clear artifact. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "coiled like a silver serpent" then "edges cool and smooth" (serpents are not metallic). Apply −0.6 for loops and artifact presence in closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.9)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language ("aurora-lit," "moonstruck," "shadowed rapture," "golden tear") without pattern-teaching or payoff, producing density that obscures rather than propels. Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening and middle ("trapped creativity," "stifled creativity," "creativity begin to lift," "creativity she had freed"). Template cadence dominates: "She adjusted… She gasped… She laughed… She had not yet written… She stood…" Syndrome loops: "The archway pulsed… The archway intensified… The archway flared… The aurora dimmed…" Stock metaphors (frozen dawn, golden tear, threads of memory) accumulate without earned charge. These artifacts dull the closure beat and spread across the text, triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("ghost flowers," "whisper to the uncertainty") is generally fresh. Information density is high and the prose advances atmosphere and concept efficiently. However, several lines loop conceptually: "occasionally everywhere" appears three times with near-identical framing; "dreamless" and "emptiness" recur without added nuance; "branching" appears in archive, paths, futures, and final image without functional variation. The phrase "through wave functions" (paragraph 3 and 7) reads as scaffold repetition. Paragraph structure is purposeful but one paraphrase loop: "his mind remained stubbornly blank when night fell" (para 1) and "his mind remained empty of dreams when he slept" (final para) restate without adding pressure. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems across peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and vivid noun phrases (brass vines, oak-wrought iron). However, pervasive scaffold and paraphrase loops dull momentum: "translocate during sleep, awakening in different groves" is repeated conceptually three times; "hum of insight" is restated in multiple forms across paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the opening ("Since the sixth sense had awakened… After the sixth sense awakened…"). Figurative language occasionally muddles ("insight vibrated through Elian's bones," "consciousness expanding through the mechanical forest itself"). The final paragraph stacks abstractions without propulsion. No catastrophic breaks, but density and line-level propulsion sag under repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops: "after the leash breaks" appears three times, "gently persistent" twice, "indirect routes" three times, "unused courage" four times, "shoreline lullaby" three times—synonym churn without added pressure. Template cadence: "The guides [verb]...the traveler [verb]...the [noun] [verb]" across most paragraphs. Mixed metaphors: "fibers of rope that no longer bound but now supported" contradicts the leash-breaking premise. Register drifts into therapy-speak ("identity becomes choice rather than circumstance") and motivational abstraction ("limitless horizons," "true potential unfurls"). High-density figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff: "twilight hours when day and night held their breath," "shorelines of past and present lapped at the edges," "understanding beginning to crystallize like foam on waves."

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs harm momentum: "The bellhop's motivation was simple: to understand…" / "The bellhop's hands trembled as he realized…" / "The bellhop descended, his steps measured, his resolve hardened." Figurative density in the final third ("shroud," "cold, quiet fire," "frostbitten hope," "dawn he couldn't yet see") obscures rather than sharpens the closure image. Stock metaphors ("heart raced," "mind racing") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the fortress's frostbitten hope settle," "seemed lighter now") dull immediacy at peak beats, triggering baseline artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("like a miniature nebula," "silk tearing"). However, several lines loop or restate: "graceful collapse" appears three times; "drift" recurs across eleven instances without pattern-taught payoff beyond thematic echo. The phrase "regally unpretentious" is repeated verbatim in opening and closing. "Seeding history's currents with truths that would drift downstream" and the prior sentence about "rune of drift" paraphrase the same idea. Template cadence in the middle section: "A scholar... found... A guard captain... read..." Information density is high in the closure beat, but scaffolding in the setup ("his self-imposed prison and his only weapon") slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and middle beats. Clarity is maintained through most moves, and the atlas page's tactile presence (edges curled, folded, slipped into pocket) grounds abstraction. However, paraphrase loops appear: "paths disappeared because they were never meant to last" and "paths hadn't disappeared; they had only changed" restate the same insight across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in the final third: "The station creaked again... Elias knew then... Elias stepped outside... The station faded..." creates a mechanical rhythm. The closure beat is diluted by summary ("he was finally ready to walk them again") rather than a single charged image. Stock metaphor: "like ghosts," "like dawn on a fogged horizon." Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence touching the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and most lines advance setting or character state, but figurative density clusters heavily in high-pressure beats: "dust motes that drifted like distant galaxies," "a ship whose engine had died mid-voyage," "in the hollows of her chest," "the fire of rediscovery." Multiple adjacent lines employ metaphor without tight causal work, creating textural drag (−0.5). Template cadence appears in the third paragraph: "The stones were a mystery... who had believed..." and "she closed her eyes, letting the hum... a thunderous serenity that drowned out..." (−0.3). One paraphrase loop: "The lull wasn't an end—it was a pause, a breath before the next surge" restates the same content without new pressure (−0.2). No major clarity breaks, but cumulative artifacts prevent higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately, but several beats rely on scaffold phrasing: "What the New Regime couldn't understand" and "That was when she realized" are template openers. Paraphrase loops appear ("traditions meant to protect it" / "traditions beginning to evolve"). Figurative language in the opening ("insurgent spirit burned brighter than the steam") and closing ("living wisdom") is serviceable but leans generic. The cryptic-script beat is summarized ("Each evening... she would study") rather than shown, flattening momentum. Information density is moderate; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines advance character or image. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Root systems became metaphors for how trauma takes hold beneath the surface. The seasonal cycles offered perspective on healing after catastrophe" restates the same content across adjacent sentences without added pressure (−0.2). The phrase "quietly talented hands" recurs three times in near-identical constructions, edging toward template cadence but not egregious (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "pearl of stillness" recurs purposefully. Minor scaffold and synonym churn prevent entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "luminescent ache," "tapestry of what-ifs," "fractured reality," "necessary darkness" cluster without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear throughout—"The artist was no longer crestfallen; he was something new, something remade" and "The forgotten library had not failed him; it had taught him to redesign his world, one thread at a time" restate rather than advance. Template cadence runs dominate: "The library was… The lighthouse stood… The artist began… The artist smiled… The tarot box hummed…" across consecutive sentences. Mixed metaphors ("walls close in" then "walls receded" then "walls no longer closed in—they opened") and stock phrasing ("where the light gets in") reduce clarity. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective. However, multiple paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences appear: "not the calm before a storm, but the pause after a fall" / "not hot or loud, but serene"; "disappeared into the shadows, not as an act of hiding, but as one of belonging"; "not because of physics, but because the mind fought." The final third repeats "Kael's [noun]" and "The [noun]" sentence stems across seven lines, creating template cadence. Stock metaphors ("the calm eye of a storm," "time's fractured heart") accumulate without fresh vehicle. Information density is moderate; several beats describe Kael's state without advancing action. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template runs touching the closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe template-cadence debt: runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "She [verb]" structures span the entire piece without variation, triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops abound—"contraband truths" is restated four times in slightly different phrasing; "bravely conflicted" appears twice as a label without added meaning. Mixed metaphors clutter peak beats: "the weight of it felt like wings" contradicts itself; "fires burned" under snow lacks physical logic. Stock phrases ("the taste of freedom," "a ghost in the snow," "the world waking up") replace concrete images. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same idea (e.g., the letter's impact, the council's collapse) without advancing pressure. Cumulative artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "sandbag scrap" is described three times with nearly identical phrasing, "tranquil blaze" recurs as a stock phrase, and several sentences restate her pacifism without added information. Template cadence runs through the middle section (repeated "Her X had…" and "Elara would…" stems). Information density is low; most paragraphs elaborate a single idea rather than advancing pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") stack without voice motivation in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout (humming buds, weeping stars, symphony of absence, feral lullaby) without clear pattern-teaching or payoff anchored in closure mechanics; nearly every sentence carries metaphor, risking overwriting. Paraphrase loops appear: "the garden's hum" recurs three times across adjacent beats without added pressure; "cool-headed" appears twice in the opening third with scaffold-like insistence. Sentence openings vary and syntax supports the ritual's rhythm, but the cumulative metaphorical load and minor loops prevent entry to high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "orbits of regret" recurs three times without reweighting, and "contradiction" is restated across adjacent lines ("The contradiction began to bloom," "The contradiction was screaming now"). The opening's rhetorical question and the closing's thematic summary ("built not on ink and paper, but on contradiction") edge toward overwriting. Figurative language is dense but sometimes contradictory: "orbits of regret" mixes celestial motion with emotional state without a clear vehicle. Minor scaffold phrases ("With solemn playfulness," "The only thing left") slow momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high (amber, firmware, constellations interwoven), but several scaffold phrases dull momentum: "His life's work was to release them, if only for a while" and "some sounds require decades to find their form" read as thematic summary rather than scene propulsion. The final paragraph overexplains the resonance effect rather than trusting the image. No major loops or template cadence, and the opening anchors voice effectively. The slight overwriting in peak beats (explaining rather than showing the firmware's resolution) and the expository close keep the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs degrade momentum: "Her fingers…danced" / "Her fingers…began to work"; "The emergent hush…" repeated across adjacent paragraphs; "Her socially perceptive nature/mind" functions as synonym churn. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity ("like ghosts," "like a living thing," "struck with the suddenness of lightning"). Some lines serve scaffold rather than advance pressure: "It wasn't magic, not exactly—it was something more fundamental" recaps without adding detail. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to breathe," "seemed to vibrate," "seemed muted") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("glowed with the light of reconnection and rebirth"), triggering the elevated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively ("ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" / "The world listened"). Minor paraphrase loop detected: "retrocognitively trapped" is introduced, then immediately restated as "looping back to the fire"; "aberrant mercy" appears twice in adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.3). Some phrases lean toward stock lyricism ("fire of her own making, one that did not destroy but restored") and elevated diction occasionally stalls momentum. Information density is moderate; several sentences do double duty (setting + interiority), but the middle section recycles renaming gestures without advancing causality. Clarity and propulsion are steady overall.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and vivid sensory detail (dust motes, silver bark, blue leaves). Information density is solid; most sentences advance story or character. Two paraphrase loops appear: "synesthetically blessed nature" is restated as "synesthetic ability" and "Synesthesia" across adjacent beats, and "encore-seeking nature" recurs three times without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the penultimate paragraph: "The rising nostalgia…" / "The orchard garden would wait…" / "The theater would live on…"—three consecutive declarative future statements that dull momentum. No filter-verb stacks or figurative muddle in peak beats. Artifact deduction: −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; not touching closure directly but present in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the story exhibits paraphrase loops: "The pill had promised unity but delivered a discordant chorus" is restated as "telepathy pill had been a catastrophe, a corporate nightmare" without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear in the opening ("It had been three weeks… It was fractally precise… She was, by nature") and the closure sequence ("She had devised… She had forged…"). Stock metaphor appears ("storm of empathy," "pocket of stillness") and "fractally precise" is repeated three times across the text without evolving meaning. These artifacts dull momentum in the final third, triggering a −0.8 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the read-aloud test passes cleanly, with no glaring loops or template cadence. Minor scaffold appears: "She knelt by a tidal pool" followed by "She pulled out the fossil" and "She reached out" repeats the "She [verb]" stem without added pressure. The phrase "factually mystical" is a mixed metaphor—fact and mysticism contradict—and "shimmering, opalescent glow" stacks modifiers in a high-pressure moment, slightly blurring clarity. No artifact touches the closure beat directly, limiting the penalty under the Non-closure Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.6)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing anchor the arc, but paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "The prophecy unraveled… not a fixed path but a tapestry" is restated as "fate was not a chain but a lattice" three paragraphs later (−0.2). Template cadence runs appear ("She found… Another…" and "The hourglass… The canyon echo… The prophecy…"), dulling momentum in the cataloging sequence (−0.4). Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching ("amber warehouse," "canyon echo," "unearthed silence," "tapestry," "lattice") but remains mostly coherent; however, "spin a prophecy into raw possibility" mixes metaphor vehicles (textile + energy state) without clear logic (−0.3). Aggregate artifacts reduce propulsion but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is controlled and atmospheric with strong imagery ("mist swirled around his ankles like cold, ectoplasmic water," "unfurling it felt like cracking a bone"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "fixing what's broken" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "silver hush" recurs decoratively. Template cadence in reflective passages: "He had always been prudently daring... He had not seen it in ten years... He knew then what must be done." Filter-verb reliance ("He understood," "He felt," "He knew") stacks in the final third, dulling immediacy. Some elevated diction ("vouchsafe") reads as imposed rather than voice-organic. Information density is moderate; several lines restate emotional state without advancing plot.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The promise was simple and yet not" echoes "some truths could only be spoken aloud once…"; "The fog thickened, softening the edges…" restates atmosphere already established. Template stems recur: "He had understood then…" "He rose…" "He mounted…" Filter-verb reliance ("saw his brother's eyes," "felt the weight") dulls immediacy in key beats. Figurative density ("percolated," "spindrift," "palimpsest") clusters without clear causal linkage, and mixed metaphors ("secrets bubbling up like whispers") muddle sense. Closure beat summarizes emotional shift rather than landing on concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid ("crystallized, ageless honey," "sliver of fractured light," "grey river against the sky"). However, several prose artifacts drag momentum: paraphrase loops ("The air here did not just resist change; it vibrated with it" followed by "thrum resonated"), template cadence in the investigation sequence ("He discovered... He found... He needed... He lit... He waited"), and elevated diction that occasionally clashes with concrete action ("phototropic nature flared" at the climax reads abstract). The final third carries figurative density (sunbeam metaphor, truth settling) without pattern-teaching, which slightly obscures the mechanics of resolution. Information density is high, but scaffold phrases like "His method was not to force a path but to observe" tell rather than show through action.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and varied, but several loops and near-paraphrases appear: "after the final petal drops" is used three times, "wistfully pragmatic" twice, "protected vulnerability" twice. The phrase "rhythm of oars in water" appears twice in identical form without reweighting. Template cadence in the middle section ("Each reflective surface… the bitting gauge tooth served…") slightly dulls momentum. No figurative muddle or major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping deductions modest.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "brittle awakenings," "crystalline shell," "atomically reflective," "tidal library," "cosmic cycles" stack without causal work, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.6). Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "isolation…wrapped around her like a shroud" / "profound loneliness of being the last of her kind" and "brittle awakening" recurs five times without reweighting. Template cadence is visible in parallel "The [noun]'s [quality]" constructions across adjacent sentences. Clarity suffers under the metaphor load, and momentum stalls as reflection loops without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid ("each drop a tiny, shattered jewel"). Information density is high in the opening and sculpture paragraphs. However, the climax paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops: "They were not separate; they were colors... They were not his burdens; they were his tesserae"—synonym churn that restates the same revelation. The phrase "no bigger than his palm" and "miniature galaxy of organic purpose" add decorative layers without advancing pressure. Stock metaphor "thread" recurs without evolving specificity. These artifacts cluster near closure, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the Q7 rule.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is clean and grammatical but leans heavily on summary and abstraction. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "These patterns contained...formulas and musical sequences" is followed by three claims of what "various factions" saw, all in parallel structure. The climax is told in past-perfect summary ("had programmed," "began losing") rather than immediate scene. Template cadence runs through exposition blocks ("The power plays...intensified," "She had to interfere"). Line-level clarity is adequate, but information density is low—many sentences restate stakes without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops pervade the text: "spatial mutiny" appears eight times with minimal variation, "reverberation of a lonely church organ" is repeated verbatim across four paragraphs, and "shadowed nexus under starlight" recurs as a template anchor. Figurative language stacks without coherence—"hungry maws," "captured auroras," "prismatic shards," "gossamer"—in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats, creating density without propulsion. Runs of identical stems dominate: "She clutched...She needed...She worked...She examined..." and "The claustrophobic explorer adjusted...fought...allowed herself...found herself..." across separate paragraphs. The final third loops through thematic summary ("Her adventure had been prudent yet bold, calculated yet transformative") instead of landing a single image, and the closing line recycles "wistful rebellion" for the fourth time without reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is generally high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (establishing world, advancing ritual, layering motifs). However, several lines loop or restate: "He didn't need to see Lena's face to know her; he needed to feel her absence" echoes the earlier "not people...but cases," and "another piece of the world's forgotten sorrow given form" paraphrases the empathy motivation already established. Template cadence appears in repeated constructions: "He was not here to find... his motivation ran deeper" / "He didn't know if it mattered... but he knew it was necessary." Stock metaphors cluster without fresh turns: "shield against chaos," "sliver of defiance," "veil of forgotten tears." These patterns dull momentum in the final third, though they do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence patterns appear: "Elias felt the spongey dread" recurs with slight synonym variation, and several sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Elias [verb]" in rapid succession. Key beats—nail insertion, console response, containment field weakening—are summarized rather than shown with sensory or causal texture. Stock metaphors ("monument to a bravery") and abstract descriptors ("raw, chaotic energy") replace concrete imagery. The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("no longer just a trait but a choice," "symbol of both freedom and responsibility") that explain rather than dramatize the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "She returned to the pullout daily, playing her fiddle while scanning… On the third day…" and "She spent hours deciphering… eventually realizing…" echo stock progression markers. The phrase "pixelated amnesty" appears five times with synonym churn ("digitalized pardon," "a way to make sense of the impossible"). Filter-verb stacks ("She discovered," "She learned," "She began documenting") cluster in the middle third. Mixed metaphor: "sculpt possibility from the ashes" conflates tactile craft with combustion residue. Deductions total approximately −1.4 in Q7 for paraphrase loops (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), and filter-verb stacks near peaks (−0.5).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and momentum are generally sound, with strategic compression of the startup's rise and fall. Information density is high in the opening (trunk, currencies, circus train established within two paragraphs). However, several lines loop conceptually: "Jasper's polished calm" and "perceptively calm" appear multiple times with synonym variation rather than new pressure, and the phrase "some paths circle back" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence in paragraph five ("how certain marks could say...how territory was claimed") and paragraph seven ("not when...but when") creates minor rhythm drag. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative scaffold across the middle third lowers the score. The opening and closing lines are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean and readable. Paraphrase loops appear: "growing anxiety over the temple inscriptions" / "temple inscriptions...their meanings just beyond her grasp" and "shared burden" / "burden...carried alone" / "burden wasn't hers alone" recycle the same content across paragraphs (−0.4). Filter-verb reliance ("witnessed," "realized," "knew") flattens immediacy in key beats. Sentence rhythm varies adequately; no major clarity failures.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The druid had always been guarded" / "The druid had always found lost things" / "The druid had always believed"; "The vortex churned" / "The vortex spun faster" / "the vortex pulled him in" / "The orchard's vortex stilled." Template cadence with "The druid [verb]" stems appears in nine sentences, triggering a −0.6 deduction. The final third contains synonym churn ("frozen confession" repeated, "swirling" recurs) and scaffold phrasing ("The druid turned away," "The druid walked into"). Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 for loops and stems, escalated to −1.2 because artifacts touch the closure beat. Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("a river of memory flowing backward and forward"). Minor metaphor muddle: "anxious elation… buoyant dread that squeezed his lungs yet urged his feet forward" stacks contradictory vehicles without clarifying the paradox through action. Paraphrase loop present: "The future hadn't broken the covenant out of malice; it had broken it because it was lonely" immediately followed by "And the dream world had recoiled not out of weakness, but because it had been abandoned half-spoken"—template parallelism that restates the same thesis with synonym churn. Stock phrasing: "unadulterated awe," "profound sense of purpose." Information density is high overall; clarity holds except where abstraction ("intersection of dreams," "shifting logic") substitutes for concrete image. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled. However, paraphrase loops appear: "his resolve hardening" (opening) / "his resolve renewed" (closing); "the reckless idealist" appears twice as a label. Template stems recur: "He was a reckless idealist," "He was fiercely gentle," "He reached," "He pulled," "He plucked." The phrase "not his own, but close enough to understand" and "Elian gasped, feeling the other man's memories" tell rather than dramatize the memory transfer. Stock metaphor: "the sting of loss, the burn of betrayal, the quiet of surrender."

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive. Two issues: (1) Paraphrase loop in the opening—"rubble of his own life" and "assign value to things others had discarded, just as he had been" restate the same metaphor without added pressure (−0.2). (2) Stock metaphor "ghost of the noise he once loved" and "low, steady hum of an old tube amp warming up" are competent but border on generic (−0.3). The closure image "listen to the silence, and finally understand its song" is evocative but leans abstract. Information density is high; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "hovering over her shoulder... his form wavering" and "knowledge fruit seed" repeated across beats without variation. Template cadence in opening: multiple "her [noun]" constructions. The phrase "touching distance缩小" includes a stray Chinese character (artifact). Stock metaphor "whisper promises" and elevated diction ("liminal spaces," "ontological") in peak beats reduce immediacy. Sentence openings vary but information density is uneven; some lines do double work while others scaffold. Clarity is maintained but momentum sags during reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant template cadence and paraphrase loops throughout: "Each gear turned...their metallic surfaces gleaming" immediately followed by similar descriptive rhythm patterns. The phrase "after tomorrow disappears" appears three times without evolving function. Figurative language is dense but often ornamental: "distant memories in the wintersun serenity" stacks metaphor without clarifying. Multiple filter verbs ("watched as," "felt like") and participial openers create rhythmic monotony. The final paragraph loops back over already-stated themes (wonder, routine, mysteries) without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template cadence pervades: "the inspector lifted...," "the inspector watched...," "the inspector still performs..." across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences: "the pearl had already begun its ancient work" is immediately restated as "acquiring abandoned hopes he had buried deep." Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh inflection: "walls between hearts," "crystallized around his own," "emotional fortresses." The phrase "resonant hush" recurs three times without reweighting. Information density is low; many sentences perform thematic annotation rather than advancing action or interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is often vivid ("ivy curling around the beams like grasping hands," "spray misting his face"). However, phrase recycling weakens momentum: "daringly methodical" appears four times, "raw solace" twice, "truth-seeking river chronicler" three times, and "accordion bellows patched with tape" is a seven-word unit repeated verbatim multiple times. Paraphrase loops are present: "He'd stopped the medication to feel this, the raw solace of grief unfiltered" near-echoes earlier lines. Template cadence runs appear in the graffiti-tracing section. Stock metaphor "ivy...like grasping hands" and "notes cracking like ice" add small texture debt. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "the library of unspoken words" and "unspoken truths" cycle across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the middle third: "The watch began…," "The cipher began…," "The watch grew…" create parallel stems without taught pattern. Figurative density is high—"breathing softly," "temporal fissures," "glowing brighter," "tides"—without concrete grounding, bordering on purple in peak beats. Sentence openings vary adequately, but information density is low; many lines restate observation without advancing causality or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("velvet observatory swirled with deep indigo," "words tasting of mulberry ache," "molecular hum") without pattern-teaching or escalation; peak beats carry the same ornamental load as setup, flattening propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "perforated destiny" recurs in slight variations (holes in destiny, perforations in fabric) without added pressure. Template cadence in mid-section: "Clementine paused to pour… allowing the grounds to settle… The stains formed constellations…" stacks filter constructions. Stock metaphor: "sweet promise of what might yet be" in the final line. Mixed metaphor: destiny both perforated and planted. Applying artifact penalties: −0.6 for density without payoff, −0.4 for loops and template stems, total ~−1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, but several passages loop conceptually: "threshold of stillness" recurs three times without evolving meaning; "radiant hush" and "profound quiet" restate atmosphere; "lucidly watchful" appears twice as a label. Sentence openings vary, yet the closing paragraph stacks synonym phrases ("serene as the aurora, a silent guardian… waiting for the next spark") that paraphrase the premise rather than advance it. Figurative language is dense ("skyborne grotto," "emerald chip… a prison for the ephemeral") but remains legible. Minor template cadence in the final third: "She felt… She was… She floated…"

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity and grammar are clean, and sensory detail is specific ("bark as dark as midnight yet warm to the touch"). However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "Once she had been hesitant, once cruel, once betrayed" and the repeated "cycle of rebirth" across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. The phrase "antique hairpin" is used eight times, often in identical syntactic slots, creating mild churn. Several lines restate the same content without advancing knowledge ("The cycle of rebirth continued" followed by "rebirth was not something to escape but to embrace"). Stock metaphors ("winking like a star fallen from the heavens") and elevated diction in reflective beats ("umbral," "scalloping") occasionally clash with the straightforward plot actions. Applying paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties within Q7: baseline −0.6 for multiple distinct artifacts, plus −0.2 for churn concentration in the final third, totaling approximately −0.8, landing the score in the mid-5 band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the chime-selection beat. However, several constructions repeat stems: "He would…," "She was…" patterns appear in quick succession. The phrase "sincerely insincere" and "her wide, pleading eyes at odds with the rigid set of her jaw" exemplify overwriting—figurative density in a single descriptive moment without pattern payoff. Minor paraphrase loop: "her voice was barely a whisper itself" directly after "Ask him…her voice." These artifacts cluster but do not obscure closure (−0.6 in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and images are clear. "Weaves truth carefully" appears twice as unintegrated description (once in narration, once in the final paragraph). Minor paraphrase loops: "her voice trembling with realization" / "her voice gaining strength" covers the same emotional ground. Filter verbs ("seemed," "looked") cluster in the grotto description without voice motivation. Propulsion is steady but not dense—several lines restate Elara's trance state without advancing knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or interiority. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "This was it. This was the key" is declaration rather than dramatized discovery, and "no longer seeing them as bars but as resonant chambers" over-explains the shift. Figurative language is dense throughout without muddling clarity, though the closing sequence layers metaphor heavily ("each holding a story, a direction, a way through") in a way that risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied. However, several template stems recur ("Kael [verb]" × 4 openings; "The [noun] [verb]" pattern in exposition), and synonym loops appear ("automated systems" mentioned eight times with near-identical framing, "luminance" described as "lingering," "soft golden," "intensified," "began to fade" in close succession). The figurative claim "accommodates impossibilities" appears three times with identical phrasing, reading as a prompt echo rather than organic prose. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure modulates between action and reflection, avoiding monotony. Information density is adequate (each beat advances location or knowledge), but scaffold persists: "The forgotten library inside the sunken ship appeared like a phantom" and "Using the skeleton key, Orion opened the display case" are template-cadence transitions that dull momentum. Mixed metaphor in "meteor hush of lanterns...merged with the ocean's pressurized silence, creating a soundless symphony" contradicts auditory logic. Stock phrasing appears in emotional beats: "hiding behind truth," "narrow to this one purpose," "the only honest measure of human intention." No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, but figurative density in the ritual sequence (shimmering water, blooming colors, crescents of gold) blurs specificity without teaching a lyric pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paragraph-level loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "distill/distillated," "static bursts" (seven mentions), "backwards prophecies" (six mentions without escalation). Template cadence in the opening paragraph: "She had become... casting lots... Each coin echoed... through them, Elara sought." Figurative density ("ambered," "crystalline forests," "wavelength align") accumulates without causal pressure. The phrase "berediscovered" is a typo. Scaffolding ("her movements were quietly enthusiastic") declares traits rather than showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and several images are vivid ("bronze dome cracked like an old wound," "tentacles stiffened, curling like frozen flames"). However, pervasive paraphrase loops flatten momentum: "He had found the recordings… Now, the heartbroken reaper sought something more"; "He'd never allowed himself to grieve her, not until now" restates the premise mid-scene; "The reaper turned… Outside, the first stars pierced the twilight. The reaper stepped into the night" cycles without new information. Template cadence runs appear: "And you… you're 'Despair'" mirrors prior naming beats mechanically. Stock metaphors—"like a lover's sigh across an empty room"—and the final paragraph's summary scaffold ("The end" tag, redundant closure claims) dull the closure image. Deduct −0.8 for loops and template patterns, plus −0.3 for stock phrasing in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm in beats like "One drip every three seconds, then five, then two." However, paraphrase loops appear: "the world remained unbalanced, the river still dry, the silence unbroken" restates prior material without added pressure. Template cadence runs through several moves: "He had learned…he reasoned…he focused." Stock metaphors ("embers in ash," "wounds under a clumsy healer's touch") appear without transformation. Register drifts toward abstract ("cosmic imbalance," "fabric of reality") in peak beats where concrete image would sharpen. Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed: the bell's "forgotten song" and water "tracing edges" blur vehicle logic.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled, with strong imagery ("bruised moon," "mirrored hush," "photographs like stars fallen to earth"). However, several lines loop conceptually: "to protect the dam but to expunge the past, to redraw the boundary between memory and water" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the photo-placement sequence ("The first photo…The second…The third…"). The opening contains a minor contradiction (midnight vs. twilight). These artifacts do not obscure closure but reduce density and propulsion in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid imagery ("shattered light into a million dancing prisms"). Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates across beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Each noon, the birds performed their murmuration, creating fluid shapes" → "the starlings formed a particularly complex spiral" restates without added pressure. The final paragraph runs figurative language through most sentences ("fire and ice," "careful calculation of years," "touch of wonder") without pattern-teaching, creating density that slows the closure beat. Template stems recur in the opening ("had discovered," "had approached," "had learned") reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.3)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative or elevated language ("archipelago in a sea of fog," "threads of what others missed," "vacuum of freefall," "ghosts," "pendulum of rhythm") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.5). Template cadence runs ("The seeker adjusted...," "The seeker's mind...," "The seeker stood...," "The seeker smiled...") across multiple beats apply −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear ("patterns in constellations, whispers in static, logic in chaos" echoes "the patterns they sought" and "revising the stars into new constellations"). Information density is low—many lines restate the seeker's solitude and pattern-seeking without advancing situation. Cumulative artifact penalty in Q7: −1.2, and the final-third presence of these patterns disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "He'd survived ego death once, dissolving into the void and clawing his way back" ~10 words after "ego death survival" in the opening; "numbness" recurs nine times without varied embodiment; "the brain glowed" / "the brain's light" / "the brain pulsed" in close succession. Template cadence in the final third: "The clone was gone, but... / The numbness was gone, but... / The brain glowed..." applies identical stems. Figurative language is sparse, avoiding overwriting, but clarity suffers when the vivification mechanism remains abstract ("pouring his will"). Information density is moderate; many lines advance atmosphere without tightening choice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is lyrical and imagistic ("hourglass had emptied its final grain," "crushed a diamond in slow motion"), but several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and synonym churn. The middle section repeats the idea of sound-dislodging through multiple restatements: "coax that joy back," "dislodge something precious," "macerate the memory," "make it pliable again." "Mournfully eager" appears twice in identical phrasing. Some figurative language strains credibility ("concrete ribs" works; "shimmering residue" of laughter on a wall reads forced). The template "He [verb]" pattern runs through several adjacent sentences in the climax without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is controlled, information density is high, and figurative language is purposeful (glass-rose, captured vortex, frozen garden). Clarity holds. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The ache of his otherness was a constant hum" / "dimensional homesickness remained" recycles the same concept (−0.2). Template cadence runs: "He did not touch…Instead, he continued…His method began…" and "He turned…He let…As he internalized…" create a mechanical three-step pattern (−0.5). Stock metaphors like "a foreign star in his internal cosmos" lack fresh embodiment. Some overwriting in peak beats ("fierce and unyielding," "shimmering in-between") slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries several text-artifact patterns: repeated sentence stems ("The ember nexus pulsed," "The ember nexus at twilight"), synonym loops ("vivify/vivification" appears seven times, often in adjacent sentences), and template cadence in the approximation sequence ("The first approximation failed," "the third approximation revealed," "the fourth approximation bubbled"). Abstract diction ("suffocating destiny," "frozen bloom of realization") appears in most high-pressure beats without grounding in concrete action. The final paragraph stacks multiple thematic restatements that paraphrase rather than advance, and figurative language occasionally muddles sense ("frozen bloom amidst the ashes" mixes incompatible vehicles). Information density is low in the middle beats, where summary replaces scene.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm and imagery are controlled, with varied syntax and vivid specificity ("copper glinting serenely electric," "liquid silver," "gorge stretched into darkness"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: the "shard of hush" is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure; "beginning in every ending" recurs as label rather than evolving image. Template cadence surfaces in the closing paragraphs ("he knew he'd be back—always listening, always tuning"; "silence was never just silence. It was a story waiting to be heard"). These loops and the scaffold-like final summary ("The shard of hush had taught him...") dull momentum and trigger the artifact penalty, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clear and free of major grammatical errors. Sentence openings vary moderately, though several paragraphs begin with "Elijah" or "The ferry/radio," creating mild template cadence. Figurative language clusters in descriptive passages ("like waves in a multiversal ocean," "like morning mist," "like a maestro conducting an impossible orchestra") without pattern-teaching or payoff; two similes in the climax paragraph risk overwriting. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn, but information density is uneven—some beats advance action while others re-describe established facts (e.g., the hourglass "keeping perfect time" recurs without new pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the illusion held, then snapped back" is immediately restated as "thread falling limp"; "he realized… his approach was wrong" is followed by "connection wasn't about forcing… but about letting them breathe," a restatement without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "The sinew thread was gone… true connection wasn't perfect… as Siran walked away, the gallery's distortions seemed less daunting" stacks summary conclusions. Filter-verb stack in paragraph two: "felt tangible," "felt truly seen" within two lines. Figurative density—"spun moonlight," "weighted glass," "fractured light and sound"—crowds the closure beat without clear metaphoric coherence. Deductions: paraphrase −0.4, template cadence −0.5, filter stack −0.3, figurative muddle −0.3 = cumulative −1.5; artifacts touch closure, triggering −1.7 total and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Syntax varies purposefully and clarity is high throughout, with no pronoun ambiguity or tense slips. However, paraphrase loops appear: "benthic city" and "crushing depths" are restated across paragraphs without added pressure, and the phrase "balancedly curious" recurs identically in two beats as a label rather than dramatized behavior. The final paragraph stacks three abstract infinitives ("teaching themselves to navigate," "preparing for a journey," "had to begin tonight") in a template cadence that dulls propulsion at the closure beat. Information density is moderate—many sentences do one job—and the opening effectively anchors voice and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully and maintains momentum through the investigation sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "to protect vulnerable voices" recurs three times with minimal variation, and "persistently curious" appears twice in identical phrasing. The phrase "something that compelled Aria to protect vulnerable voices that might otherwise be lost to time and silence" (paragraph 2) is later echoed nearly verbatim in the final paragraph, a −0.3 penalty for redundancy. Mixed metaphor: "incidental heroism born not of grand ambition but of following where the evidence led" conflates birth with following without coherent vehicle. Stock phrasing: "profound gratitude," "something connected to," "something urgent to communicate." Template cadence in paragraph 5: "something important—something connected to." Overall density is solid, but artifacts cluster in thematic summary beats. Total penalties: −0.6 for loops and metaphor strain.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Strong figurative language: "each doorway a threatening mouth," "electric serpents," "crushing hush." However, paraphrase loops appear: the gold fleck's pulsing/brightening/blazing is restated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "She had come... but found instead" and "The gold fleck became... still tracking" echo each other structurally. The phrase "crushing pressure" appears three times. Minor filter-verb density ("felt herself beginning to dissolve") in the climax. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, but cumulative drag is present.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no mechanical template runs. Information density is moderate—many lines do double duty (heartbeat tracking + interiority anchor). Minor paraphrase loop: "The miscalculation Aris referenced had saved his life while ending hers, at least her physical one" closely restates prior exposition without added pressure. Stock metaphor appears in "spilled ink" and "captured dawn" without fresh vehicle logic. The final paragraph stacks abstract summaries ("finding not answers but peace," "survival itself is the wisdom") that dull momentum rather than propelling through image. No grammar errors; clarity is intact. Overwriting is mild but present in the closure beat, preventing higher placement.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("light fractured through its imperfect center into rainbows that touched the canyon walls like liquid sound"), but multiple metaphors per sentence in high-pressure beats risk coherence and slow momentum. Some paraphrase loops: "Language wants to live" echoed in "language wasn't dying—it was transforming." Template cadence in places ("The copper veins in their skin began to warm"; "The copper-veined storyteller smiled"). Information density is high, but overwriting in the final third—stacked poetic constructions—dulls propulsion. No catastrophic artifacts at closure, but pervasive embellishment lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.9)
    Phrasing loops and template cadence reduce propulsion: "The Jester had appeared after the missing return changed" recurs verbatim three times; "harmony untamed" appears thrice without evolving function. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to imply," "felt lighter") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy. Metaphors are vivid but occasionally clash: "wind chimes breaking in reverse" + "conduit" + phone metamorphosing into wood with a blinking eye. Stock emotional descriptors ("rage flared hot") and synonym churn ("cryptid," "creature," "being of paradox") add padding. Information density is uneven; the final third summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff ("her shadow trailing like a melody," "flowers opening like questions answered"), triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "She had uprooted their stillness" and "She had uprooted silence and planted symphony" restate the same core idea. Template cadence runs in the final third ("The orchard bloomed. The statues slept now… The city's hum had changed… The violinist's steps were light…"), reducing propulsion. The phrase "resonantly soft" appears four times, becoming a synonym loop rather than a purposeful refrain. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and applying the −1.7 penalty here.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully and rhythm accelerates during the EMP sequence ("thumbed the lead cap… silent crackle… three seconds"). Information density is high (storm-bottle mechanics, manifest gap, hidden compartment) without padding. However, paragraph two contains a near-paraphrase loop: "This search had made him respectfully rebellious" immediately followed by "a careful heretic who followed the rules only to break them more effectively" restates the same trait without added pressure. The closing paragraph's "he had not found… But in linking" cycles concept rather than advancing image, costing −0.3 for scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is lyrical but overwritten in places: "whispering gleam," "misting hush," and "chime of wind bells" recur as ornamental phrases without adding pressure. Several paraphrase loops appear ("silent carousel carpenter" repeated multiple times, "misting hush" in adjacent paragraphs). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction, creating tonal uniformity rather than modulation. Stock metaphors ("silence had become both his language and his canvas") flatten originality. The opening effectively anchors voice, but momentum sags in mid-section atmospheric description. "Devived" is likely a typo.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "stories live…as living, breathing entities" / "The stories lived here" / "the stories lived, breathed, and waited" recycle the same assertion across multiple beats without added pressure (−0.6). Template cadence: runs of "She [verb]" stems across seven consecutive sentences in the portal sequence (−0.5). Figurative language density is high in peak beats ("her footprints tracing theorems," "each curve a line of poetry") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating metaphor muddle (−0.4). The final third is loaded with these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Information density is low; many sentences restate the librarian's completed mission without advancing action or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence across the second half: "The whispering archipelago was no longer haunted…" / "The whispering archipelago was whole…" / "The whispering archipelago sang his name…" and repetitive "he had done it" / "some myths were not meant to be archived, but lived" / "some stories were not meant to end, but to illuminate." Applying −1.0 for loops and stems. Figurative language ("liquid memory," "shard of hope or sorrow," "warm blanket") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.5 for density. Mixed metaphors: light as "liquid memory" and "liquid" pooling in hands, then "swirling" on a palette. Cumulative artifacts yield −1.7 total; line debt (Q7 ≤7.0) disallows 9+ globally per cross-cap.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose density is high but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without escalation or pattern-taught payoff: "cosmic dust," "thin skin of reality," "tremor in the air," "impossible longing," "tide of impossible longing," "prayer of liberation." Mixed vehicle in "tide...pressing in from all sides" conflates liquid and solid pressure. Loop detected: "enveloped secrets" appears three times with synonym churn ("pressed," "intensified," "gone") but no added pressure. The line "another fragment healed, another quiet victory" mechanically summarizes theme rather than charging the image. Overall momentum is slowed by ornamental layering at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is mostly clean with purposeful metaphor ("light, bent and folded into impossible shapes"). However, repetitive sentence openings and template cadence appear frequently: "The fairy ring mushroom…" opens multiple beats; "Elara [verb]" structures recur. Paraphrase loops emerge in the penultimate paragraph ("how she'd slipped…how the beings…how they'd removed"). The phrase "decades later" is used twice in different senses without clarification, creating mild confusion. Figurative density is high throughout ("broken constellations," "chronophysics," "emotional logic") without clear pattern payoff, and some metaphors strain credibility ("tidal rhythms" affecting glass refraction). Clarity remains intact, but momentum sags under the weight of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and most beats are clear, but several paraphrase loops appear: "Neither fully here nor there, but suspended between worlds" restates the setup without added pressure; "succeed in her mission" and "the transformation completed" both summarize closure instead of dramatizing it. The final paragraph stacks three synonymous completions ("served its purpose," "fulfilled its function," "succeeded in her mission") that dull momentum. Stock phrasing clusters in peak beats ("darkness within," "emotional architecture").

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple sentences open with similar constructions ("She knelt," "She began to pull," "She lowered") in the ritual sequence, creating template cadence. Two adjacent lines near the opening restate her role ("she was not merely a pruner; she was a keeper of thresholds" / "weaving between worlds") without added pressure, a paraphrase loop. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "light that seemed older than the stone" is vivid yet the antecedent (what stone?) is unclear. No severe artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8 per the accumulation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Each knot unraveled released a burst of accumulated silence, the weight of years pressing" recaps the prior paragraph's "thick as a sailor's thumb and dark with years of accumulated silence." The phrase "accumulated silence" recurs five times without functional variation. Template cadence is visible in "Each facet scattered," "Each tangle held," "Each knot unraveled." One typo: "respresenting" for "representing." Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to soothe," "realized it was wound") slightly dull immediacy but do not pervade peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but template cadence recurs: "Elias [verb]" sentence stems dominate, and paraphrase loops appear (e.g., "ancient henge" repeated across adjacent lines; "methodically curious" restated as "perceptive nature"). Figurative density is high without always clarifying ("fresco vault curved like a question mark," "at the spot where a map tears" used both literally and metaphorically, creating confusion). Rhythm is monotonous; paragraph structure varies little. Information density is moderate, with some scaffolding ("As a methodically curious man") that could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (water pressing "like the weight of a thousand unspoken goodbyes," glitter "swirling with possibility") charges key images without excess. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. However, the three-transmission sequence introduces minor paraphrase loops—each follows the pattern describe-transmission → Elias-notes-tone → Arthur-comments—creating template cadence. The snow globe's three appearances risk decorative repetition, though the final swirl reweights prior stillness. No major artifacts obscure causality, but the prose occasionally favors elevation ("crescendo of panic to sudden emptiness") over immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level clarity is solid, with varied sentence rhythm and vivid figurative language ("white sea of vapor," "spectral shadows"). However, heavy ornamental layering in early paragraphs—multiple metaphors per sentence without pattern-teaching—slows momentum: "symbols of forgotten languages and mathematical equations that seemed to shift" adds texture but not pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "articulate unspoken needs" recurs three times across the piece, including the final beat, dulling closure. Template stems recur: "The [noun] [verb]" anchors many sentences. Apply −0.6 for combined loop and density issues, and −0.3 for closure-beat repetition of "articulate," totaling −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear in the opening ("always seemed a realm forbidden…yet here she was, summoned") and mid-story ("unfold the diary's secrets…unfolded the final pages…unfold the new pages"). Template cadence clusters in paragraph three: "unfolded the edges…unfolded the diary's secrets…Elara discovered…Elara understood." Register drift into abstract philosophical phrasing ("affectionate detachment," "profound connection to the joy that lay beneath it") clashes with the grounded elevator setting. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but scaffolding ("the diary's mysterious author," "the rigid hierarchy she had always accepted") pads rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive figurative overload in high-pressure beats: "the wind hummed a quietly explosive tune," "wound in the cerulean skin of memory," "clouds rearrange themselves into a perfect circle" pile metaphor upon metaphor without clarity gain. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines—"he sought to memorialize the void" / "he set the telescope down… and began to categorize the clouds anew" / "He memorialized the break by naming the clouds"—recycle the same conceptual action without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate: "He + past verb" sentence stems appear nine times in the opening half. Figurative density (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.4), and template cadence (−0.5) combine for −1.5 total; artifacts touch the closure beat ("clouds rearrange themselves"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the epilogue: "The library was gone, but its soul lived on" echoes "The city would forget the library, but Elias would remember"; "The coin's indentations" repeats across three paragraphs without adding pressure. Template cadence flattens key beats: "He knelt… He smiled… He positioned… He adjusted… He took… He staggered… He turned… He walked… He slipped… He rounded… He knelt… He stood… He walked… He whispered." Stock metaphors ("trapped sunrise," "ghost between buildings," "roadmap to infinity") cluster without fresh vehicle. Information density is low in the final third, where summary replaces scene. Apply −1.2 for loops and template runs touching the closure epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm; no template cadence or paraphrase loops across adjacent lines. Figurative density is moderate ("cradle for his breakthrough thoughts," "fibers of space-time") without muddled metaphors. However, multiple beats rely on abstract exposition ("realization dawned," "transform into profound connection") rather than concrete action. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("no longer just," "had become," "would soon redraw") that replace scene momentum with告知-only closure. Clarity is high but information density sags in the last third as scaffolding ("The starlings had shown him the way, the hopscotch board had preserved the knowledge") substitutes for dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades: figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("driftwood nostalgia," "lunar-eclipse locksmith," "hauntingly bright," "vortex," "kaleidoscope"). Paraphrase loops cluster in the second half: "fixing things—it was about fixing herself" and "not just for clocks or eclipses, but for the fractures in her own heart." Template cadence appears in the opening: "The frozen library... was a place... where the shelves were lined... and the air tasted..." Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her sanctuary, her masterpiece, her answer"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops in the opening: "noticed the presence" / "manifested" / "found the presence strangely trustworthy" restates shimmer-plus-trust across three lines. Template stems proliferate mid-piece: "They discovered," "They realized," "They mapped." The final two paragraphs are summary scaffold—"In the seasons that followed," "Years later"—that tell outcomes rather than dramatize a beat. Stock phrases: "vast emptiness of space," "gentle smile," "cosmic wink." Rhythm is competent but uniform; no sentence-level propulsion mirrors the discovery sequence's supposed urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops: "pane of hush" and "nested patterns" each recur 8+ times with minimal functional variation. Template cadence dominates: "As he ascended…," "As the porcelain made contact…," "When he reached…," "When the final ripple came…" The final third stacks filter verbs ("felt," "thought," "watched") and summary constructions ("had not prevented," "had succeeded," "had pledged"). Synonym churn on "lullaby," "hush," "ripple." Baseline −1.2 for pervasive loops and stems; closure beat is touched by summary phrasing, triggering the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and information density is generally high. However, scaffold phrases recur: "He had found it," "He heard movement," "When the traveler emerged"; template cadence across multiple beats. "Morning sickness had never quite left his system after inheriting" reads as unclear metaphor or biology error (pregnancy? nausea from curse?). The untranslated Chinese fragments "清晰的" and "晶体者" are clear text artifacts that obscure clarity. Some strong images ("frost kisses touched Tomas's fingertips") but loops and filter stacks ("He concentrated, leaving impressions") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and prose is generally clear, but the piece suffers from pervasive scaffold and thematic redundancy. "Symphonically minded" appears three times in near-identical phrasing. Multiple sentences restate the divergent-path theme without added pressure: the ravine's "parallel channels," Elena's "professional and personal worlds had diverged," "the divergent path" explicit statement, and the final paragraph's reprise. The phrase "loosened grief" appears twice in identical form. Template cadence is evident in repeated "Her [noun]" and "The [noun]" sentence openings across adjacent paragraphs. The closing beats deliver thesis statements ("metamorphosis was possible," "connection now flourished") that tell the resolution rather than showing it through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "her eyes hollow, her hands trembling" / "her voice fragmented" / "her face unreadable" / "her footsteps silent" cycles through synonym description without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates: "The woman nodded… Elias nodded… The woman nodded again… The young man nodded" in mechanical alternation. The phrase "mindfully scattered" appears three times in identical construction. Stock metaphors ("glimmering parole," "fragmented like the daylight") recur without reweighting. Line-level clarity is intact, but density is low—many sentences restate rather than build ("Elias's job was to bottle those untethered stories, which he did by quantifying absence, measuring the void left behind" explains the concept twice). These artifacts trigger cumulative deductions: paraphrase −0.4, template cadence −0.6, metaphor recycling −0.3, total ~−1.3 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with purposeful sensory detail and no major grammatical errors. Rhythm varies, and paragraph structure supports scene progression. However, figurative density is high in expository passages without pattern-teaching: "remorse collected like seafoam," "columns of regret reached," "liquid mercury." The fortress-as-Kael metaphor ("sturdy exterior…brittle fractures") is over-explained rather than trusted to image. Minor loops appear: "knowing his touch could transfer emotions" and later "emotional contagion in his touch," "desperate need to sandpaper rough memories with coarser ones" restates the same mechanism. Template cadence in backstory blocks ("He dreamed nightly…," "His motivation drove him…") flattens momentum. Peak beats (pavilion discovery, absorption) are vivid, but expository scaffolding before and after them accumulates to −0.8 total within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Her work to construct bridges...began fifteen years ago" / "Her motivation to construct bridges...had never been merely academic" / "What began as an abstract notion—to construct bridges from silos—had materialized." Synonym churn ("harmonious choral librarian," "empathetically decisive fingers," "vigorous tender quality") stacks modifiers without concrete action. Stock metaphors ("threads of community weaving") and label-only trait mentions ("empathetically decisive") appear in multiple beats. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −1.2 for loops and template stems across high-frequency beats, plus −0.3 for stock phrasing. Information density is low; many sentences restate the rehabilitation project without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 10–11 restate the synaptic-plasticity method; paragraphs 20–21 recycle the "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" motifs; paragraphs 28–29 repeat the transformation claim. Template cadence appears in "The engineer carefully…," "Elara trembled as…," "The archeologist of abandoned dreams was finally…" Stock metaphors recur ("sugar in hot water," "bridge between"). The text summarizes pivotal beats (years of research, the antique-shop insight, dawn recordings) rather than dramatizing them. Synonym churn: "modify" appears eleven times. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph loops earlier phrasing). Apply −1.4 baseline plus −0.3 for closure contamination; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "her unique ability to splinter perception into constituent colors" restates the prism-mind concept introduced two sentences prior. Template cadence evident in the fourth paragraph with repeated "she [verb]" stems across four consecutive actions. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh vehicle: "latent blaze," "seeds of vigilance," "serpentine grotto." Figurative density in the final paragraph ("refracted the coming sunrise into impossible new spectrums, heralding the dawn") stacks without causal grounding. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance description but few tighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with some vivid images ("ghosted melodies," "tapestry of sound"). However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "the sculpture's fractures trembled" / "the sculpture's song grew louder" restates effect without advancing it; "empathy in motion" recurs as a label across multiple beats without functional variation. Template cadence is visible in "She knelt… her fingers tracing," "She adjusted her grip… and continued to strum," "She stood… her heart light." Stock metaphors ("leaves rustling in time," "shimmering… before dissolving") and elevated abstraction ("resonant with possibility") reduce density at closure. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs (e.g., "by translating silence" repeated four times; "thoughtfully precise" twice; "eclipsed covenant" three times without added meaning). Template cadence in multiple paragraphs: "The [noun] had [verb]... The [noun] was... The [noun] seemed..." Stock metaphors ("the board that mapped the human heart") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to warm," "could see") dull immediacy. Penalty: −0.9 for loops and template stems touching closure paragraph. Artifacts in final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Their eclectic pacifism," "theatrical yet sincere," and "intuitively descriptive" recur as scaffolding labels. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "silences became measurable, each with its own frequency signature" immediately followed by "cataloging the varieties of silence." The final paragraph stacks three "the silence/the resonant/the frequency" constructions in summary rather than showing. Mixed metaphors muddle peak beats: silence has "shades and textures," then becomes "the presence of what sound cannot express," then "feels...like emotion...like the resonance of understanding." Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure breathes appropriately, with no major loops or template cadence. The opening anchors voice and the prose remains clear throughout. However, several beats rely on summary and stock metaphor ("impossible colors," "spider's web catching moonlight") that soften specificity. The final paragraph front-loads thematic articulation, reducing closure to exposition rather than image-driven resonance. Information density is moderate; many lines advance atmosphere more than character choice. No significant artifacts touch the closure beat, but the montage compression and reflective summary prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries moderate information density and clear spatial choreography, but several patterns dull momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "the orchard's resilience baffled agronomists" / "the orchard's resilience wasn't innate—it was learned" restates the same concept across beats. Template cadence runs in the middle: "The air smelled... / As she extracted... / The attribute was undeniable... / The echoes grew louder..." stacks filter-adjacent constructions without variation. The final third deploys stock metaphors ("a testament to survival written in stolen energy," "a harbinger of growth and consequence") and thesis-like summary ("she carried more than an artifact—she carried a lesson") that replace scene pressure with explanation. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for stock phrasing in the closure zone, totaling −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template-cadence runs appear across multiple paragraphs: "His [noun] [verb]..." stems repeat mechanically ("His current assignment required," "His rapidly adapting mind," "his expertise in rapid adaptation," "his movements economical"). The phrase "flight engineer's patch" recurs five times with identical or near-identical constructions, creating loop effect. Figurative density in early paragraphs—"artificial canyons," "monoliths," "vortex"—decorates without advancing causality. Paraphrase loops: "rapidly adapting mind" reappears as "his rapidly adapting mind" and "skills developed through years" within adjacent beats. Sentence openings lack variety in high-pressure final section. Information density is adequate but momentum stalls in the penultimate paragraph's summary of convergence components.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: nearly every line carries metaphor or elevated diction ("tapestry of hues and melodies intertwined," "sculpted hush," "symphony of possibility"). This creates sluggish momentum rather than propulsion. Template cadence is pervasive: "The bell ringer [verb]... The bell ringer's [noun]..." across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops appear ("oscillating between repose and urgency" recurs as "oscillating repose" without added meaning). The closure beat is dense with abstraction ("wondrous alloy of senses and silence") that dulls the image. Stock metaphors (colors as notes, silence listening) go untransformed.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports the journey's arc. However, pervasive overwriting dulls momentum: "avalanchingly quiet atmosphere," "the canyon hush deepened," "the fabric of reality began to fray like an old tapestry," and "shadows elongated and twisted, canyon walls shimmered with colors that had no names" stack metaphors in adjacent lines without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "failure was not an endpoint but a landscape" and "terrain of their past mistakes" restate the same concept. The final third sustains elevated diction through high-pressure beats (crossing the gateway, walking the terrain) where compression would sharpen impact. Template stems recur: "The Keeper [verb]" opens multiple sentences. No grammar errors, but information density suffers from figurative padding.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and information density is adequate. However, patterned artifacts cluster: "Between vanishing stars" appears thrice as refrain without escalating pressure; template stems ("He pressed," "He lifted," "He felt") recur across high beats; "transposed empathy" is restated in paraphrase loops ("observing others' feelings," "absorbing them wholly," "empathetic frequencies"). Stock metaphors ("like sugar in water," "fallen constellations") dull specificity. Figurative density in the final third obscures causality: walls "dissolve," revealing "consciousness itself."

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose maintains clarity and momentum without major loops or artifacts. Sentence openings vary, and figurative language ("ribbon of liquid silver," "morning mist") remains coherent. However, several beats rely on paraphrase loops: "extending brief encounters" recurs across paragraphs without advancing pressure, and "vibrating sympathetically" is restated in adjacent lines. The final paragraph summarizes the transformation rather than advancing through image, and template cadence appears in the opening ("adjusted… instinctively found… seemed to echo"). Information density is moderate—many sentences do two jobs (anchor setting, signal interiority) but few do three. No major scaffold or register drift, yet cumulative minor issues and summary-heavy closure prevent entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is mostly high, but the piece carries moderate overwriting: stacked metaphors ("shroud," "battlefield of yesterday's peace"), template stems ("He felt…," "He saw…," "He placed…"), and near-paraphrase ("not merely passive witnesses but active repositories" / "objects do indeed hold onto us"). The final paragraph summarizes rather than compresses, adding scaffold ("leaving Elias alone in the quiet aftermath of his profound discovery"). Information density is solid in the communion sequence but thins at closure, and a few figurative phrases ("patience that was almost tactile," "vibrant with borrowed life") lean decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The raveling silence lingered, but now it held a thread of hope, a spark in the darkness" immediately follows "she would not falter. The message had been sent, and she would wait, weaving, until the silence unraveled completely." Template-cadence runs appear in the final third ("The stoically sparkling bead was her compass, the puzzle edges her map, and the loom her voice" / "The hush of time's unraveling tapestry was no longer a barrier, but a path")—three parallel constructions in adjacent lines, apply −0.6. Stock metaphor strings ("threads of time," "fabric of existence," "tapestry") reduce specificity. Figurative density in most sentences of high-pressure beats ("The orchard blurred, the bamboo dissolving into mist as her loom became a vessel between realms") without pattern-teaching, apply −0.5. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disqualify 9+ globally and escalate Q7 penalty to −1.2 total.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.7)
    Template cadence pervades: "The silk had cost… but the aging magician had met… and nodded"; "not with sound or explosion, but with…"; "not meek, not proud, but…" This parallelism becomes mechanical rather than purposeful. Paraphrase loops cluster: "meek posture belying the quietly determined fire" / "meek blacksmith who had never spoken above a whisper" / "meek, not proud, but purposefully transformed" recycle the same contrast without adding pressure. "Azure defiance" appears in the satchel, Elias's eyes, and the arch's glow—stacked as symbolic wallpaper. Stock metaphors ("river of liquid night," "threads of azure light") and abstract nominalizations ("bartered awakenings," "silent rearrangement of molecular structures") obscure concrete action. The final paragraph's nested subordinate clause ("someone who had successfully coaxed resilience from the rubble around him—and perhaps from the rubble within himself as well") exemplifies overwriting that dilutes the closure image. Artifacts touch the ending; disallow 9+ globally and apply −1.2 within Q7 for template runs and loops across the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: "vast chamber hummed with the ghosts of machinery," "chaotic symphony," "flimsy membranes between realities," "profound resonance of a story finally, correctly told." Mixed metaphors appear ("memento of a debt paid...across the tear in reality's fabric"). Template cadence runs: "The green glass shard..." opens multiple beats; "His...," "He...," "The..." stems recur without variation. Paraphrase loop: "The withheld truth was no longer a whisper; it was a stone" echoes "heavy, dense truth filling a void" two lines prior. Stock metaphors ("tectonic plates," "river of causality") and filter-verb stacks ("he knew," "he felt," "he saw") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph's summary declarations), triggering cumulative −1.7 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops and template cadence across the piece: "The letters had been a lifeline, a way to protect…" followed immediately by "The letters had taught him that safety wasn't just…" (adjacent sentences restating theme). Stock metaphors pervade peak beats: "the sea could never quite fulfill," "fragile light within," "luminescent ache." Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to hum," "felt heavier," "seemed less menacing") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Register drifts into elevated diction ("desolation of the open sea," "testament to the luminescent ache") that clashes with the working skipper's presumed lexicon. Apply −1.2 for combined artifacts (loops, stock metaphor strings, filter stacks) per patterned-artifact penalty pack; disallow 9+ globally per the rule that artifacts in the final third trigger caps.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.7)
    Repeated phrasing and template cadence appear across the piece: "Kaelen would…," "The glass lantern wick…," "ancient shadows/wisdom/practice" cycle without fresh inflection. Paraphrase loops are evident ("performing this otherworldly routine" / "otherworldly routine gestures" / "His routine would continue"). Figurative language clusters heavily ("memories of futures not yet born," "dissolve like seafoam," "sang with light") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that slows rather than propels. The final third contains multiple near-duplicate claims about steering and continuity, dulling the closure image. Information density is moderate; many lines restate the central conceit without advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance image or state. Minor loops: "The wing did not just change color; it detonated with light. It illuminated in a silent, cascading wave" restates transformation. "Quietly explosive" appears twice within proximity without added detail. Template cadence in middle section: multiple "He saw how" constructions. Figurative language (prism metaphor, alchemy, beacon) coheres but appears in most sentences of the climax without pattern-teaching. Propulsion is strong overall; deductions prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is largely clear and rhythmically varied. Information density is solid; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "quantified sorrow" recurs in similar constructions without fresh pressure, and "the sextant's purpose" / "the device healed" / "the astronomer's tool" rotate synonyms for the same object across adjacent beats. Figurative language ("mundane miracle," "moonlight broke through the clouds, bathing the scene in an otherworldly glow") accumulates in the climax without mixed metaphors but edges toward stock imagery. Template cadence is minimal. The opening and closing lines bookend effectively. Mild scaffold detected in the phrase "the miracle as mundane as clockwork" (abstract label without immediate embodiment).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The keeper rose…The keeper's fingers…The keeper's breath…The keeper's hands…The keeper's chest…The keeper smiled…The keeper lay back" creates a drumbeat of identical openings across successive paragraphs. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: "notes shattering like glass," "seams of gold stitching their fractured reality," "woven dawns," "threads of light," "constellation in the sky"—mixed metaphors (weaving, stitching, threads, glass, constellations) accumulate without coherent vehicle. The final two paragraphs summarize thematic resolution rather than dramatizing it, diluting closure momentum. "The lute's final note hung in the air, and the keeper knew this was only the beginning" is scaffolding that tells what the scene should have shown. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−0.9) and figurative muddle (−0.5) for a total Q7 deduction of approximately −1.4 from a mid-6 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose carries several recurring patterns that dull momentum: "nestled paradoxes" appears three times, "crumpled invitation" is repeated, and multiple sentences open with "The" or "As" constructions. Figurative density is high throughout ("companion to her hesitation," "emotional boundaries," "thresholds to be crossed") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence in the final two paragraphs—"the bridge between...between...between"—feels mechanical. The phrase "enlarged by tranquility gained through necessary surrender" is strained and conceptually muddy. Information density is moderate; many lines do thematic work but advance little plot pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic with strong sensory specificity ("crust a perfect map of forgotten streets," "tiny prayers"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The world hadn't ended; it had only changed" echoes "The world moved on" without adding pressure; "tenuous absolution" recurs as a label rather than evolving in meaning. Template cadence runs in the final paragraph with repeated "The" openers and parallel constructions ("The tea warmed her hands," "The secret tea house was no longer," "The ordinary glowed now"). Filter verbs ("she felt the stirring," "she knew she had found") cluster in the closing beat, dulling immediacy. Information density is high in early beats but flattens into summary at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally strong, but multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "gently meticulous nature" (three times), "luminous vows" (eight times without functional variation), "quartz hush" (twice in identical phrasing). Figurative density is high without clear pattern-teaching or payoff—"crystalline," "ephemeral," "liminal," "quartz" cluster heavily in the opening third and dilute rather than charge key beats. Template-cadence runs ("The vows had been…The vows represented…") and stock phrasing ("her work completed the cycle") reduce momentum. Apply −0.8 cumulative for loops/scaffold and figurative muddle in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Emmie adjusted...Emmie clutched...Emmie retreated...Emmie slipped" creates a repetitive stem pattern across the story. Synonym churn appears in "wavered/stood firm," "thwart/expose," and "determination unwavering/desperation mounting." The phrase "comforting unease" is asserted without concrete embodiment. Mid-story summary ("For her second attempt...Again, she was discovered") compresses key beats that warrant dramatization, flattening momentum. Figurative language is sparse and stock ("echoed like distant thunder"). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot—but scaffold phrasing ("she was curiously steadfast," "she found herself moving") dulls immediacy. Artifact penalty: −1.0 cumulative for loops, stems, and summary compression of pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: "luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic," "emotional meteorology," "atmospheric arms" stack across beats, muddling clarity (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "her motivation brought her here" rephrases "seeking answers" from prior sentences (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening: "The tin compass ring…its emergent properties dormant until conditions aligned. Above, the aurora painted…" runs consecutive descriptive clauses without propulsion (−0.4). Register drifts into academic abstraction ("emergent properties," "atmospheric signatures") outside credible interiority. Information density is low in expository stretches; the forest-election conceit is described but does not advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "hollow ache" / "sorrow in his chest," "charcoal-fingered" / "charcoal-stained fingers," "auroral sorrow" recycled across multiple beats without evolution. Template cadence: "He reached… his fingers trembling… He rose… He would leave… He rose again." The final third contains heavy scaffold ("The broken lock… had been a metaphor," "The auroral sorrow had lifted"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching, and mixed metaphors appear: creativity "uncorked… like molten lava," lock as metaphor for a key he "turned." These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure beats. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for pervasive loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally solid (the map becomes a postal route; the plate contains intercepted messages). However, the piece suffers from template cadence in several beats: "She had first noticed," "Now, beneath warped floorboards," "Back in her workspace" use identical positional openers without voice motivation. The phrase "her calligrapher's patience serving her well" and "her calligrapher's sensitivity to truth" repeat the same stem structure. Stock metaphors like "gold in her veins growing dull" and "candor took root" flatten peak moments. The final paragraph's "terrible gift" construction reads as scaffolding that could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The symphonies of truth" recurs five times with near-identical phrasing; "glisten" appears four times in identical participial constructions ("glisten-ing," "glisten-ed," "glisten-ing"). Template cadence runs through multiple beats: "He [verb], [object]" structures repeat without variation. Figurative language crowds high-description passages without causal payoff ("the music of wonder played on, forever mute yet forever heard" contradicts itself). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the vigil," "the grand design") that clashes with the concrete task. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content (e.g., the fragment melts, then "now a mere sliver, its truth fully released" repeats the same event). Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and applying baseline −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "strangely organic" appears at least four times; "fragmented" and "chaos" recur without added pressure. Multiple sentences restate the same content—paragraph four describes emotional subroutines fragmenting, paragraph five repeats "fragmented wholeness," and later "fractured into a dozen pieces" echoes the same idea. Template cadence appears in the middle: "The android [verb]" opens consecutive sentences without variation. The final third mixes metaphors—fire "blooming like a rose," fears as "protective membranes"—without coherent vehicle logic. These artifacts dull momentum and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "unlocked the mailbox" / "mailbox now stood open"; "aged locket" / "locket's aged surface"; "vibrant" (courtyard, neighborhood) recurs without reweighting. Template cadence dominates the final third: "He turned… He closed… And as the first customer knocked, Elias opened it…" Stock metaphors ("tapestry," "canvas," "brushstroke," "masterpiece") cluster without fresh vehicle. The penultimate paragraph cycles through five abstraction-heavy declaratives in succession, each restating healing-through-listening without propulsion. Filter-verb stacks ("he heard," "he noticed," "he realized") flatten immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is mostly intact but paraphrase loops appear: "mysterious familiarity" is restated as "never been…yet somehow knew intimately." Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" openings. The phrase "calm defiance" recurs three times without evolving meaning. Figurative language (spider web, phoenix, dance-as-code) is vivid but stacks densely in the climax without clear causal linkage to the decryption mechanics. Momentum sags in the middle third with expository backstory (mentor's gift, shared joke) that tells rather than pressures present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with strong visual detail (salt crystals, lantern light, moving shadows), but multiple passages suffer from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "The wildflowers in the center of the chamber, their purpose fulfilled, their petals no longer ghostly but vibrant" recycles structure from earlier descriptions. Several sentences open with "The" or "She" in runs, flattening rhythm. Key moments—memory retrieval, gravity fluctuations—are summarized rather than dramatized in real-time action, reducing sentence-level propulsion. Stock metaphors ("charged with something more than salt and sorrow," "layers of reality itself") appear without fresh specificity. No single artifact touches the closure beat directly, but cumulative drag lowers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("drew bow," "starlight edges," "tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties. Paraphrase loops appear ("the prophecy was hushed" / "the prophecy's code was gone"), and template cadence runs ("The summoner [verb]" across multiple sentences). Synonym churn ("hush," "silence," "quiet," "stillness") substitutes for escalation. Mixed metaphors ("blaze" as "quiet," "cosmic" as "terrestrially small") violate coherence. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and applying cumulative deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and the prose has distinct texture. However, paraphrase loops appear: the opening establishes the seal among jasmine, then revisits it with "The seal...seemed warmer"; the lies motif cycles through "small, agreed upon lies," "The lies between them," and the final paragraph's explicit summary. The spatial teleportation is a clarity break. Template openings recur: "The tutor [verb]," "Elias [verb]," "The seal [verb]."

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery ("pearlescent interior catching the dying light," "silk-textured leaves"). However, several loops appear: "velvet garden" is repeated across paragraphs without reweighting, and the ritual beats recycle "activated," "emerged," "archived" in template cadence. "Charmed skeptic," "tragically radiant," and "ghostly resolve" function as stock phrases. The walk-through ("one by one," "hours passed," "by the time she reached") summarizes rather than dramatizing the closure beat. Figurative language is dense but not overwritten; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity is generally strong, but patterned artifacts accumulate: "heritage rose thorn" as unvaried full phrase across seven mentions; "calibrated treason" recycled verbatim; "wisely endured" appears twice in identical form. Template cadence in paragraph four: "She had wisely endured… Her motivation had become clear… The heritage rose thorn rested…" creates a declarative drumbeat. Mixed metaphor: "a key with no apparent lock" as both the ink formula and a final metaphor for resolution strains coherence—keys open locks, but the story uses it to mean both a secret method and a spiritual release. Purple prose in places: "memories surfaced like drowning bodies," "something between dream and reality." Deduction: −1.2 cumulative for loops, stem repetition, and figurative muddle in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with vivid figurative language ("serpentine nexus," "stone throats," "reed-blown melancholy"). However, overwriting accumulates: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction without breathing room, creating a steady wash rather than varied propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("the echoes returned, fragmented but clear" followed by "The canyon amplified their dissent" restates amplification). Template cadence runs: "He sang... He sang again... He continued his song... He lowered..." in successive beats. The final paragraph stacks abstract claims ("a chorus of awakening," "new melodies were always waiting to be born") that read as scaffold rather than concrete image. Apply −0.8 cumulative for density without payoff, loops, and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("scent of diesel and salt," "wind-pressed ice"), but multiple scaffold patterns accumulate: "her gift—whispering to ghosts"; "She called it her Window of Connection. Strange how its fractures…"; "They leave echoes," she explained…though she always weaves truth carefully." Paraphrase loops appear ("stories waiting beneath the surface, more truths needing exposure") and thematic labels replace scene pressure in the final paragraph. Filter-verb stacks ("would sit," "had been changing," "would learn") dull immediacy in expository beats. The phrase "borrowed starlight" recurs three times without reweighting, and "candle-lit shrine" + "melted snow globe" are named repeatedly without evolving function.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but overwriting pervades the piece: "scintillatingly somber" appears three times, "demure audacity" twice, and figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("living stars," "language she was determined to understand," "cipher written in light," "cosmic echo"). Mixed metaphor: fireflies as "language" and "cipher" and "map" blur coherence. Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "The" + noun + past-tense verb. Paraphrase loops: "her demure audacity had not been in vain; it had opened a door" restates across two clauses. Peak beats (loom discovery, return to parapet) are dulled by stacked modifiers and abstract summary rather than concrete action. Apply −1.2 cumulative for density, coherence slip, and template runs; final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    The text carries pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "sharply observant" appears twice verbatim, "Maya now understood" and "she now understood" echo within two paragraphs, and runs of "The [noun] [verb]" or "Maya [verb]" stems flatten rhythm. Stock phrasing ("against a sky perpetually hazed," "layers of convenient narratives," "something altogether different") and mixed-script artifact (分割其中心) disrupt clarity. High-pressure beats—letter reconstruction, final realization—are summarized ("piece by piece," "by the time") rather than shown in concrete action. Information density is moderate, but scaffold and synonym churn accumulate to −1.0+ in this category, and the closure beat is dulled by exposition rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (cobalt glass, storm, frequencies) is vivid in places. However, pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops dull momentum: "The lonely visionary had spent..." / "The lonely visionary pressed..." / "The lonely visionary would descend..." recurs mechanically. Synonym churn ("lonely visionary" × 3, "variant allegiance" × 2, "cobalt glass portico" × 3) and scaffold phrasing ("Elias felt," "Elias could see," "Elias knew") stack without tonal payoff. Key beats are told rather than shown: "Elias had subtly altered the frequencies" summarizes the climax instead of dramatizing the act. Register drift into elevated abstraction ("variant allegiance," "gritty whimsy") clashes with the concrete storm imagery. The closure paragraph contains three nested summaries that deflate rather than charge the final image. Apply −1.2 for loop density and template cadence; these artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean with purposeful imagery (music box "weathered to the color of regret," dunes "like a secret tucked under a tongue"). However, scaffold phrases recur: "dawn's earliest whistle" appears three times, "lonesome splendor" twice, and synonym loops cluster around "preserved," "captured," "rescued." The final third stacks summary beats ("From that day forward," "One evening") that tell rather than dramatize key turns. Template cadence in the closing paragraphs ("Each captured sound… each preserved fragment") triggers artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades: "azure-coat," "fleeting golden sunset," "hues of fire and forgiveness," "skeletal shadows," "fleshly and ethereal," "cathedral of ice" cluster figurative language without pattern-teaching or restraint (density penalty −0.6). Paraphrase loops: "not a door but a state of being" / "not of sound...but of vibrations"; "his mission complete but his vigilance renewed" / "knew his work was far from over." Template cadence in the final third: "The marina was...The engineer breathed...The key lay...As he walked..." (−0.5). Propulsion stalls under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose carries rhythm and textural specificity ("basalt walls absorbed and radiated pale winter light," "air cold enough to crystallize each breath"), but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "Softly purposeful movements" appears twice with near-identical phrasing; "the urgency of her mission and the patience it demanded" is later echoed by "meaningful change measured in generations rather than moments." Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh angle ("captured star," "celestial dance"). The final beat—"whispering to the restless hearts of the seven lakes"—relies on abstract figurative language that dulls the closure image's concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade the text: "The lantern's light flickered...The lantern's glow seemed to reverberate...The lantern's light wavered...The lantern's light steadied...The lantern's light reverberated one last time." Stock metaphors ("roots," "shackles," "armor," "stepping stones") appear in most sentences of high-pressure beats without transformation. Register drift into abstract diction ("entangled memories," "fortified vulnerability") weakens immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("declaration of independence," "silent promise"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages loop: "slow and deliberate" echoes "aptly deliberate" without added meaning; "apology" recurs five times across the piece in near-identical constructions. The phrase "vibrant hush" appears three times with minimal reweighting. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("honest tribute," "testament," "silent and true") that summarize rather than propel. Figurative language is controlled, but metaphoric vehicles occasionally drift ("splinter" for phrase, "bomb" for mechanism) without coherent tenor. No major artifacts obscure causality, capping deduction at mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe template-cadence debt: "Throughout the evolution of..." appears three times as a stem, creating mechanical repetition without pattern payoff (−0.6). Paraphrase loops cluster around "yearning algorithm" and "steadily curious," restating the same trait across paragraphs without added pressure (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("fractured images revealing patterns," "cascade of gears") and filter-verb stacks ("had been guided," "had developed," "had become," "had tried and failed") dull immediacy in high-information beats (−0.5). The opening sentence runs 64 words with nested clauses that obscure the subject's agency. Synonym churn around "curiosity" and "desire" inflates word count without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, with information-dense sentences advancing the mystery. However, multiple scaffold phrases and near-loops appear: "he found it anchored to something tangible" followed immediately by "he discovered a digital artifact"; "his motivation shifted" is told rather than shown; "knowing he couldn't ask directly" is expository throat-clearing. The metaphor "jagged scar in the network's official timeline" mixes wound and data imagery without coherent vehicle. Template cadence appears in the investigation beats ("He used... He trained... He found") with repetitive sentence openers. These artifacts do not obscure the causal chain but dull line-level propulsion, particularly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the piece: "Shael was a being of paradox" / "Shael was a courageous anomaly" restate rather than advance; "shadow-laced" appears five times as decorative modifier. Figurative density ("moments frozen in time," "crystalline tears," "butterfly wings influencing hurricanes") clusters without coherent vehicle or payoff. Stock metaphor strings and abstract high-level descriptors ("accumulated empathy," "authentic connection") replace concrete action in peak beats. The final third carries multiple artifacts ("mapping empathy," "weighted breath") that dull the closure image rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is dense ("salt, sorrow, and the strange, clean scent of melting bergs"), but the piece carries moderate overwriting in figurative clusters: "gripped reality loosely…slipping through his fingers like sand," "world suddenly thinner…seams where reality was poorly stitched," "frequency only a mind untethered from the present could detect" all appear in the opening, stacking metaphors without clear pattern-teaching. Mid-passage phrases like "fold in patience," "cumulative texture of a thousand small surrenders," and "untethered him completely" elevate diction in ways that blur concrete action. Paraphrase loop: "He believed that endings cast a long, audible shadow" followed closely by "trying to discern the hum of collapse, the specific resonance" restates the quest without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but density of abstraction in peak beats (the realization moment) dulls immediacy slightly. Apply −0.8 for figurative density and paraphrase in non-closure beats, plus −0.3 for elevated register drift in the Understanding line.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.6)
    Persistent paraphrase loops and template cadence undermine momentum: "The sentinel's purpose was singular" / "The sentinel's method was working" / "The sentinel's motivation was clear" / "The sentinel's task was complete." Figurative density in non-peak beats ("amber pavilion," "contemplative hush," "melody half-remembered," "passionate subtlety") reads as stock ornamentation. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes closure ("its work done, its message absorbed"). Filter verbs and scaffold phrasing ("seemed to hum," "the sentinel watched") dull immediacy without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled (the clearing "flickered like candlelight in a storm," the mask "gleaming like a crescent moon"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The whispers grew louder, swirling around him" is immediately followed by "The whispers quieted, their echo now woven," and the parapet's energy is described three times in close succession ("groaned," "shuddered," "stilled"). Template cadence runs: "He knelt... He focused... He stood... He turned" across adjacent beats. Stock metaphors like "tempest of forgotten voices" and "mantle" reduce specificity. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the final third, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple patterned artifacts cluster in key beats: "His motivation...was to transmute pain into a masterpiece" is thesis-statement phrasing; "the air hummed with an unfamiliar urgency, though Elias couldn't say why" is scaffolding that announces tension without cause; "heart thrumming a rhythm of earnest whimsy" mixes metaphor incoherently (hearts don't thrum whimsy). Paraphrase loops appear ("arcs began to merge...aligned...twisted and intertwined") and template cadence runs ("He would linger...his mind a loom...as vines climbed"). Filter-verb reliance ("seemed to lean in," "felt a shift") dulls immediacy in peak moments, and the final paragraph stacks summary generalizations ("subtle puzzle archivist of souls," "testament of...grace") that replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    Overwriting in the opening: "the first light finger the spines," "suspended hush, a stillness so profound it seemed to absorb all sound and breath" stacks figurative language without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loop: "this silence he had come to study, this quiet aftermath" restates without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the crystal's discovery paragraph ("It didn't just...it seemed to...to hold"). The closure beat ("Its work was done, its story told") offers clarity, limiting deductions, but density of ornament and loops in the first half trigger −0.6 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("sandbar eroding," "tidal longing," "ghost flitting at the edge of his vision"), but several metaphors operate at high altitude without grounding ("the ache for something just beyond his reach, a story he couldn't quite tell himself"). Two paraphrase loops: "the purpose washing out of him" / "the task returned" and "clinging to echoes" restated multiple times without added pressure. The final beat stacks modifiers ("low, mournful thrum," "jagged, flowing lines") and tells rather than shows the capture. Template cadence in the long opening sentence (multiple nested clauses) and throughout the middle section. Information density is high, but the prose occasionally sacrifices propulsion for texture. No severe artifacts, but the loops and elevated register in peak beats prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The clock hand was still, its purpose fulfilled, its chaos transmuted into survival" restates the prior sentence; "fragile eternity" and "luminous ache" recur without reweighted meaning. Template cadence appears in the closing run: "The observatory hummed on... And somewhere in the quiet hum... The sage camera repairer had fixed... The clock hand watched..." Stock metaphors (tools "gleaming like unshed tears," "stardust," "stars") flatten peak beats. Mixed metaphor: a hand "spinning with changelessly constant velocity" contradicts "frantic" and "rebellion." Figurative density in the final third obscures rather than sharpens the closure image. Total artifacts trigger −1.4 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact-penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple artifacts cluster in peak beats: "hymning the mundane" (unexplained method), "pulsing stillness" (abstract), and the final paragraph's thematic loop ("scent of hope" restated twice without added pressure). Template cadence appears in the opening: "The hospice wing hovered…its panoramic windows framing…the air carried…Today, the stillness felt…" Stock metaphor "bridge to the past, a thread connecting" is unearned. Filter-verb stack in closure paragraph ("seemed to deepen," "knew he'd done") dulls immediacy. Combined artifacts and loops warrant −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally; cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies appropriately, and the opening anchors setting and stakes efficiently. However, several paraphrase loops and template patterns weaken density: "quietly deliberate" appears verbatim in opening and closing; "sealed awakenings" repeats without evolving meaning; "loops" appears six times, often as conceptual placeholder. The phrase "Shadows no longer behaved; after spoons bent reality" introduces a vivid world-rule but "spoons" is never developed or explained, reading as orphaned quirkiness. Mixed metaphor: shadows "stretched and writhed" then "coalesced...half-formed and ravenous"—the physicality shifts without clear cause. The climax relies on abstract verbs ("forced," "sealed," "struck") where concrete action would sharpen the image. Sentence openings vary adequately; no major grammatical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies well, and no major loops appear. Information density is solid in the garden exchange. However, several phrases tilt abstract or use elevated register during peak beats: "imaginative sympathy," "yearned for the clarity," "cleft in certainty," and "fractures between worlds were meant to be navigated, not destroyed" (which borders on moralizing summary). "Shrewdly innocent" and "forgiving skeptic" recur as labels without fresh embodiment. The tooth "felt heavier" is a stock physical cue. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the figurative load in the final third slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy figurative density without taught pattern or payoff: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (grotto "coiled like a sleeping serpent," glass "pupil dilating in reverence," mist "bowing like a curtain"), creating atmospheric richness that obscures propulsion. Multiple paraphrase loops: "reflectively vibrant" appears three times with near-synonym phrasing; "zephyr bloom" recurs five times without functional variation. Template cadence in mid-section: "The sea glass... / The method was... / The grotto's walls... / As the memories resurface..." Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("seemed to sigh," "seemed to press," "seemed to smile," "seemed to hum"). Applying overwriting density penalty (−0.5), loop/scaffold penalty (−0.8), and filter-verb stack penalty (−0.5) totaling approximately −1.8, then disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong sensory specificity ("velvet moss," "liquid fossil of grief") and purposeful metaphoric layering that links technology and nature. However, several lines loop or overwrite: "honeyed hush" appears three times without functional variation; "watchful dreamer" bookends without reweighting. The opening sentence stacks three dependent clauses that slow entry. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph's parallel constructions ("systems that break," "networks or hearts or people," "circuitry and leaf venation"). Figurative density occasionally obscures rather than sharpens—"digital ghosts," "synthetic animals," "liquid fossil" cluster in the first paragraph without breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences: "against the current" recurs three times with minimal variation; "swirling hush" bookends without added meaning. Template cadence is evident in the collection sequence (poet/musician/child beats follow identical structure). Stock metaphors ("watercolor in rain," "waves against sand") and elevated diction ("solemnize," "ephemeral cameo appearances") cluster without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final paragraph stacks summary phrases ("broken vessel...conduit," "ancient ritual") that restate rather than advance. Applying −0.8 for loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor density.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades: figurative language ("threads of destiny," "liquid gold," "cascade of notes," "hymn of gratitude") appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.6 baseline. Paraphrase loops ("gathering hush" recurs five times with minor synonym variation; "golden stories" loops thrice) and template cadence ("The cricket stirred… Elias smiled… The harvest moon's glow intensified… the arbor seemed to lean in") across adjacent sentences add −0.5. Stock metaphors (moon as watchful, arbor leaning in, tears tracing paths) further dull line-level momentum. Pronoun references remain clear, but density is low—many sentences restate emotional or atmospheric state rather than advancing action or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template-cadence runs proliferate: "Kaelen had…," "The flash-paper alchemist…," "Kaelen demonstrated…" across consecutive paragraphs (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "patterns that preserved what could not otherwise be contained" echoes "resonance chamber for what would soon arrive" without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language clusters thickly in non-peak beats ("dimensions beyond human perception," "starlight to bend itself into vessels"), creating density without clarity (−0.4). Register drifts into abstract pseudo-technical prose ("organizations of light," "cartographic principles") that obscures the physical ritual. Information density is low; many sentences restate the alchemical premise without advancing scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but suffers from scaffold and paraphrase loops. "The timer mechanism" and "echoes" recur as stems across multiple adjacent sentences without variation. Several lines restate concepts: "the echoes were dissipating untapped" followed immediately by how "sound and memory struck different surfaces" covers similar ground. The phrase "not just X but Y" appears twice ("not just with gears but with resonant crystals," "not just sound, but the full resonance"). Figurative density is high in some beats ("frozen ripples in a timeless pond," "cartographers charted seas") but mixed metaphors emerge ("harvest," "cellar," "wounded season" all operating simultaneously). Template cadence in the mapping section: "Elian marked positions, recorded how echoes bounced..., how some angles amplified..." No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, but the cumulative line-level debt prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "boundary-lessly trapped," "whalebone reverie," and "shingled hush" recur without functional variation, creating decorative loops. Mixed metaphors ("whalebone reverie of the grotto") and elevated diction ("impossible geometries," "mathematical seasons") obscure rather than sharpen the transformation moment. Template cadence in the burden catalog (three parallel constructions) and paraphrase loops ("layered silence"/"layered awareness") dull propulsion. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the closure image, reducing density.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. However, pattern-taught figurative language appears in most sentences ("autumn rust-hued peace," "soft snow," "life-lines mapping possibilities," "herbarium of moments") without clear escalation, creating a texture that ornaments rather than propels at peak beats. Mild paraphrase loop: "both here and gone" is restated as "was and is" and "record and resurrection." The final paragraph stacks summary statements about theme rather than letting the completed carving image land. No severe clarity breaks, but density of metaphor in reflective mode slows momentum. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative density without pressure payoff and mild loop.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The lagoon had been his prison, but now it was just a place he'd been" restates the closure without adding pressure; "The carousel had halted, but the music—his music—was just beginning" recycles the opening motif mechanically. Template cadence in the final third ("The ghost was quiet… The lagoon hummed… The clouds closed…") flattens propulsion. Figurative language is dense but often mixed or vague: "traded them back to himself" lacks concrete vehicle. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, template runs, and stock metaphor strings in peak beats warrant −1.2 within Q7, with an additional −0.5 because artifacts touch the closure beat (total −1.7). Starting from a mid-6 baseline, total deduction brings score to 4.7. Final third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence dominates the middle: "She worked silently… She redirected it… The water flowed, then pooled, then began to creep… Elara watched… She placed it… Elara stood… She smiled… Elara picked up." Paraphrase loops recur: "maze of intentions" appears five times; "stoic wonder" thrice; "functionally creative" twice. Stock metaphors abound: "ghost of its own former joy," "last heartbeat of a bygone era," "ashes," "threshold." Applying the artifact penalty pack: template stems (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.4), stock metaphor strings (−0.4) cumulate to −1.4 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat (final paragraph recycles "maze," "threshold," "humble navigator"), which triggers disallowance of 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear throughout: "The introverted clock scribe" opens three sentences in close succession; "excruciatingly gentle/gently" recurs without variation; "glacial hush" and "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" are repeated verbatim across paragraphs. The final two paragraphs restate the reconciliation theme with synonym churn ("no longer just a clock scribe" / "still bear the title of clock scribe, Elian now bore his abandoned dream"). Information density is low in reflective passages, and scaffold phrases ("something had shifted," "For the first time in thirty years") dull momentum. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the lower-band artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean with strong propulsion and varied rhythm: short declaratives ("This was it") punctuate longer contemplative sentences effectively. Information density is high—most lines advance situation or characterization. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is controlled: "bruised purple," "tenacious grip," "fossil blueprint" are specific without overwriting. Minor register drift in "recontextualized" feels slightly academic for the moment's charge, and "the architecture of lies" recurs three times across the piece without evolving meaning, creating mild redundancy. Opening and closing images are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is generally high, with clean grammar and spatial choreography. However, several paraphrase loops and ornamental repetitions flatten momentum: "fog rolling across the harbor, thick as breath" is restated as "fog silvered the air" and "fog swirled" and "fog retreated" without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("frozen scream," "quiet, brilliant heart") and template cadence in places ("The fog swirled… The rope's patterns grew… The fog retreated") create mild template-pattern debt. The figurative density is high but not muddy; information advances steadily. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and stock phrasing, preventing entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (image + theme). However, paraphrase loops appear: "explained absences" recurs four times across adjacent paragraphs, and "geography of healing" appears twice in close proximity, both as scaffold. The final paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("profoundly lonely and breathtakingly present," "endless journey toward understanding") that blur specificity. Minor template cadence in the middle ("His ability...allowing him to connect"; "People often said...like seeing") but not pervasive.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose carries vivid images (obsidian egg, crystalline floors, light-and-shadow creature) and varied sentence rhythm in the opening. However, the piece exhibits multiple loops and scaffold phrases: "quaking reverie" appears three times, "painfully sweet" twice, "flawed genesis" three times, and template cadence runs dominate the middle ("The copper wires hummed, and the tangled thread began to unwind… The machines whirred louder… The copper wires sparked, the prism fractured, and the thread tightened"). Stock metaphors ("like a jewel dropped," "like a cathedral's arches," "slithering toward the egg like a snake") cluster without fresh inflection. The final third stacks summary constructions ("The bird's song was…," "The flawed genesis was…," "The prince closed…") that dull propulsion at closure. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack (paraphrase loops, template cadence, stock metaphor strings across peak beats): baseline −1.0 in Q7; because artifacts touch the closure beat, escalate to −1.7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax. Metaphoric density is high ("kelp-drift peace," "coin a small arc of red") but remains coherent. Two frictions: the phrase "scars could sing" is repeated across beats without evolution (paraphrase loop), and the final paragraph stacks summary-like constructions ("not as a curse, but as a tool," "no longer wounds but notes") that dull immediacy. These do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion at closure, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is overwritten with figurative density in nearly every sentence ("slick with the ghosts of water," "thoughts shimmered like trapped starlight," "secrets inside had long since given up trying to escape") that dulls momentum and creates register drift. Paraphrase loops recur: "the box trembled," "the box grew heavier," "the box began to warm," "the box snapped open"—four beats that restate the same content (box reacts to discovery) without added pressure. Template cadence: "He knelt... He picked it up... He remembered... He followed... He knelt" structures action in repetitive stems. Synonym churn for "unstick" (liberate, free, release, trapped) and stock metaphors ("sharp ache of loss," "pure, unfiltered light") further reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles: "the garden's rhythm faltered" / "break the cycle" / "disrupt the patterns" rehash the same concept across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in the middle third: "The gear began to glow... The gear whirred... The sentimentalist stepped back..." Sequential actions with identical structure. Stock metaphors: "silent prayers," "river of memories," "fragile, fleeting thing." The phrase "Canada edges" is either a typo or incomprehensible artifact (−0.8 for artifacts touching clarity). Information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or character.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density is solid, with most sentences layering image and interiority. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the final third without clear pattern-teaching, diluting urgency: "thundering calm," "spectral wings," "cathedral of life and death," "fierce and quiet understanding." The closing paragraphs lean toward scaffold ("he felt the weight...settle not as a burden, but as a connection") and thematic summary that dilutes propulsion. Apply −0.4 for density and register drift in peak beats, landing in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm is controlled and varied; imagery is vivid ("polished surface reflecting the churning sea"). Information density is high in the opening and closing beats. However, several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the pause was over, but something had fundamentally shifted" follows "a faint vibration… the pendulum began its descent"), synonym churn ("minuscule offering," "microscopic acts," "tiny inscriptions"), and template cadence in mid-section ("He was not fixing… but healing… ensuring…"). Filter-verb stacks ("he knew," "he saw," "he had devised") dull immediacy in reflective passages. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally clean, but several text artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the time has come" / "if he didn't act quickly"), template cadence in adjacent lines ("The silo opened… shelves ran… At the center stood"), and figurative overload in non-peak beats ("velveteen gloom that clung to the circular walls like memory itself"). Momentum sags mid-piece with expository interiority that recaps rather than advances. The closure beat is clear, preventing deeper penalty, but artifacts touch multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is often vivid ("liquid starlight," "machines powered by laughter"), but paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "ignorance now a map" / "his ignorance replaced by quiet confidence" / "his ignorance now a map, his imagination a seed"; "The quill's feather flickered" / "the kingfisher's legacy now imbued with purpose" / "its essence woven into the future's fabric." Template cadence appears in multiple runs ("He was…," "The cartographer…," "The quill…"), and the final paragraph stacks near-identical constructions ("his ignorance now a map, his imagination a seed, his legacy a story") that read as thematic checklist rather than propulsion. These artifacts dull the closure image and lower information density, though no single loop obscures causality entirely since causality is already thin.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but the prose carries significant line-level debt. Template cadence and paraphrase loops proliferate: "The broadcast's singer never spoke, only sang" / "The broadcast's voice was gone, but the dust remained aglow"; "Elias smiled, his work complete" / "His diligence had paid off"; multiple sentences open with "The broadcast" or "Elias [verb]." Stock metaphors ("mist curled around him like a cloak," "dust like velvet") and abstraction ("renewed magic," "luminous quiet," "thistled calm") flatten the closure beats. Information density is uneven: the middle third moves briskly, but the final quarter recycles the same image (dust glowing, stories whispering) across four paragraphs without new pressure. Filter-verb stacks in the climax ("He'd been," "he realized," "he began to hum") dull immediacy. No single artifact alone disqualifies higher scores, but the accumulation—particularly in the final third—crosses the −0.8 threshold and triggers the artifact cap that disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("like a dying heartbeat," "like rustling leaves," "like a promise"), near-synonym loops ("brittle and beautiful," "sharp and unyielding"), and paraphrase chains (e.g., the mask described three times in adjacent paragraphs as fragments/shards/mosaic without added detail). Template cadence: "The mask was X. The gallery Y. Elias Z." recurs across multiple paragraphs. Figurative density—almost every sentence carries simile or metaphor—obscures propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("somber marvel playing on his lips"), triggering the elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent sentences: "competing narratives" is restated multiple times, and "preserve ancient methods" / "preserving ancient methods" recurs without adding pressure. Template cadence is visible in repeated "Sebastian [verb]" sentence openings. Stock metaphors ("truth is the first casualty," "truth survives") flatten originality. The Chinese dream sequence is a scaffolding artifact that interrupts rhythm and obscures causality—its function is unclear and it dulls the surrounding beats (−0.6). Information density is uneven: the middle third front-loads exposition (saltwater fauna, calendar contradictions) without immediate scene consequence. Clarity is mostly maintained, but momentum drags during reflective blocks that do not constrain present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, yet the piece deploys filter-verb stacks ("she had told," "she had painstakingly transcribed," "she whispered") and paraphrase loops across adjacent beats ("By subtracting noise" appears three times with near-identical framing). Template cadence runs: "The zither soundhole rosette [verb phrase]" and "By subtracting noise [consequence]" create mechanical repetition. Stock metaphors ("autumn amber," "bridges across divides") and therapy-speak ("self-consciousness," "inherited grievances") in peak beats dull immediacy. Combined artifacts trigger −0.9 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb stack rule, capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and vivid imagery ("iridescent light that shifted in response to Elara's emotional state"). However, the story suffers from moderate paraphrase loops: the greenhouse as sanctuary/rebellion is restated across multiple paragraphs, and the plant's growth is recounted in adjacent sentences with synonym churn ("emerged...unfurled...grown"). The pruning sequence contains template cadence ("With each careful cut...The cuts healed instantly...the plant's structure becoming"). Figurative density is high in non-peak beats ("dissolved into light that joined the growing chorus of cosmic resonance") without clear pattern-teaching, triggering the overwriting check. The final paragraph stacks abstract claims rather than concrete propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is generally high: the opening establishes character, curse, blackout, and drones in one paragraph. However, several beats loop or restate: "the one secret he'd managed to keep" and later "his own lacquer box" redundantly anchor the same object; "his honesty forcing him to add" feels like scaffolding. The phrase "nectar dusk" appears twice as a poetic placeholder without advancing pressure. Figurative language is dense in non-peak beats ("flickered out not with a bang, but a sigh") but doesn't obscure causality. No major artifacts touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "compressed magnitude of quiet that vibrated through his bones like auditory gold," "hushed blaze—a quiet intensity," "streetlights… drowsy transformation… silent dreamers" stack metaphor without coherence. Paraphrase loops: "houses… hum with an inner life while others merely exist as empty shells" restated as "some houses are simply more awake than others." Template cadence in displacement sequence: "The teacup, he positioned… A window latch he moved… Finally, he placed…" Scaffolding ("as he would later call it," "of course") and stock phrases ("liminal moments") dull momentum. Artifacts touch closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but several loops and scaffold phrases appear: "not for destruction, but for understanding" / "not as conquerors, but as mourners" / "not a probe... not through their device, but with his own" creates a template cadence across three beats. "The revelations had not ended; they had just begun to flow" is a paraphrase of the prior cascade image. Elevated diction ("stolid," "phosphorescent," "filament") occasionally clashes with the voice's stone simplicity. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the chime-strike lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally high, but the prose carries noticeable scaffold and loops: "The infinite staircase" appears seven times, often in consecutive beats; "grim optimist" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment; "texture of a missed opportunity" is repeated verbatim. Paraphrase loops touch the ending ("not as a trap, but as a choice" / "not by escaping… but by embracing"), and the final three paragraphs recycle closure-summary phrasing. Template cadence ("The dice… The chipped die…") and stock metaphor strings ("fragments scattered like dust") dull momentum. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack (loops, label-only traits, stock metaphor strings present; final third affected): baseline −0.8 in Q7, escalated to −1.2 because artifacts appear in closure beats. Additional cap triggered: disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the rule.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (moon-tipped brush, magnolia leaf, silver dust). Information density is high in the painting sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Her motivation was an abstract, almost desperate need" is immediately echoed by "methodically hopeful spirit refusing to concede"; "the language she sought" is restated as "spoken through sensation instead of sound" and again as "lost languages made visible." Template cadence in the final paragraph ("She had roused…she would try…she placed") accumulates across three beats. Figurative density ("moon-tipped," "saffron quiet," "roadmap of sorrows," "moths' wings") in most sentences of the opening third feels ornamental rather than pattern-taught. Apply −0.6 for loops and −0.3 for cadence, total −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lyric and textured, with strong images ("honeyed sunlight," "yeast and grief"). Overwriting clusters in multiple beats: "a world where displaced persons were not a condemned tribe but a temporary inconvenience" and "a brief and fleeting thaw against the encroaching despair" stack abstractions without advancing pressure. The final paragraph loops concept: "communion of loss and determination" is restated as "fragile, rosewater-scented hope of thaw." Figurative density is high throughout without a taught pattern, triggering −0.5 in Q7. Paraphrase loops ("each shift... a fracture," "each change") and template stems ("She reached... She thought... She bit") add −0.3. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong figurative language in many beats. However, density issues appear: several sentences restate the same idea ("not a maker of clocks but a master of time," "the puzzle he had once sought only to solve"), and elevated metaphors cluster heavily in the final third ("galaxies that had no name," "void of perfect silent nothingness") without adding pressure. The paraphrase loop around "stepping beyond" and "counter-clockwise" triggers −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "distorted" is repeated across adjacent lines without tonal shift, "lingering luminance" and "glow" cycle without added meaning, and template cadence ("The [noun] had [past-tense claim]") recurs in exposition-heavy paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("dying star," "white-hot," "brush and medium") clutter the climax without sharpening the image. The final two paragraphs summarize the transformation ("I understood," "I realized") rather than dramatizing it through action or sensory change, flattening momentum at closure. Minor grammar slips (missing commas in compound predicates) and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to expand," "began to dissolve") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence throughout: "Each obstacle found its note, each challenge its rhythm, each impossibility its harmony" mirrors earlier "part prayer, part rebellion, part mathematics"; "whether storms or stillescence, whether the floating circle would spin or drift" and similar structures recur mechanically. Stock metaphors ("cosmic sonic origami," "mathematics of the impossible") cluster without earned specificity. Information density is low—multiple sentences restate transformation without advancing scene pressure. These artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ globally and triggering −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clear and maintains momentum, with strong images like "the shell beneath gave way, revealing not marrow or bone, but a cavity" and "sunset painted the shell-city in hues of orange and violet." Information density is generally good, though some lines restate: "The watchers—she was certain they were connected to his expedition, or perhaps were the expedition themselves, transformed" is followed by the parchment confirming this redundantly. Template cadence appears in summary stretches: "Days turned into weeks as Elara became quietly driven" and "In the coming weeks, Elara communicated regularly." Stock phrases like "to her astonishment," "with trembling hands," and "taking a deep breath" recur at emotional peaks. The overwriting is moderate but noticeable in the final third ("listening for the return of pattern languages beyond the rusted gate, one quietly driven question at a time"), where figurative density rises without functional payoff. No paraphrase loops or severe artifacts, but the line-level polish isn't tight enough for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are frequent: "repository of deceit, where noble lies had taken root" echoes "suffocated reality"; "truth has a way of surfacing" / "truth would hurt, but...it was necessary" / "truth would be hard, but it would be true" cycles the same assertion. Template cadence in the opening third: "He pushed...He moved...He pulled...He thought...He closed." The ivy/rosebush metaphors are stacked within three paragraphs without added pressure. Filter-verb reliance ("seemed to breathe," "thought of") dulls immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully and information density is high in observational beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "gaps where memories had once existed" is restated as "interlaced absence...gaps between memories and reality" without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph ("his legacy formed...in foundations preserved, in notes left") and elevated metaphor density in reflective passages ("bruised canvas," "hued blaze," "crystalline puzzle pieces") begins to ornament rather than propel. The "wrest" motif recurs three times, two functional, one decorative. No major clarity failures, but momentum dips in mid-story reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high and the prose maintains momentum without major loops. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and figurative language ("dappled shadows," "constellations in the darkness") serves atmosphere. However, multiple instances of prompt-echo phrasing appear: "tranquilly perceptive nature," "dappled resolve" (twice), "reclaimed stillness," "honest origins," "antique ink stamp" recur as labels without variation. Template cadence in the middle section ("He ran his fingers," "He formed," "He took out") and minor paraphrase loops ("masterpiece of preservation—a sanctuary built to save knowledge") reduce density. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting the deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character state or the polishing ritual. Sentence openings vary adequately, though a few adjacent lines in the polishing sequence share similar stems ("He applied," "He focused," "He would polish"). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; the description of the quartz transformation is clear and propulsive. The metaphor of "luminous torment" and "tearing her dream apart, piece by piece, to give each fragment a new body" is coherent and purposeful. Minor issue: the phrase "a sliver of smoky quartz, polished to a gem-like translucence" in paragraph four slightly echoes the later "sharp and clear, a captured shard of a moment," creating minor textural redundancy. The final paragraph drifts slightly toward summary ("It was precision and pain") where a concrete image might serve better, but does not obscure closure. Overall clean with room for tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("wreckage of the man," "mathematics and metaphysics merged," "theology of the potential realm") without taught pattern or escalation, creating overwriting that blurs clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "what might have been, what could be" recurs with synonym churn. The final beat stacks abstraction ("anticipatory horror and ecstasy," "intangibly, tangibly") without concrete image. Template cadence is present in mid-section beats ("The monitor displayed… His bride's laughter echoed… These were places…"). Information density is moderate; many lines elaborate concept rather than advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence runs appear throughout: "The drone lifted," "The chip's metallic surface seemed," "The missing pieces," "The drone suddenly stalled," "The drone responded." Paraphrase loops in paragraph two: "how their career had evolved" immediately followed by reflection on the same evolution. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (barrier encounter) stacks without payoff: "shimmered between Earth and sky like heat haze with purpose" followed by "Brilliance and dimness swirled together...as if time itself was being called into question." Stock metaphor: "missing pieces of a larger whole." These artifacts collectively trigger approximately −1.0 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive. Opening line ("cobalt terrace stretched before Elias like a frozen sea, the same color as his regrets") establishes voice and stakes. Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence. Information density is high in the confession sequence. However, **paraphrase loops appear**: "The guilt had settled in him like a disease" (para 5) and "I can't quell the guilt anymore" (para 25) restate without added pressure; "the weight of unspoken words" (para 2) and "under the weight of everything they didn't say" (para 8) loop conceptually. "Sieved hush" recurs three times but shifts meaning only slightly. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 8: "felt the urge to quell" could be tightened. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats. Apply **−0.6** for loops and **−0.2** for filter stack = **−0.8 total** in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    Clarity is generally high; no major grammatical errors or spatial confusion. However, the prose suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing: "transformation, not just transaction" is restated as "untethering…from hatred," "liminal space" is glossed as "the precise territory where he worked," and the drawer pull's symbolic function is explained three times across paragraphs two, four, and six. Template cadence appears in multiple "Julian [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" openers without taught pattern. Figurative language is dense but sometimes mixed: "mist curled…like fingers" then "beading on…coat" shifts the vehicle mid-image. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate prior content without adding pressure. Line-level penalties accumulate: paraphrase loops (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), register drift in peak beats (−0.3), totaling approximately −1.2 in Q7, with artifacts present in the final third disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and most lines advance; "the backlash of regret needed no formal validation for consumption" and "merrily melancholic facade that fooled everyone but herself" show density and specificity. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the backlash of her last voyage had left her professionally broken" restates the opening title's loss, and "unable to trust the instruments" / "her ability to read celestial arrangements had evaporated" cycle the same content. "Expectations had collapsed like dying stars" and "compass whispered to her from its pocket prison" push figurative density in adjacent beats without pattern payoff, triggering mild overwriting. The final paragraph summarizes closure ("hours later," "understood it wasn't about") rather than showing the decisive moment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and carries a consistent rhythm, but several patterns dull momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "The procedure had wiped him clean…leaving a void" is immediately restated as "the past lingered in the shadows." Template cadence runs through the mid-section—"He pulled…He waded…He held…He pressed"—stacking subject-verb openers without variation (−0.5). Stock metaphors recur: "memories…festered like wounds," "ship scuttled in a storm," "spark where none had ever been." The closure beat abstracts into "the light swallowed him whole" rather than landing on a concrete image with propulsion. Information density is moderate; several sentences do double duty (bioluminescence as both atmosphere and metaphor), but the scaffold phrasing and loops accumulate to −0.8 total, with artifacts touching the final third, disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but the piece suffers from figurative density without pattern payoff: "embers of possibility," "sounds that had become her native tongue," "smoke twined upward," "translucent and real," "essence of her companion" stack without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops appear ("understanding demanded sacrifice" / "conjure the dead required not just magic but surrender"; "transformed yet unchanged" recurs). Template cadence is present in the transformation paragraph's stacked participial openers. These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the metamorphosis beat, which should anchor closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with multiple metaphors per paragraph ("robes flowing like spilled midnight," "time pooled like liquid mercury," "beauty that chokes"). Some constructions blur clarity: "willingly perplexed, choosing the mists of uncertainty over the sharp edges of grief" stacks abstractions. The piece avoids paraphrase loops but contains templated syntax in the middle section (repeated "The cartomancer + [verb]" openings). The first-person slip and some abstract phrasing reduce propulsion in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clarity and grammar are strong; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. Information density is high in the search and stitching sequences. However, paraphrase loops appear: "hours passed in ghostly resolve, Elara's determination unwavering" and earlier "her feet barely touching...when joy touched her heart" both summarize persistence without advancing pressure. Stock phrasing weakens texture: "memories of a species," "vast emptiness between worlds," "essence of divine mercy." The phrase "peculiar trait" recurs as scaffold. The final paragraph stacks summary sentences ("would not survive," "might yet emerge," "served the greater good") that tell outcome rather than image consequence, dulling the closure beat's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "the whispering hush," "vibrant hush," "slow dance of celestial bodies" each recur without variation or reweighted meaning. Sentences often restate rather than advance: "Show me the change I can't see" followed immediately by the bug flying "like a rogue star" and then "the whispering hush grew louder, not in volume but in meaning" without specifying what meaning. Stock metaphors ("moth to a flame," "rogue star") and synonym churn ("rumbled softly," "rumbled again, this time louder") flatten momentum. The final third stacks summary-like beats ("he laughed," "he smiled," "he walked away") that tell emotional resolution rather than showing a single charged image with information density.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "Elena had always been calmly inventive" / "Elena's calmly inventive mind raced"; "the bronze quill holder...felt cool" / "the bronze quill holder...its cool metal"; "the blackout was no accident" / "the blackout was intentionally triggered." Template cadence dominates mid-story ("Elena approached cautiously...Elena discovered...Elena had always felt...Elena paused"). Stock metaphors ("cradle of sparks," "winking hush") appear without transformation. Sentence openings repeat stems across adjacent lines. Aggregate artifact penalty: −1.4 in Q7; artifacts appear in final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is concrete. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching: "liquid silver," "translucent auroras," "shimmering curtains," "cascading visions," "violet and emerald fire" cluster through peak beats, creating decorative density that slows propulsion. Template stems appear: "The herder [verb]" and "As she [verb]" recur without variation. Paraphrase loops exist: paragraphs 2 and 5 both restate "sacred patterns" and "promise" without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "scars… a map" / "scars were not so different—maps survival etches"; "cartography of scars" recurs four times without added pressure. Template cadence: "He felt… he mused… he wondered… he smiled" across consecutive beats (−0.5). Register drift into elevated diction ("rarefy," "liminal," "cartography") clashes with the urgency of the vigil (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("clouds like ink," "wound reopening") and filter-verb stacks in high-reflection beats dull line-level momentum (−0.3). Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, the prose suffers from moderate overwriting: stacked metaphors ("shadow a fractured compass," "philosophical argument unresolved," "fates untold," "velvet-covered blade") cluster densely without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "The duel had begun, even before Lyra stepped through the atrium's doors" restates the prior sentence's point. Filter verbs ("he knew," "she mused") dull immediacy in several beats. The figurative density—nearly every paragraph contains a complex metaphor—compresses information rather than layering it, triggering the overwriting penalty for high-pressure beats without payoff. Stock phrases like "eyes sharp as needles" and "voice like the rustle of dry leaves" further reduce textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "rebuild" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure; "broken, weathered, and waiting for renewal" is restated as "broken, censored, discarded" later. Template cadence is visible in paired constructions ("Whatever authorities might destroy, they would restore. Whatever they tried to censor, they would circulate"). The opening subordinate clause string ("by day... by night...") and the final paragraph's three parallel "Somewhere" constructions create rhythmic stacking. Stock metaphors ("wildflowers through sidewalks," "seeds and contacts") appear without fresh specificity. Figurative density in the final third (luminous fracture, blooming resistance, architect of resistance) clusters without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and reads smoothly, but scaffold and paraphrase loops appear throughout: "The pianist was a strategically creative man, and he had devised a method" immediately precedes the method's description; "The clock struck midnight—again—and everything stilled" is followed by "The pianist stepped back." Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching ("notes dissolving into haze," "day bled into night," "salt and forgotten dreams") but mixed metaphors are avoided. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate rather than advance (−0.6 for loops and density drift).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; opening and closing sentences anchor voice. Information density is high in the first third, then thins during the dream sequence where symbolic gestures replace concrete pressure. Minor template cadence in the mid-section ("He saw... He let... He pushed...") and some abstract phrasing ("profound, almost desperate, need") soften propulsion. The final paragraph's "luminous doubt... tempered by a nascent certainty" and "beautiful, luminous doubt" loop the motif without advancing the image, edging toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts lower momentum. "Cerulean regret" recurs as decorative label without evolving mechanical function. Paraphrase loop: "the threads holding not just decorative knots but instructions" followed shortly by "the lace pattern…instructions for diffusing" restates without pressure gain. Template cadence: multiple "he + verb" stems and "the compass" + action structures cluster in the middle third. Stock metaphor: "tides of remembrance that threatened to drown him" is functional but unearned specificity. Figurative density (ghost ship, color of apologies, channels mirroring waterways, roots preserved in small spaces) appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching, creating minor overwriting. These issues do not obscure causality but dull propulsion. Applying patterned-artifact baseline (−0.6 to −0.8 for loops, template stems, and stock strings across the piece) and figurative density (−0.3) brings this to mid-6 range.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and strong, concrete images (the dust, cracked terracotta pot, jagged glass) doing multiple jobs at once. Sentences generally avoid redundancy and maintain momentum despite a reflective mode. There is some risk of lyrical overload (multiple metaphor-laden sentences in sequence), but the comparisons are coherent and thematically apt rather than purple for its own sake. Grammar and flow are clean, and the final line lands with clarity rather than obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and multi-purpose, often advancing mood, character, and theme in the same sentence. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with images (frost maps, soot as sorrow) reinforcing each other rather than competing. There is some density (“a sad, failing gesture of creation against destruction”) that edges toward purple but stops short of obscuring sense, and repetition is minimal. Overall momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode, with no major scaffolding or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with clean syntax, vivid images, and good momentum for a contemplative piece. There is some mild repetition and purple edging in phrases like “phantom symphony of chaos” and reiterated formulations of filling/rectifying silence, but these do not materially obscure sense or undercut the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax and generally high information density—most sentences advance both world and character. Figurative language is controlled rather than piled on, and key metaphors (frozen lightning, seafoam, chased stillness) are coherent and thematically aligned. There is minor conceptual repetition (“weary undertaker,” “permanent address,” “stillness”) but it reads as motif rather than scaffolding. Nothing at the line level obscures causality or dulls the ending; the final sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally clear, with varied sentence rhythms and an absence of obvious scaffold or synonym loops, and most lines do multiple jobs (world, theme, and character). Some phrasing is slightly repetitive conceptually (“quiet threads of trust,” “amplified quiet,” “gentle persistence”), and the density of abstract nouns in the final third (“interdependence,” “economy,” “mission fulfilled”) slightly blurs immediacy. Figurative language is measured and internally coherent; nothing purple or confusing intrudes on the closure. Overall momentum is more contemplative than propulsive, but not bogged down.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax, strong sensory verbs, and images that often do double duty (e.g., wisteria as both setting and emotional register). There is some drift toward purple/abstract phrasing and slight repetition of motifs (“unused love,” “pilgrim of sparks”) without always adding new pressure. Nonetheless, clarity is never compromised, and most sentences advance atmosphere and character together. Trimming a few explanatory or high-level thematic lines would elevate the prose into a leaner, more powerful register.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with generally clean syntax and strong, image-rich lines that pull double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Some metaphor density and repetition (“hyperbolic geometry,” “quaking reverie,” repeated “the fragment…” openings) verge on purple and could be pared for greater punch. Despite this, clarity is maintained and momentum carries through to a potent closing image. A bit more variation in sentence structure and a touch less ornamental phrasing in peak beats would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and propulsive; information density is high, and nearly every sentence advances action, mood, or stakes. At times, though, metaphors and abstractions stack (“chains clanking like funeral bells,” “symbol of endurance,” “staggering grace”) in ways that nudge toward purple and slightly dilute impact rather than sharpening it. There is minor conceptual redundancy around resilience and purpose, but no severe loops or clarity issues. The climax remains clear and vivid, even if some figurative choices could be pared back for greater precision.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: syntax varies, images are striking, and almost every sentence does at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus interiority, or theme plus action). There is some tendency toward stacked figurative language and abstraction (“a collision of histories, a symphony of what-ifs and could-have-beens”) that edges into purple and repeats conceptual ground already covered by the images. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, momentum doesn’t stall, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts. With slightly leaner phrasing in the most metaphor-heavy lines, this would push into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and a consistent musicality; most sentences do more than one job. The figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors that confuse. There is some over-ornamentation and repetition of conceptual frames (“destiny’s door,” “illuminated moments”) that could be trimmed for maximum sharpness at this level. No major loops or scaffolding artifacts disrupt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally vivid and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for image and character. There is some tendency toward stacked metaphor or slightly purple constructions ("weighty lightness," "scorpions of rust," plus the mixed-language "冰冷 prison") that risk feeling ornamental. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact; we rarely get true redundancy or confusion. A light tightening of figurative density and abstraction would push this toward top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is largely clear and rhythmic, with some effective images (“stars above glittering like scattered salt”) and a consistent atmospheric texture. It also leans toward purple and repetitive (“trembling certainty,” multiple re-statements of the same emotional or thematic beat), which slightly dulls momentum. Several long, similarly structured sentences create a drumbeat feel rather than purposeful modulation. Nonetheless, syntax remains coherent and causality readable; line-level issues do not seriously obscure the story’s through-line or ending.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally elegant and rhythmic, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs of atmosphere, worldbuilding, and interiority. Repetition of key phrases feels mostly intentional and motif-driven rather than redundant looping. At times the language flirts with purple (“bruised violet sky,” “marbled hush within him”), and abstractions like “architecture of silence” cluster, but they don’t obscure sense. Trimming a few near-synonymous intensifiers would sharpen momentum and elevate the line work further.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is generally clean and rhythmic, with some striking images (“twilight bled violet,” droplets “sizzling like tiny stars”) that support mood without overwhelming sense. There are a few tendencies toward familiar SF-poetic phrasing and mild repetition of concepts (loops, timelines, second chance program), but not enough to bog momentum or obscure causality. Sentences carry multiple functions—worldbuilding, mood, and plot—keeping information density high. The prose falls short of truly exceptional partly because it leans on a recognizable lyrical register rather than a fully singular stylistic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with some strong images (“crystal whispering stones humming faintly where the rain had pooled”). There are a few familiar or heavy-handed phrases (“weight of a thousand unsaid truths,” “freed by honesty,” “ambiguously clear”) and mild repetition of concepts (words unnecessary, quiet not empty) that soften impact. The prose occasionally explains what the image already shows, diluting density, but it doesn’t significantly obscure action or closure. Overall it’s competent, gently lyrical, and publishable with tightening rather than radically distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is fluent and largely free of scaffolding, with good sentence variety and a solid balance between description and movement. Key images—the cracked marbles, the green glow, the map-shaped vine—are clean and memorable without devolving into purple flourish. There is some mild redundancy and abstract phrasing (“embodied this same philosophy,” “mended deception at the heart”) that could be tightened for maximal density. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only light edits.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level writing is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with some evocative images (“captured auroras,” “icy warmth of discovery”). There is mild repetition and a hint of purple—phrases like “mechanically warm” and “hush of beating wings at rest” recur without always deepening meaning, and the diction occasionally leans ornamental. Still, information density is decent and the sentences generally pull their weight without obvious scaffolding or loops. The prose supports the scene competently rather than elevating it into something unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically sound, and capable of strong images (“flickering lanterns cast dancing shadows on the water’s surface”). There is some redundancy in phrasing (especially around “water damage creating images”) and a tendency toward long, slightly overstuffed sentences that could be tightened for impact. Occasional minor errors and expository restatements sap momentum. Line-level craft is competent but not yet at a refined, high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and purposeful figurative language that often does double duty for setting and theme. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few phrases skirt purple or slightly overloaded metaphor (“auroral sorrow,” “airless voids of emotion that defied prediction”), but they don’t obscure sense or closure. The final paragraphs remain clear and charged, though a touch more restraint in abstraction could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, dense but purposeful imagery, and few wasted lines, with the prose doing double duty for setting and interiority. Some metaphors press close to purple (“smelling of ozone and regret,” “tears frozen in time”) yet remain coherent rather than mixed, though the repetition of “swallowed truth” and abstract phrasing occasionally feels heavy-handed. Typos/odd artifacts (“world感的,” “swallowe d”) and a couple of overstuffed sentences detract from the elite-level finish expected in a top market. Momentum overall is maintained, but a touch more pruning and precision would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is imaginative and often striking, with high information density and few outright clunkers, but it edges into purple: nearly every sentence bears a metaphor or abstraction, which can blur impact. The stray numerical artifacts (“127]”, “223]”, “238]”, etc.) are jarring and break immersion, reading as visible scaffolding rather than intentional devices. Some conceptual redundancy (multiple formulations of decay/regeneration) slightly drags momentum. Overall, the line craft is above average but would need tightening and cleanup to meet top-tier standards.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished, with controlled imagery and few redundancies; phrases like “dreaming roots” and “ordinary magic” recur as deliberate motifs rather than aimless repetition. Most sentences do more than one job—advancing scene, revealing character, and maintaining atmosphere. There is a mild tendency toward abstraction and summary in places (“represented pure potential,” “lifelong wonder”), and the closing thematic exposition could be tightened. Still, there are no major loops or figurative muddles, and momentum is preserved throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally precise and textured, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme). Phrases like “bronze quiet” and “threads in my fingers…visitors between the loom and the air” are striking without slipping into muddled or mixed metaphor. There is occasional density in modifiers and abstract nouns, but it rarely clogs clarity or momentum within this reflective frame. I see no notable redundancy loops or scaffolding sentences; line-level craft meets high literary standards, just shy of the most exceptional polish.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally well-paced, with some strong images and efficient sentences. There is some reliance on familiar metaphor (“composer of life’s hidden scores,” “ghost in the machine,” “confetti in the wind”) and light redundancy around “directing the flow” and “transposition.” Still, line-level clutter is limited; most sentences carry narrative or atmospheric weight. Rhythm could vary more, but nothing majorly obscures clarity or dulls the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally elegant, with high information density and vivid, controlled imagery that suits the concept. There is some redundancy and scaffold (“The priest’s motivation was clear...”; reiterations of his purpose and method) that could be pared without loss, and figurative language is frequent enough to flirt with purple in places. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to maintain momentum, and clarity is never seriously compromised. Line-level craft is strong but not razor-tight enough for elite-tier minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is strong: few wasted sentences, good information density, and figurative language that mostly clarifies rather than muddies (“upturned hush,” “bruised purple” sky, “chronological homesickness” as a character-specific coinage). There’s some repetition of certain constructions and motifs but they read as intentional patterning rather than artifact. A handful of phrases drift toward purple or slightly redundant (“relentless, chronological homesickness he couldn't escape” is conceptually doubled), though they don’t interfere with clarity or closure. Overall momentum and readability remain high despite the lyric tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean and readable, with some striking images and controlled syntax, and it sustains momentum through most of the piece. There is mild purple layering and repetition—variants of “glow,” “darkness/brightness,” “labyrinth of self,” and “fractured timelines” recur without always adding new information—leading to occasional sense of sameness rather than intensification. Still, there are no serious clarity failures or mixed metaphors, and the final paragraph lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with vivid images and mostly efficient sentences that advance both mood and character. However, figurative density is high—metaphors and abstractions stack (“filament of hush,” “reverse imprint,” “emotional quagmire,” “tapestry of scrapes”) and edge toward purple, sometimes saying similar things twice. Clarity survives, but a leaner pass could heighten impact by trimming redundancy. Minor multilingual insertions (“混乱”, “终于”) feel slightly ornamental rather than structurally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with effective sensory details. There is some redundancy and mild purple-prose tendency (“storms, both literal and metaphorical,” repeated integrity/solitude framing) that could be trimmed for greater impact. Figurative language is mostly coherent and anchored, and momentum carries through without major stalls. No serious artifacts or loops obscure cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, mostly concise, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery around light, scent, and glass is rich and largely coherent, and key beats remain clear despite the lyric density. There is some tendency toward purple stacking and abstraction (“the chemistry of sorrow,” “complex architecture of his own sorrow”), and occasional repetition of modifiers and constructions that could be lightly pared without loss. Still, there are no major loops or muddled metaphors, and line-level craft supports rather than obscures the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and cadence, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and on-theme; metaphors cluster around texture, geometry, light, and weaving, maintaining internal logic. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every paragraph contains a striking image—but it rarely drags momentum or obscures action. No evident loops, scaffold sentences, or mechanical cadences interfere with clarity, especially in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences do atmospheric, thematic, and character work simultaneously. Imagery is often striking (“chronic hush that settled like ash,” shipwrecks as “broken elders,” the bowl trembling with “unfinished things”) and the final paragraph lands cleanly. There is a tendency toward lushness and stacked metaphors throughout, which edges close to purple and risks diminishing impact through saturation. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and there are no noticeable loops or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and generally high information density—most sentences do double duty for mood and character. Occasional repetition (“amber grotto at dusk,” “as the transformation completed”) and stacked abstractions approach purple but do not obscure clarity or momentum. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and grammar/punctuation are clean. A slight trim of repeated formulations would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and fluid, with only mild tendencies toward purple (“hung in the air like sea fog on the pier”) that don’t seriously impede clarity. Sentences usually do more than one job—advancing action while reinforcing theme or setting—and there’s little outright redundancy. Some metaphor choices feel familiar and a bit overworked, and a few summary sentences could be tightened or cut to sharpen momentum. Overall, line-level craft is solid but not yet at the startling, high-compression level expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose delivers many striking images and maintains a consistent rhythm, and most sentences carry both atmosphere and story work. There is some repetition and slight purple-leaning (“beyond the murmur of lost languages,” “webs of kinship,” “luminescence aching”) and a tendency in the final third to rephrase the same emotional beat about belonging. Still, clarity remains high, scaffolding is minimal, and figurative language rarely muddies sense. Tightening a few redundant lines would move this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally sharp and high-density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) and a good read-aloud rhythm. Some phrases veer toward purple or abstract (“the first and last echo of everything,” “a fragile thread of causality”) and a few metaphoric clusters could be pared for maximal impact, but clarity remains intact. Momentum is maintained despite long sentences, in part because transitions are causal and concrete. There are no serious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic artifacts that would disqualify it from a strong market.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and generally economical: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or action plus theme). Imagery around light, dripping water, and patterned stone is vivid without devolving into incoherent metaphor, and syntax remains clear. There is some conceptual repetition (“mathematics of emotion,” gentle inventiveness, buried optimism) and a few lines that tell the theme rather than letting it emerge, but these do not significantly obscure momentum or closure. Overall, craft is strong and controlled, if slightly inclined toward the didactic in reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm, clear syntax, and generally high information density, weaving setting, character, and theme efficiently. Metaphors like the building’s beams as “aged bones” and the tape’s “metallic smell” are apt and concrete. There is some mild repetition around Elias’s methods and motivations, and occasional phrases (“quiet transmission of stories,” “becoming visible to those who need you”) veer toward abstraction. Still, no significant loops or muddled images impede momentum, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology. There is some density of figurative language and a few slightly ornate turns (“the sky bruised purple and wept for days”), but they cohere into a consistent stylistic pattern rather than clutter. Redundancy is minimal and action remains clear even in more poetic passages. A touch more pruning of abstract phrases in the closing paragraph could sharpen impact, but line-level craft is strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are generally clear, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Phrases like “haggard awe” and “the memory of water’s journey” are vivid without tipping into muddled metaphor, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. A few abstractions and repeated formulations around “experience” and “meaning” edge toward conceptual repetition, but they don’t significantly stall momentum or blur sense. Overall, the prose would need only light tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, mostly clear, and rhythmically varied, with several striking images and minimal outright errors (aside from a small typo: “vidence”). There is some tendency toward abstraction and stacked conceptual phrases (“cosmic grammar of cause and effect, potentiality and actuality”) that risk blurring immediacy. A few insights are repeated or over-explained instead of letting prior sentences carry the weight. Tightening redundancy and grounding some of the loftier lines in concrete sensation would markedly elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally precise and rhythmically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Imagery around the harbor, the valve, and the archives is vivid without sliding into florid excess. There are a few abstract or slightly academic phrases that momentarily distance (“mechanics of dispersal”), but they do not materially harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally fluent and rhythmic, with some strong images (cracks widening into maps, mirrors cracking as he passes). Yet it trends toward overwriting and repetition: “dared” recurs as a motif without much variation, “analytically artistic” is repeated as a label, and several metaphors pile up in quick succession (mist as shroud, arrows as lantern, spires as needles of judgment). Some sentences restate similar ideas about mystery, certainty, and new starts, adding ornament more than new information. The line-level craft is solid but would benefit from tightening and pruning redundant figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose has several strong images and a smooth general rhythm, but it carries noticeable artifacts: repetition of concepts and phrases (“As she descended the stairs…” appears twice; “space for reflection,” “unheard symphony,” “entangled memories” recur without always adding pressure), minor typos, and an out-of-world comment about word count. Some sentences paraphrase the same idea in adjacent lines, creating a sense of paraphrase looping and softening momentum. While not truly purple, the line-level work feels slightly over-decorated and under-edited for elite publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level work is generally strong, with high information density and many images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Rhythm varies and most sentences carry clear sense despite the abstract subject matter. That said, the prose sometimes tips into purple and repetitive metaphor (“hushed thunder” and variations; multiple jewel/facet/folding images), and a few phrases explain what the image already shows, softening impact. These tendencies slightly drag momentum and reduce the sharpness of the otherwise striking closure imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-by-line, the prose is controlled and clear, with good information density and minimal redundancy; sentences tend to do more than one job (world, mood, character). Imagery like “deathly vitality” and the ink that liquefies rigid thinking is strong without tipping into purple. There are a few abstract or slightly over-articulated phrases, but they don’t seriously slow momentum or obscure action. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the piece readable and propulsive at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, and there are few if any genuine artifacts or confusions. The prose occasionally drifts toward purple or redundant emphasis (“incandescent restraint,” repeated formulations of “invented histories”), but not to the point of obscuring sense. Most lines do real work, though some summary-like restatements in the final third mildly flatten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with dense, multi-tasking sentences and few wasted lines; images like the brittle, salt-softened label are sharp. Some metaphors and phrases (“ghost among giants,” “graveyard of voices,” “cartographer of the forgotten”) cluster toward the purple and echo one another conceptually. This produces a mild sense of sameness and over-insistence rather than fresh progression. Clarity remains high throughout, but a leaner, more varied texture would better match elite-line expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences read smoothly and are mostly well-structured, with clear progression and no major grammatical noise. There are occasional redundancies and slightly purple or generalized passages, especially in the final moralizing lines, that could be tightened for impact. Figurative language is present but not overwhelmingly stacked; however, some abstractions (“cheerful pursuit of possibility,” “music of questions”) feel like slogans rather than concrete images. The prose is solid and publishable with revision, but not at an elite, line-perfect level.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with strong image choice (“floating monoliths of glass and steel,” “silver veins of possibility”) and generally efficient sentences that carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and character). Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; metaphors are coherent and on-theme, avoiding mixed or confusing images. There is some mild abstract phrasing and conceptual repetition around privatization and preservation, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum at this length. Line-level craft is comfortably at a near-publishable standard, though not yet so taut or surprising as to feel elite-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and well-paced, with good information density—most sentences carry both worldbuilding and emotional or thematic weight. There are a few mild redundancies (e.g., reiterating the uniqueness of the moment and his need to “outlast”) and some slightly stock formulations (“burned bright”, “deeply personal”), but they don’t seriously impede momentum. Figurative language is modest and mostly apt, avoiding purple excess or mixed metaphors. Line-level craft is strong enough for solid publication, though not quite at the razor-edged precision of elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with smooth cadence and no major grammatical or syntactic issues. There is solid information density, and many sentences do double duty for mood and action. However, there is evident repetition and scaffold (“the mist outside… but inside…”; “the calm in his chest…”; reiterations of horns, hums, and mist) that could be pared, and some lines veer into mild purple/sentimental redundancy near the end. Line-level craft is competent but not razor-honed for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly lean, clear, and doing double duty for mood and information. Imagery is often strong (“maps scattered like fallen leaves,” “clicks echoed like tiny heralds of revelation”) and supports the central conceits. That said, metaphor density occasionally edges toward overstatement and some phrases feel slightly redundant or on-the-nose (e.g., explicitly labeling the condensation’s lesson about knowledge). The prose is certainly publication-ready with light tightening, but not yet in the rarefied, razor-precise range.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clean, imagistic, and purposeful, with few true redundancies. The metaphorics around sound, light, and time are coherent and not excessively stacked, though phrases like “infinitely patient” and similar constructions do recur. Rhythm on the page mirrors the rhythmic subject matter without devolving into obvious template-cadence or cluttered ornament. The final line’s cadence (“in the wild hush of dawn…a new town was born”) lands musically and caps the motif set.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often evocative (“water defies physics, flowing in crystalline spirals”), with good rhythm and no major clarity breaks. At the same time, there is a noticeable reliance on abstract nouns and repeated syntactic patterns, plus occasional paraphrase-like reinforcement of the same idea (time pressure, overriding instinct) without added pressure. The line-level work is solid but not particularly cut to the bone or surprising, which limits momentum and sensory sharpness at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is largely clean, syntactically varied, and dense with meaning; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Some metaphors and modifiers verge on purple (“copper sunset… melancholic repose,” “scent of salt and regret”), but they are coherent and pattern-consistent rather than muddled. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and action remains clear even when the language becomes more lyrical. The main limitation at this level is that figurative density is relatively high throughout, so moments of sharper, plainer prose could better highlight the peak turns.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is lush and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion. However, figurative density is high—shimmering, glowing, humming, endless night, multiple metaphors per paragraph—risking saturation and mild redundancy. A few phrases (“lovingly venomous,” “mournfully elated”) feel repeated conceptually rather than deepened, and some beats restate the same emotional content in slightly different language. Clarity and momentum remain intact, but trimming a few ornamental lines would improve precision and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding (“canyon walls that glowed like internal organs in the predawn light” is both specific and unsettling). Information density is high without major scaffold or loop artifacts, and rhythm varies well across the piece. However, metaphor and abstraction are stacked heavily—“impossible,” “hauntingly optimistic,” “residual magic”—to the point that a few lines verge on purple and slightly blunt impact. Line-level work is strong but could benefit from a touch more restraint and contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, mostly concise, and sustains momentum through a contemplative scene with strong information density per sentence. Descriptive language is rich but usually purposeful, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. There are some near-paraphrase lines and mildly purple or thesis-like sentences in the final third that could be tightened (“She would rebuild her story upon this foundation…”), but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or closure. Overall line-level craft is strong, if not yet razor-honed for maximal compression.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, grammatical, and sensorially rich, with no real confusion in syntax or reference. However, the prose is overwritten in places, stacking similar metaphors and abstract phrasing that reiterate the same idea (liminal spaces, margins, ghosts, echoes) without adding new information. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase each other conceptually, reducing momentum and making the middle feel padded. Tightening repetitions and cutting a few high-level abstractions would materially sharpen the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is lush and image-rich, but it frequently lapses into paraphrase loops and purple repetition (e.g., multiple near-identical mentions of conspiracies unraveling, echoed silence, synchronizing stitches/flame). Information density suffers as successive sentences restate the same stakes and mood rather than advancing them. Occasional errors (“coupevery”) and formulaic turns of phrase undercut polish. Line-level craft is promising but overwrought and in need of ruthless compression.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and well-paced, with vivid metaphors and a clear sense of rhythm, and most sentences do more than one job. However, there’s a tendency toward stacked modifiers and slightly purple formulations (“a prison of possibilities,” “fierce tenderness flooding the space”) that sometimes restate the emotional state already clear from context. A few near-redundant explanations—reiterating the shard’s purpose or the spirits’ encouragement—could be tightened without loss. Despite that, clarity remains high and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally high: imagery is vivid, syntax mostly clear, and many sentences carry multiple layers of work. However, the density of figurative language (“funeral shrouds,” “twilight’s tears,” “lotus-hearted ache,” etc.) borders on purple and occasionally blurs rather than sharpens emotional force. There is some conceptual redundancy around the coral fragment and ache being reframed. Trimming a few metaphors and tightening repetition would significantly improve momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and layered metaphors that mostly cohere. However, figurative density is high—“pensive mirth,” “tiny ghosts,” “tapestry of simple joys,” “conversation with the past”—which risks slight purple-prose drag in a short piece. Information density is good, but a few lines restate the same emotional state in different imagery. Line-level craft is above average and readable, but tightening and pruning metaphors would be needed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level work is generally strong, with vivid images and varied syntax; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is a tendency toward saturation—figurative language appears in most lines of the garden sequence—which edges into mild purple prose and occasional redundancy around “awakening,” “hum,” and “wonder.” Despite the density, cause-and-effect remains clear and rhythm doesn’t significantly bog down. Tighter pruning of repeated conceptual phrasing, especially in the closing paragraph, would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level work is polished: varied syntax, purposeful imagery (“moth wings…like fragmented thoughts”), and mostly efficient sentences that carry setting, mood, and character simultaneously. Occasional familiar metaphors (“fireflies in a jar”) and a mild density of figurative language don’t clog momentum or blur sense, so the prose feels controlled rather than purple.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme; phrases like “nebulae trapped in paper” and “reef-shadow dawn” are striking. At times, density edges toward overwriting—similar metaphoric moves repeat (pain into beauty, galaxies swirling, ghosts of tides)—and a couple of sentences restate information with minimal new pressure. Still, clarity remains strong and momentum is adequate for a lyric piece; the closing image is clean and not muddled by figurative excess. Tightening a few redundant formulations would further elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose shows strong line-level craft: few if any grammatical slips, vivid imagery, and many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. However, metaphor and adjective density is high (“spun from crystalline dew,” “poison-sweet,” “threading through the air like spun sugar,” etc.), creating a mild purple-prose sheen and some redundancy in emotional registers. A few concepts are restated in similar language (foxglove regret, deserted marvels, the ongoing burden) without adding new facets, which slightly drags momentum. Tightening and varying texture—especially at peak beats—would lift this to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally fluent and rhythmically pleasant, with effective sensory detail and a clear progression of images. However, there is noticeable redundancy in both content and phrasing: the symphonies, paths diverging, promises, and the ink well’s significance are reiterated in similar terms. Several sentences could be tightened without loss, and figurative language edges toward purple in places, diluting impact. Line-level craft is solid but not ruthlessly economical or surprising enough for immediate top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and most lines do double duty with image and interiority. Some metaphoric density verges on purple—repeated “breathing” of the building/volcano, “dappled resolve,” “encrypted compassion” recycled as phrasing—and creates a sense of insistence. There are mild paraphrase tendencies where similar ideas about balance and compassion are restated rather than advanced. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and no figurative muddle seriously harms the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rich and image-dense but mostly avoids muddle; metaphors—dust as “wildfire flowers,” motes as “withering stars”—are coherent and in-register with the piece’s cosmological grief. Sentences generally do multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops, and the final cadence is clean and resonant. The line-level can flirt with purple, and one visible glitch (“解释backdrop”) plus the near-constant figurative pressure introduce light drag rather than pure propulsion. Still, clarity and momentum survive, especially around the central operation and release beats.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose showcases strong imagistic instincts—prism light, warped thresholds, butterfly wings—creating a memorable texture. Yet it frequently paraphrases its own insights and stacks similar metaphors (“fractured light,” “fractured hush,” “impossible geometries”) in ways that feel redundant. Explanatory lines reiterating the theme (“Transportation requires navigable spaces… yet some distances must remain unbridged”) slow momentum and edge toward purple or didactic. Sentence-level clarity stays intact, but tighter pruning of repeated concepts and ornamental phrasing would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally fluid and grammatically clean, with strong sensory and conceptual density, particularly in the description of the observatory awakening and the bioluminescent display. There is some tendency toward purple or overpacked phrasing (“shadowseam wonder,” “softly ingenious system”) and thematic repetition near the end, but it doesn’t seriously obscure meaning. Sentences mostly carry more than one function (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus image), supporting momentum in a quiet way. A modest tightening—especially of explicit abstractions around belonging—would lift the line-level work noticeably.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean: sentences are grammatical, causality is clear, and there’s reasonable syntactic variety. Some redundancy and mild purple tendencies crop up (“cheerful gloom” repeated, multiple color/light metaphors, reiterating her quest and stakes), but they don’t significantly obscure meaning or momentum. The figurative language is mostly coherent and in-register, doing real atmospheric work. Trimming a few explanatory or repetitious phrases would tighten the prose to a more competitive literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied sentence rhythms, purposeful imagery, and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Some metaphors are familiar or slightly purple (“eyes like shattered glass,” “murmur of stars”), but they don’t impede clarity or momentum. Most sentences do double duty, advancing action while reinforcing tone. Minor over-ornamentation in places keeps it just shy of elite literary tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“each letter burned with obsidian grace—sharp, elegant, absolute…”). Some repetition of key terms (“gaps,” “nostalgia,” “memory suppression”) and a few near-ornamental modifiers flirt with purple but do not seriously obscure meaning. There is one clear artifact/typo and occasional conceptual heaviness where an image could carry what an abstract phrase explains. Overall momentum survives, but a light trim of abstractions and redundancy would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often strong at the line level, with images that do multiple jobs—setting, mood, and character interiority—carried in single sentences. That said, there is evident repetition of ideas and wording (the mist/prism phrasing, the refrain-like “before everything shifts”), which creates a sense of paraphrase looping rather than escalation. A few minor mechanical slips (“thepond,” “panewould,” “toerglass”) and occasional purple phrasing nudge against clarity and elite-level finish. Overall momentum survives, but the piece would benefit from tightening and pruning redundant articulations.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and images like “ink spilled across parchment” and the “celestial slow dance” create a pleasing texture. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant abstraction, especially in the final paragraph’s triad (“compassion born from fire, resilience born from loss, hope born from the courage…”), which tells what earlier images already imply. A few therapy- and craft-workshop phrases (“reframing his relationship,” “translating pain into a language”) slightly blunt immediacy. Nonetheless, momentum and clarity are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and mostly clear, with good rhythmic variation and integrated imagery (the gauge, ripples, light) doing multiple jobs at once. However, it flirts with purple: abstractions (“serene upheaval,” “equations for hope,” “energy guide her”) and repeated conceptual phrasing accumulate, at times dulling immediacy and momentum. There are minor paraphrase-like repetitions of ideas about patterns, hope, and parallel timelines that could be tightened. Despite this, line-level control remains solid and never obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: many sentences carry dual loads of atmosphere and character, and images like “brittle leaves that clung to the stone like stubborn secrets” are vivid. There is some mild over-writing and redundancy, particularly in the closing reflection where concepts (“legacy’s burden,” “chosen”) are reiterated rather than newly embodied. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and momentum generally holds; few sentences feel like scaffolding. The final moralizing turn slightly blunts the otherwise sharp closing image work.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with vivid metaphors (e.g., “dusky harmony between notes, between heartbeats, between seeing and believing”) and clear, flowing sentences. Information density is good; most lines carry setting, concept, and mood simultaneously. However, repeated constructions and exact phrases (“the hush before bells ring,” “the prism parapet after rain”) verge on paraphrase loops rather than deliberate incantation. A modest trim of redundancies and a bit more variation in key formulations would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and mostly clear, and the piece maintains a steady, readable rhythm. There is, however, noticeable redundancy and abstract phrasing—motifs like “slow dance of celestial bodies,” “anchor ideals in practice,” and “flawed beauty” recur with minimal new pressure or image. Figurative language sometimes trends toward purple or generalized insight rather than concrete, fresh embodiment, slightly flattening momentum. The prose is solid but could be tightened and sharpened to avoid looped phrasing and thematic restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“rain… in arrhythmic patterns that almost resembled applause”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum, and information density is high without major confusion. There is some purple-leaning accumulation of modifiers and metaphors (“warm as forgotten sunlight,” “fractured grace,” multiple “extinct”/“echo” invocations) that occasionally feels ornamental rather than pressure-bearing. Nonetheless, clarity survives throughout, and no line-level artifact undermines the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences flow, images are mostly clear, and many lines do double duty for atmosphere and psychology. However, the prose veers into mild purple and repetition (“she was…” constructions; reasserting her paradox and wholeness), especially in the final third, where the thematic summary could be tightened. This softens momentum and slightly dulls the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often elegant, with strong sensory and conceptual density per line. Figurative language generally lands, and there’s little in the way of obvious scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony. Some metaphors verge on purple or feel slightly over-determined (“meteor hush,” “velvet curtain”), and the frequency of high-register images risks softening momentum. Still, clarity and propulsion remain intact, and line-level craft would require only light tightening for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images, controlled syntax, and few if any grammatical or clarity issues; most sentences do more than one job. There is some repetition and near-paraphrase (“blushing stillness” recurs; several sentences restate his transience and honoring of histories) that could be trimmed for greater concision and impact. At times the figurative density edges toward purple, but the metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than muddled. Overall, line-level craft is above average and publication-ready with modest tightening of redundant phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and dense, with many sentences multitasking to carry image, atmosphere, and emotion; rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain flow. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, nudging the piece toward purple in places and occasionally obscuring sharpness (“snowmelt ardor” is striking yet slightly opaque; repetition of “technically gentle” reads like a visible seam). There is some conceptual redundancy around his guilt and its dissolution that could be tightened. Line-level craft is strong but not fully pared down to the most essential, high-impact moves.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do double duty for mood and story. Metaphors (“crystallized code,” “synthetic dirge”) are controlled and thematically apt rather than ornamental, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The prose maintains momentum even while being lyrical, without sliding into purple or obscuring causality. A slight tendency toward abstract diction in the dreamscape keeps it just shy of top-tier sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line by line, the prose is confident, often striking, and generally clear; many sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) efficiently. That said, figurative language is dense, with frequent metaphorical stacking (“dusky harmony,” “jagged crown,” “veil drawn aside”) that occasionally approaches purple and risks blurring emphasis. Some conceptual repetition (“encrypted devotion,” “empirically ironic”) slightly flattens momentum in the closing stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean and largely clear, with some pleasing images (walls “flickered between stone and mist”; “her very cells exhaling”). There is noticeable repetition of key phrases and ideas (the box reappearing, the broken pin as reminder, “cellular memory”) that at times feels more like thematic hammering than deliberate patterning. A few lines slide into therapy-jargon abstraction over concrete embodiment. Still, sentences generally carry multiple functions (world, theme, character) and maintain momentum without heavy scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and mostly purposeful figurative language (“like clouds meeting,” “quantum alchemy” as intuitive shorthand). Sentences vary in length and structure, and description generally advances atmosphere, world, and theme simultaneously. There is some risk of metaphor accumulation in the middle, but clarity and momentum are not materially harmed. The opening and closing images are especially well-cut, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing dual work for setting and emotion (“fruit that smelled faintly of regret,” “fingers stained with dirt and hope”). Description is often striking without becoming incoherent or overly purple. There is some redundancy and mild over-explanation (“She wasn’t just planting a seed; she was planting a bridge,” recapping what the images already show), which slightly blunts momentum and subtlety. Still, no significant artifacts obscure cause/effect or mar the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with a few genuinely vivid images. Still, there is noticeable redundancy in both diction and concept—ideas about nonlinear inheritance and “between the first and last page” are reiterated without always adding new pressure or nuance. Some sentences slide toward pseudo-profound abstraction instead of grounding revelations in specific sensory or emotional shifts. Rhythm is serviceable but not especially dynamic, and trimming repeated formulations would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly tight, doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned—silence, symphony, grammar/lexicon—and rarely feels mixed or overwrought. Information flow supports momentum; even expository lines such as “Her method became one of meticulous scholarship” pivot quickly into concrete action. There is a mild risk of purple density in places, but it does not obscure causality or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally clear, and many lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus mood plus plot). However, there is noticeable repetition of key abstractions and constructions (“unkindled solace,” “trapped freedom,” “blissfully aberrant,” “through narrative threads”), which creates a faint sense of synonym-loop and conceptual redundancy. Figurative language is mostly coherent but occasionally piles up without adding new precision, drifting toward purple in places. The line-level craft is solid and publishable with tightening, but not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm varies well, and the line-level clarity remains intact even amid rich imagery. However, figurative language is heavily loaded in many consecutive sentences, occasionally approaching purple and risking saturation rather than escalation. Trimming a few metaphorical flourishes would likely sharpen impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear and smooth, with a solid auditory texture (hum, thrum, howl) that suits the premise. However, there are noticeable paraphrase loops and repeated phrases (“gently luminous stone,” “bloom of hush,” similar sentence cadences) that could be cut or varied for more punch. Some lines verge on purple or generic (“world gone mad,” “storm outside the cave raged on”) without adding new information or pressure. Line-level craft is solid but not razor-honed; tightening would appreciably raise momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: imagery like “shard of hush” and “tears frozen in time” is striking, and most sentences do multiple jobs. There is some mild purple density and repetition of conceptual phrases (e.g., “retrocognitive blessing/blessed mind”), but no real loops or muddled metaphors that obscure sense. Pacing remains steady, perhaps too even, yet clarity never slips. A light tightening pass to trim redundancies and a few abstractions would put this prose into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose offers rich images and generally good sentence-level control, and it maintains clarity even in more metaphorically dense passages. There is some purple drift and redundancy—especially around “preemptively nostalgic” and grand abstractions about memory and identity—that could be cut for concision and impact. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it occasionally feels layered for effect more than for precision. Tightening repetition and trimming a few over-lush lines would bring it closer to top-tier literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level writing is largely clear and fluent, with varied syntax and generally efficient sentences that carry atmosphere and action together. There is some tendency toward purple abstraction and repeat formulations around light/dark and hopelessness, but not to the point of obscuring meaning or momentum. Key beats (lighting and spinning the knot, mosaics shifting) are described with sufficient precision and without scaffolding clutter. The prose is polished enough for solid publication but lacks the compression and surprising precision of truly top-tier craft.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythmic variation and dense yet mostly efficient metaphor (“water pooled like liquid thought,” “words had settled between them like a sudden incoming tide”). Occasional repetition of key phrases (“texture of time”) and stacks of figurative language edge toward purple but rarely obscure sense. Most sentences multitask—advancing setting, character, and theme simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or loops. Line-level craft is comfortably at or near publishable standard, if a touch over-ornate for some tastes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with high information density and multisensory images that pull double-duty for mood and worldbuilding. However, metaphor density is very high, sometimes tipping toward purple and redundancy (multiple elaborate formulations for types of silence, reiterations of the doll’s contradictory nature). A few constructions are conceptually fuzzy (“intangibly tangible presence”) and could be pruned for sharper impact. Despite this, clarity and forward motion mostly hold, and the final image is cleanly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose features some strong images (“crystalline structures refracting the last light into fractals,” “a symphony of silence”) and is largely grammatically clean. Yet the line-level writing suffers from paraphrase loops and rote reiteration in the final third (“The terraces drifted on… The vial was still… The silence was kind”), which dampens momentum and impact. A few word choices (“fluidly logical,” repeated three times) read as prompt residue rather than natural language. Overall it’s competent, occasionally pretty, but padded and somewhat over-insistent.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a steady rhythm and clear sequencing. Some lines do double duty by combining worldbuilding with emotional charge, but there is also a noticeable reliance on familiar constructions and stock formulations (“as [X] began,” “a journey punishable by exile,” “so rare that most citizens believed it was merely legend”). The prose leans occasionally toward purple without crossing into muddle, and a few paraphrastic moments summarize rather than dramatize key tensions. Information density is decent, but trimming clichés and tightening late-stage exposition would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly dense with information and mood, and figurative language is striking and coherent (“burned bridges…with the quiet precision of a surgeon removing necrotic tissue”). There is little redundant scaffolding or synonym churn; each paragraph advances either situation or interior stakes. The lyrical density occasionally verges on purple but does not topple into muddle, and clarity of cause/effect remains intact. Variation in sentence length and paragraphing supports momentum toward the final knock.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean, readable, and rhythmically varied, with a good balance of description and action. There is some mild purple and redundancy (reiterating the pressure→diamonds idea and “weight of his past” in familiar terms), but nothing that seriously obscures clarity. Metaphoric language mostly holds together, though it clusters enough to feel slightly ornamental at times rather than always doing double-duty. Line-level craft is solid mid-tier but doesn’t yet show the ruthless compression and freshness expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft shows strong control: sentences are mostly clear, cadence varies, and images tend to be coherent and evocative (“waves cresting and breaking like a tide against the shore of his consciousness”). There is some density of metaphor and repeated constructions (“the first yawn of evening,” “bridge of intuition,” “golden shadows”) that skirts purple but doesn’t quite tip into muddle. A few lines veer into abstract summary (“the weight of his purpose settle in his chest”) rather than doing double duty with fresh image and action. Overall, the prose is polished and publishable with minor tightening for specificity and redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is often sonorous and imagistic, with some lines doing good double duty for mood and world-building (e.g., fruits “impossible hues shifting like liquid thoughts”). At the same time, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrasing (“shape of possibility,” “murmured allegiance,” “shivering bliss”), and several sentences re-explain his purpose or transformation in slightly different words. Figurative language edges into purple in places and occasionally uses odd constructions (“factually mystical,” “unsnap”) that distract. Momentum survives, but tighter cuts and more varied image-strategies would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images (“its cover stiff with age,” “dust patterns wrote their own stories”) and a generally good balance between description and movement; most sentences carry more than one job. Rhythm varies naturally and there are few, if any, true scaffolding lines or loops. The main drag is a mild tendency toward adjectival and conceptual stacking in peak beats (“small, profound current of human connection,” “small, sacred victory,” “hidden architecture of hope”), which softens precision and edges into purple. Even so, clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatical, and free of major artifacts; sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and action) without collapsing under their weight. Some phrasing trends toward generic or slightly purple (“slow poison of altered records,” “coded messages of freedom”), and there are mild redundancies in thematic phrasing. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. It’s publishable-level craft for many markets, though still a notch below the density and edge expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly lean, varied in length, and pull multiple weights (setting, mood, character) without scaffolding or obvious loops. Figurative language—“tiny prisms,” “vested hush,” “nested puzzle”—is controlled and thematically aligned, with no mixed metaphors that undercut clarity. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant grammatical or sequencing issues, allowing the prose to flow smoothly. A few adjective clusters edge toward density, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Occasional purple or redundant turns—especially the repeated folklore phrase and some summary-like exposition in the final third—soften momentum and subtlety. Nonetheless, clarity is rarely compromised, and the final image of the room as “a monument to all that would never be forgotten again” lands cleanly. Tighter pruning of repeated formulations and a bit more restraint in explaining would elevate this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely tight, image-rich, and purposeful—lines like “gears and springs tangled like tiny skeletons” and the “clock designed to stop when coincidence became pattern” do multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing support momentum, and there is little in the way of scaffolding, redundancy, or mixed metaphor. Some thematic statements and adverbial abstractions could be trimmed for higher density, and a few late sentences drift toward summary. Nonetheless, line-level craft is strong enough for near-publishable quality in many venues.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong, with few wasted lines; images often carry double duty for mood and character (“a thermos that brewed courage, a compass that pointed to unresolved grief”). The prose leans purple in places with dense metaphor stacking (“sulfur and sorrow,” “each word a shard of broken intention,” “factually mystical”), risking saturation and minor redundancy. Nonetheless, clarity remains intact, and the closure image of the scarred coin and rain is clean and memorable. A bit more pruning of conceptual adjectives and mixed-metaphor density would elevate it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with high information density and vivid metaphors that usually land cleanly. Some images and phrases recur with near-duplication (“distorted notes of a misaligned harp,” “hush of a hidden sunrise,” similar ache/laughter formulations), creating a mild sense of looped texture rather than fresh progression. Despite the lushness, clarity remains intact and the cadence supports the contemplative mode. Trimming a few redundancies and varying figurative choices would lift this toward a publish-now polish.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with good variation in sentence length and solid control of physical and sensory detail. Several sentences do efficient double duty, advancing both atmosphere and psychology. There is some drift toward abstraction and repetition—conceptual restatements of trauma and enhancement, and a few slightly purple phrasings—that could be tightened for greater punch. Figurative language remains coherent and doesn’t obscure causality, but the prose rarely surprises at the line level in a way commensurate with top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean yet musical, with good variation in length and no serious syntactic clutter or confusion. Images are generally concrete and legible (“bottled starlight,” “canvas scraps, each one stitched with hidden details”), and there’s minimal paraphrase looping. Some abstractions and repeated conceptual terms (“anchor of intuition,” “overlooked histories,” “between worlds”) edge toward mild redundancy and soften impact. The prose remains clear and propulsive enough that these do not materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax, few redundancies, and a high density of purposeful images (“each flake a witness to silences too heavy for the air” is representative). However, metaphor and elevated phrasing are nearly continuous, creating a slightly purple, over-saturated texture that can blur impact. A few abstractions and echoed constructions (“weightless burden,” “architecture” of the past) feel like minor scaffolding rather than sharp, scene-advancing moves. Overall propulsion and clarity remain intact, but light trimming would sharpen effect.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with many lines doing dual work for atmosphere and theme (“his hands stained with ink as if he were trying to hold the night itself”). Sentence rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and there are few, if any, true scaffold or paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; a couple of stacked metaphors (“glass orchard library… swirling sea of clouds… endless haze… fractured rainbows”) flirt with excess yet stop short of genuine muddle. Information remains clear through the climax and ending, which preserves the closure image’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose shows solid rhythmic control, varied sentence structure, and high information density; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Metaphoric language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned (“light…spooling like golden thread,” “storm of time”). There is minor purple drift in places and some phrases that echo the same emotional register, yet it rarely slows momentum or muddies sense. No major scaffold, loops, or clarity issues appear at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty in worldbuilding and mood. Images like “gears of forgotten melodies and springs of lapsed time” and “filaments of starlight he had collected during the last meteor shower” feel specific rather than stock. That said, figurative density is high throughout, and a few phrases repeat function (e.g., multiple invocations of light, resonance, and twilight) in ways that could be tightened for impact. The language is strong and near-publishable, but trimming a bit of ornamentation would sharpen momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are clear, generally concise, and multi-functional, often advancing setting, character, and theme at once. There is some density of figurative language (“petrichor collector,” “auditory clearing,” “conversation with stone,” “earth’s fleeting emotions”) that flirts with purple but usually lands as controlled, distinctive texture. A few phrases restate similar ideas (silence/hush/resonant hush) and occasional modifiers could be trimmed without loss, but these are minor. Overall momentum holds, and the final lines land cleanly without being dulled by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose often carries atmosphere and concept efficiently, with some strong images (waves “like ancient giants,” the slide’s glow mapping the walls). However, there is clear repetition and scaffold (“turbine-hum reverie,” “perpetually learning,” and restated realizations), plus some purple abstraction (“timewoven alliances made manifest,” “a scaffolding of simplicity holding the complexity of the world together”). One visible typo (“reimagineed”) and a few overloaded sentences slightly disrupt flow. Overall, the lines are competent but could be tightened and de-abstracted for high-tier literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush but generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and only occasional edges of purple. Repetition of motifs (“umbral tenderness,” seasonal shifts, night blooms) feels intentional rather than looped scaffold, and syntax varies enough to keep rhythm from becoming monotonous. A few abstract or summarizing lines where key discoveries are explained rather than embodied slightly reduce immediacy, but they don’t obscure sense or closure. Line-level craft is strong and controlled, if more decorative than absolutely necessary in places.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information; momentum is generally maintained. However, figurative density is very high, veering into purple at times (“turning his bones to water,” “ledger of grief,” “tattooed across his ribs,” “truth…a tide”), with some conceptual overlap that doesn’t always add new pressure. A few moments feel like paraphrase or intensifier layering rather than progression, which modestly dulls impact. Trimming or sharpening a handful of metaphors would lift this into a more elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and flows smoothly, with good information density and some effective images (e.g., the town “breathing with the force of his imagination”). There is mild purple-tinge and reliance on conventional phrases (“settled in his chest like lead,” “each one a deliberate act of love”), but not to the point of obscuring clarity or momentum. Sentences occasionally repeat similar emotional content in slightly different words, yet not enough to feel like structural loops, yielding a solid but not striking line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, largely free of errors, and often evocative with high information density—many sentences simultaneously advance worldbuilding, mood, and character. However, there is occasional purple stacking (e.g., “defied logic and gravity simultaneously,” “tasted of both earth and sky,” “velvet disquiet”) that risks over-saturation without always adding new pressure. Some conceptual redundancy around Elias’s role and the nature of emotional patterns could be tightened for sharper momentum. Line-level craft is strong but slightly ornamental in places, keeping it just short of elite minimality and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and often does multiple jobs at once—advancing action while deepening concept and image ("Ice crystals...their random lattices shifting into flawless geometric patterns"). Sentence variety and paragraphing are strong, and there are no major clarity or grammar lapses. However, figurative and elevated language is dense throughout, occasionally tipping into near-purple or redundancy (e.g., repeating inheritance/serenity formulations), which slightly blurs sharpness and momentum. Tightening a handful of abstract or summative lines—especially near the end—would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean, syntactically varied enough, and largely free of obvious loops or scaffolding; almost every sentence contributes to either atmosphere or Elian’s method. Occasional phrasing is mildly repetitive or expository (e.g., restating his philosophy and preparation), but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum in a low-intensity piece. Figurative language is sparing and mostly effective, without mixed metaphors or purple overload. Overall, the line-level work is solid and publishable, if not strikingly compressed or musical.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is solid: clean grammar, clear sequencing, and generally efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and idea. There is some repetition of concepts (“isolation,” “vulnerability,” “transformation”) and occasional abstraction that could be tightened into more concrete images, but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum. Figurative language is controlled and thematically aligned; there’s no major purple-prose overload or metaphor muddle. The prose is good and publishable, just not at the absolute razor-edge of compression and freshness expected in top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images like “apiary that bloomed like impossible amber” and “hues of blood and ash,” and most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, theme). There is some tendency toward repetition and abstract phrasing (“tangled covenant,” “network of consciousness,” “weight of unspoken words”) that could be sharpened into more concrete dramatization. Rhythm is varied enough not to feel mechanical, though a few lines verge on purple or redundant explanation of already-implied dynamics. Line-level craft is solid and publishable with light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with some strong phrases (“a fragile, whispered thing,” “hummed beneath his skin like a second heartbeat”). However, long, multi-clause sentences dominate, and there is a recurring pattern of repeating the same idea in slightly different words (e.g., reiterating the time capsule’s significance and Elias’s purpose). The final paragraph, in particular, leans on abstraction (“resilience of memory,” “enduring power of understanding”) rather than precise images or actions. Line-level craft is solid but not yet at the concision and multi-tasking density expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, generally economical for lyric prose, and carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful; metaphors (“tether trailing like a scarlet vein,” feather “shifting like captured twilight”) are vivid without clashing. There is some near-redundancy in abstract statements of theme and a slight risk of purple prose, yet momentum and clarity are not compromised. Overall density and rhythm would suit a high-tier literary venue with minimal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty by advancing both worldbuilding and character/state. Figurative language is sparing and apt, avoiding mixed metaphors or overwrought description, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The main limitation is a modest reliance on summary over dramatized beats in the middle, which slightly blunts line-level immediacy but doesn’t significantly harm momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally fluent, with strong images and good information density—many lines do dual work in mood and theme. However, figurative language is quite dense (“bronze quiet,” “tasting like ash,” “gaping wound to the sky,” “artificial pilgrimage dissolved into something real”), veering into purple and thematic redundancy in the final third. A bit of paraphrase-looping around “chemistry of homecoming” and the nature of the pilgrimage slightly dulls the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is often lush and evocative, and many sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, theme) with good rhythm. However, there is a persistent tilt toward overwriting: stacked abstractions (“promises kept and broken,” “ambitions of mankind and the needs of the earth”) and repeated formulations (agreements, concord, promises, harmony) create a sense of thematic paraphrase. Some metaphors and phrases feel interchangeable or generic within this register, slightly blunting impact. Tightening about 15–20% of the lines would significantly increase momentum and sharpen images without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied syntax, largely clean grammar, and high information density with minimal redundancy. Imagery is generally apt (amber, grooves, vibrations) and not over-stacked, so the prose doesn’t tip into purple. A few phrases (“wild hush,” “full of promise”) brush against familiarity, and some sentences could be trimmed for tautness, but momentum is still preserved in a reflective mode. No major artifacts or loops blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: most sentences do double duty for mood and information, and the charcoal, compass, and shimmers are rendered with clear, concrete imagery. There’s some density of metaphor and elevated phrasing, but it rarely tips into confusion or real bloat. Repetitions of similar concepts (“ruins of time,” “tomb of echoes,” “ghost in the machine”) edge toward sameness without quite becoming loops. Tightening a few decorative phrases would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid images and mostly clean syntax that keeps momentum moving. There is, however, a tendency toward purple or clichéd constructions in the final third (“infinite and waiting,” “canvas of possibility,” “the game was over, but the playing had just begun”) and some conceptual redundancy around Kaelen’s new role. A few adjacent sentences rephrase similar ideas about purpose, wonder, and the future without adding pressure. These issues don’t obscure causality or closure but do slightly blunt the sharpness of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong—rhythmic sentences, high information density, and images that work in multiple registers (sound, gesture, metaphor). Repetition of key phrases and structures mostly feels patterned rather than accidental, and clarity is rarely in doubt. There is some mild overwriting and self-explanation of metaphors, which blunts impact (“became a metaphor,” reiterated descriptors like “benevolently ruthless”). Trimming a few redundant explanatory lines would further tighten momentum and elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Imagery is vivid without becoming incoherent, and there are few if any true loops or scaffolding lines. However, figurative language and modifiers are quite abundant, flirting with purple in places (e.g., “shadows thick as velvet,” “something metallic and eternal”), and pressure beats are often cushioned instead of sharpened. A bit more pruning or contrast between plain and ornate sentences would heighten momentum and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and some striking lines, and it reads smoothly without genuine confusion. That said, there is a tendency toward purple prose and piling of metaphors (“woven hush,” “each stone slick with the memory of rain,” “phantom pieces on an invisible board”) that occasionally feel redundant rather than additive. A few phrases and beats echo (e.g., “He fidgets productively” twice, several “fierce repose”/“nothing left to lose” type constructions), which could be tightened. Despite this, clarity and momentum hold, and the closure image is not dulled.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is mostly clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with images doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and emotional color). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and not excessively purple; there are few, if any, outright muddled metaphors. Some phrases and concepts recur a bit abstractly (“price of forgiveness,” “innocently mischievous nature”), but not to the point of real drag or confusion. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication with only minor tightening to reduce conceptual repetition and sharpen key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, with relatively clean syntax, strong verb choices, and a good information density—most sentences do multiple jobs. The figurative layer (kintsugi, quilting memories, acid as oblivion, golden intent) is rich and mostly coherent, but the frequency of heightened imagery flirts with purple, especially in the final third. There is some conceptual repetition (“kintsugi intentions,” statements of purpose) that could be pared without loss. Still, momentum and clarity are preserved; no major loops or artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong images (“droplets from the ceiling like tiny metronomes marking time’s passing”). At times, it risks purple density and conceptual repetition—similar insights about promises, memory, and what can’t be held are stated multiple ways in close succession. Some abstractions slightly blunt momentum by telling what images already imply. Still, clarity is maintained throughout, and most sentences do double duty in atmosphere and character rather than feeling like pure ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally tight, and densely multi-functional (advancing mood, world, and character at once). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and largely grounded in the story’s sensory palette (air, scent, light, thread). There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the narrative moves cleanly from setup to climax without slack paragraphs. A very slight tendency toward abstraction in phrases like “screaming tenderness” is more aesthetic risk than liability but keeps this just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for mood and character (“each patch a memory of places he’d once known”). There is some repetition of concepts (grief, loss, navigation, solace) and a few near-thesis lines that could be tightened or implied instead. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure sense. Momentum holds across the piece, though trimming a few explanatory or summarizing sentences would further sharpen it for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: rhythm varies, information density is good, and most lines do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion). A few phrases repeat conceptual terrain (“storm-battered ravine,” “psychological safety”) and some metaphorical choices (“fractured grace”) verge on slightly conventional for literary SF, but they don’t meaningfully blur clarity or momentum. Expository blocks about the empathy virus and the textbook risk slight heaviness, though they are fairly efficient. The final paragraphs land cleanly, with no noticeable loops or syntactic artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. At times it drifts into purple or redundant abstraction—phrases like “softly persistent pull,” “shared connection transcended time and death,” and “eternal language of human hearts” repeat or rephrase the same emotional idea rather than advancing it. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are several memorable, well-controlled images (e.g., blood that “remembered what oceans forgot”). Strong line craft with some excess thematic telling.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and economical for the most part, with strong information density—many sentences carry setting, mood, and character in one move. Images like “maps—none of them of places, but of choices” are both clear and suggestive, and the syntax varies enough to keep momentum. There is some mild purple strain (e.g., “the night bloomed outside,” “a quiet acknowledgment”) and a few slightly redundant phrasings, but they don’t significantly bog the piece or blur meaning. Line-level control is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level work is polished, with strong images (“starlight bled down stone walls in silver rivulets that dried to rust”) and mostly clean syntax. Some sentences verge on purple, stacking abstractions and modifiers in ways that risk density without always increasing precision, but clarity is retained. There are no major loops, scaffolding, or mechanical errors, and information density is appropriate for the length. Slight trimming of metaphor clusters and a bit more variation in sentence structure under peak pressure would sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally elegant and controlled, with strong sensory and imagistic density; many lines do multiple jobs (world, theme, and character at once). However, metaphor and abstraction are piled high in places (“density of presence,” “palette of resolve,” “temporal elasticity,” “revaluing the very concept of memory”), creating a faint purple haze and mild redundancy. Despite that, clarity and momentum mostly hold, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images like “feral nostalgia” and “dusk painted the mountain peaks in bruised purples” are striking without becoming incoherent, and most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose leans dense and lyrical, but figurative language is mostly controlled and thematically apt. A touch of abstraction in some philosophical lines keeps it from feeling absolutely razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, mostly concise, and often do double duty for mood and characterization. Motifs like mist, glass, dripping water, and scratched metal recur in a purposeful way rather than as checklist description. There is minor redundancy and some sentimental phrasing, particularly in the last third where insights are occasionally told rather than left in image, which slightly dulls the sharpness of the final beats. Still, information density and rhythm are solidly above average.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without padding, and figurative language is rich but coherent (“crystal-edge of stress,” “island of warmth” within the hush). There are no significant loops or scaffolding; each paragraph advances either the ritual or its emotional consequences. The density of metaphor flirts with overload in places, but because the semantic field (storms, stone, breath) is tightly curated, it doesn’t blur sense or closure. The final image—cold tea, smoothed scar, ordinary quill—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, with good rhythm and a healthy density of information; sentences often carry worldbuilding, mood, and character at once. Occasional metaphors (“gravel and starlight,” “language of pure energy”) are vivid and mostly apt, though the accumulation edges toward ornate in places. There’s minimal redundancy and no serious clarity issues or mechanical errors. A touch more restraint, especially in peak emotional beats, would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is polished, with many sentences doing dual work for atmosphere and concept, and the rhythm of long, flowing clauses suits the meditative tone. That said, figurative language is very dense (“scaffolding of reality,” “shattered mirror with no reflection,” “resounding hush”) and often stacked, flirting with purple prose and conceptual repetition around “reality,” “truth,” and “cosmic illusions.” The final third remains clear but could sharpen by trimming a few abstract restatements of the same stakes. There are no serious clarity errors or scaffolding loops, but a demanding editor would ask for some tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, grammatical, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; sentences pull their weight in developing setting, character, and concept simultaneously. There is some mild redundancy in rephrasing the clocks’ role (measure/define/impose/illusion), and a few phrases (“eminently peculiar,” “fjord quiet”) get leaned on more than needed. Figurative language is controlled and not overwrought, and the rhythm is readable if a bit even. Line-level craft is strong enough for solid venues but not yet razor-sharp or maximally compressed for top-tier literary competition.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and images like “the words hanging like spores between them” are apt and memorable. Description is dense but usually purposeful, with relatively few outright redundancies or scaffolding phrases. That said, the piece occasionally verges on purple prose and repeats key metaphors (“permeable barriers,” “quiet wildfire”) in ways that feel a bit on-the-nose. The language remains lucid and propulsive enough, but restraint and pruning would sharpen impact for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmic, varied, and often carry multiple jobs at once (image, theme, character). Motifs like rain, lantern light, and gambling metaphors thread the piece cohesively, and there are few, if any, outright clumsy lines. However, some phrasing drifts toward the purple or clichéd (“fragile as a dried leaf,” “fragile, hopeful dawn,” “the words felt like a jackpot”), and thematic statements occasionally repeat their point. Trimming a handful of redundant or over-explanatory sentences could sharpen momentum and give the best images more room to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and controlled, with rich but not overwrought imagery and a good sense of rhythm across sentences and paragraphs. Most lines multitask—advancing worldbuilding, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few sentences are dense and summary-like, contributing to a sense of conceptual rather than dramatic movement, but they don’t obscure meaning. There are no notable line-level artifacts, mixed metaphors, or syntactic glitches that mar key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and often do double duty for mood and information. The motifs (walnut-ink, jars, blooming jetty) are woven through without egregious redundancy, though some phrases and concepts are repeated in near-synonym form (“haunted euphoria,” “gently thorough,” covenant explanations). A tendency toward abstraction (“context changes,” “weight of small moments”) occasionally softens impact where a more concrete beat could carry the same meaning. Nonetheless, the closing paragraph lands with a clean, legible image and no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense, with vivid metaphors that usually serve character and theme (“vacuum in his chest,” “dry leaves skittering across concrete”). Sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. There are moments of over-explanation and explicit statement of insight where the line-level could trust implication more, and a few metaphors tread familiar ground. Still, clarity and propulsion remain strong, and no figurative muddle harms the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—most sentences serve both atmosphere and interiority. However, figurative language is stacked densely (“liquid sunlight,” “lover’s sigh,” “quiet blaze”) and occasionally leans purple, risking sameness of texture. There are no serious clarity issues or loops, but some metaphors feel interchangeable rather than sharply specific to Kael. Trimming or sharpening a few of these would heighten impact and avoid sentimentality creep.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally tight, with vivid, sensical metaphors and good information density—most lines do double duty for atmosphere and concept. The recurring long noun phrases (“the dried-up fountain pen with its exotic nib”) are occasionally over-elaborated and repeated, which introduces mild feel of redundancy. Rhythm is varied enough to keep momentum in a reflective piece, and there are no major clarity issues or figurative muddles. Trimming a few reiterative lines and slightly de-purple-ing certain spots would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong sensory images (“each ripple a faint seam of silver”) and good rhythmic variation. However, figurative language is nearly constant and sometimes redundant or over-explanatory (“its lens empty of film but full of purpose,” “cage of glass and metal”), creating a sense of purple density that slightly dulls impact. Several sentences paraphrase similar emotional states (bittersweet joy/sorrow/joy and grief) without adding new precision. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact; the issue is excess ornament rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished, with good rhythm, strong verbs, and high information density; most sentences do more than one job. There are memorable images and metaphors, though they cluster toward a similar volcanic/fire register that risks mild repetition, and there’s at least one typo (“acntmporary”). The middle summary paragraph is efficient rather than lush, helping momentum. Overall, line craft is solidly above average but could be tightened by trimming a few slightly purple or redundant turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clear and occasionally striking, with some strong sensory metaphors (sound waves bending light into “shimmering curtains,” auroras that “wept and sang”). However, the line-level often leans into repetition and purple density—phrases like “auric lagoon under starlight,” “hush of the universe inhaling/exhaling,” and “entangled memories” recur so frequently they begin to feel like scaffolding. Sentence length and cadence are relatively uniform, creating a slightly droning rhythm. The closure image remains legible, but tighter pruning and more varied syntax would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with some strong images (“city of steel giants,” “storm’s song”). Information density is good; description usually does double duty by advancing world-building and mood. There is mild repetition of key words and some near-platitudinous phrasing at the end, but no major loops, purple stacks, or syntactic monotony. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but lacks the surprising turns of phrase or rigorous compression characteristic of elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is generally polished and musical, with strong images like puddles holding the sky and tears as tributaries. There is some purple-leaning repetition (“profound understanding of human fragility,” “stillwater tension,” “spiralingly calm”) and summarizing abstractions that could be pared for sharpness. Nonetheless, sentences usually carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, theme), and momentum is maintained without obvious scaffolding or loops. The final paragraphs risk mild over-explanation but still land on a clear, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rich in image, and generally multi-purpose, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. A few metaphors and phrases repeat (“the hush where past meets prophecy,” “cradling” ideas/hope), at times flirting with over-poeticizing rather than sharpening pressure. There’s very little scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm on the page reads clean. Overall, the prose feels deliberate and refined, with only minor tendencies toward purple flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, vivid, and largely efficient; sentences often carry dual loads of atmosphere and psychology (“moved like liquid,” “tender ferocity”). There are some mild repetitions and abstracted statements of theme and emotion that could be trimmed or made more concrete, especially regarding “freedom,” “true nature,” and “violence.” Figurative language is generally apt rather than overwrought, and syntax varies pleasantly. With a modest reduction in summary-like thematic phrasing, this would be fully publication-ready at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly economical, with several strong images (the “remade hush,” shavings “like snow,” turbines as “mechanical breath”). There’s some repetition of sentence templates (“The X [verb]s…”) and a few lines of thematic telling that could be tightened without loss. Figurative language is controlled and rarely purple, and there are no major clarity or momentum-sapping artifacts. Line-by-line, it is more than publication-ready, though not consistently astonishing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose shows strong line-level craft: varied sentence structures, generally clean syntax, and a high density of vivid images that build a thick atmosphere. There is a tendency toward stacked metaphors and repeated formulations (“not a place but a state of being,” “not as emptiness but as potential”) that edge into mild purple prose and paraphrase loops. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained; cause and effect are easy to follow and the closure image lands cleanly. Trimming some redundancies and modulating figurative intensity would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clear sequencing, and largely efficient lines that do double duty (worldbuilding plus character, or atmosphere plus theme). Figurative language is present but not overwhelming, and most metaphors are coherent and apt for the world and Leo’s perspective. There is minor lushness (“searing the sky,” “sliver of potential against a field of nothing”) that occasionally nears purple, yet it doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or technical stumbles that would impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally smooth and readable, with some striking images (the spectrum of muted hues “like memories caught in amber”). However, there is a tendency toward repetition and abstraction—phrases like “artificial pilgrimage,” “texture of connection,” “powerfully gentle,” and “golden shadows” recur with slight paraphrase, creating a mild sense of conceptual looping. Figurative density is high and occasionally veers into purple, but not to the point of obscuring meaning. Tighter pruning of redundant lines and a few abstractions would strengthen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: rhythmic variation, vivid images, and good information density without obvious scaffolding or loops. Phrases like “caught between day and night, between yesterday and forever” and “where the genuinely artificial became authentically true” are effective and resonant. At times the diction veers toward purple or expository (“His teaching style shaped by his own journey through despair's deepest valleys”), summarizing emotional states rather than dramatizing them. Still, clarity is never in doubt, and the prose supports rather than muddies the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally smooth, well-paced, and free of mechanical errors, with some strong images (“metallic ruler of destiny,” “rain-beaded stars”). Sentences tend to carry more than one job (setting + character + theme) without becoming too bogged down. There are a few generic or overfamiliar phrases (“like a phoenix ritual,” “too important not to map”) and moments of explanatory redundancy that slightly dull momentum. Overall, it’s competent and occasionally striking, but not yet line-for-line exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lines are grammatically clean and mostly concise, and the rhythm is readable without major scaffolding or confusion. That said, there is noticeable repetition of motifs and phrasing (“atoms of nostalgia,” “end of innocence,” “steadily unpredictable”) without new inflection, and several sentences paraphrase the same idea at a similar level of abstraction, giving the piece a slightly generic, essayistic feel in places rather than maximally taut scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely graceful, with strong imagery (“shadows stretch like fingers across floating gardens,” “scent of blooming knowledge”) and good information density. There is some repetition of key phrases and concepts (“by comparing silent video footage from decades apart,” multiple “metamorphosis” mentions) that edges toward scaffolding rather than fresh deepening. Abstract, almost bureaucratic phrasing in a few lines (“hope-preservation protocols”) slightly clashes with the otherwise organic poetics. Overall rhythm and clarity hold, and the final paragraph lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, largely free of syntactic errors, and often efficient, with some strong images (“quiet vividness,” “shimmering stillness”) that double as emotional cues. There is minor repetition and some adjective-stacking, and phrases like “deepcretion” read as either a typo or awkward coinage, slightly disturbing the surface. Overall, the lines carry atmosphere and information without significant drag or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is often strong and image-rich—the coffee rings, silver sand, and “meteor hush” are memorable and multi-function. Yet there’s a tendency toward over-explicit restatement and stacked abstractions (“displaced miracle,” “awareness,” “closure comes not from erasing, but from reading”) that could be more efficiently dramatized. The stray string “crisis_line_748” and the slightly clotted explanatory final paragraph undercut polish and momentum. Overall the prose is promising and frequently striking but not yet at the ruthless tightness expected for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid figurative language and good information density—many lines do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Phrases like “outtakes from a lost musical,” “a tune for which forgotten lyrics searched endlessly,” and “editing-room floors of reality” are memorable and apt. There is some mild redundancy and tendency toward stacked metaphors (thunder, storms, echoes, incubating) that push the boundary of overwriting but rarely obscure sense. Line-level rhythm is varied and clean, with no major scaffolding, syntactic monotony, or clarity failures.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with some strong images (the meteor as a “golden tear in the night,” stardust coating her hands at the end). At the same time, modifiers and figurative language are densely stacked, leading to purple overtones and occasional redundancy (multiple mentions of stardust as “remembered” or “residue,” repeated aurora shimmerings). Sentence length and structure trend long and similar, which can dull momentum in what should be peak beats. Tightening repetition and pruning some metaphors would sharpen impact without sacrificing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is inventive yet largely coherent and not over-stacked in any one paragraph; repetition (“Through wave functions…”) reads as purposeful motif rather than loop. There are a few abstract phrases where a slightly more concrete embodiment of feeling or cost could deepen impact, but clarity and momentum never notably suffer. The final lines land cleanly and re-energize prior images without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with few outright redundancies and a clear sequence of actions. Many sentences carry dual loads of worldbuilding and theme, and rhythm has some variation. Yet the prose leans toward purple in places, with repeated abstract formulations (“hum of insight,” “wild frontier of your mind,” “probable miracle”) that start to feel like conceptual reiteration rather than fresh image. These patterns slightly blunt momentum and the sharpness of the closing cadence, keeping it from the tautness expected in elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is fluent and often musical, with some memorable images (the ticket punch creating stars, possibilities reflected in water). Yet metaphor and motif are overused: shoreline/wave/foam imagery and repeated thesis phrases create a mild sense of looped language. Several sentences restate the same conceptual point with new ornament, which dampens momentum in such a short piece. Line-level clarity remains high, but tighter pruning and more selective figuration would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, largely economical, and often do double duty describing both environment and mindset. There are some tendencies toward purple or redundant phrasing (“frostbitten hope,” “cold, quiet fire,” multiple mentions of cobalt and silence) that risk dulling impact through repetition. The rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and crucial beats (discovering and using the bolt, opening the piano, reading the ledger) are lucid. Trimming a few abstract restatements of theme and some adjective stacking would elevate the prose to a more elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, with high information density and images that usually pull double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Rhythm alternates between expansive, summary-like lines and tighter, climactic phrasing at the end, keeping momentum. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent; there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn. A few phrases verge on purple or redundant (“graceful collapse” reappears, some abstractions like “stolen world” recur), but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority (“the world quieter but not healed,” “colors bleeding into the water like ghosts”). Figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent, and the rhythmic variation reads well aloud. Some lines near the end repeat concepts already established or slide into abstract formulations, adding a trace of redundancy and softening momentum. Still, there are no major artifacts or muddles, and line-level craft is clearly above typical submissions.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with smooth syntax, clear sequencing, and mostly efficient sentences that advance mood and character. Some metaphors and phrases are conventional or repeated (“awkwardly confident,” galaxy imagery), and there’s a minor artifact in “theater of废弃ed dreams,” plus a touch of purple in stacked abstractions (“thunderous serenity”). The figurative density edges toward heavy but doesn’t cross into confusion. Trimming a few redundant or on-the-nose lines would further sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clear, grammatically clean, and generally concise; most sentences carry more than one layer of work (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus interiority). There is some repetition of conceptual terms (“tradition,” “reconstructed”) and occasional near-thesis lines, but outright scaffolding or paraphrase loops are limited. Figurative language (e.g., “earth’s heated womb,” “roots remember”) is mostly apt and not over-stacked. Rhythm could be more varied and a few abstract or summarizing sentences trimmed, but line-level craft is solid and never obscures sense.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong: varied sentence rhythm, good information density, and metaphors that mostly align and reinforce one another. Recurrent phrases like “quietly talented hands” and a tendency to restate insights in abstract terms create minor redundancy. There is some risk of over-explication in the last third, but not enough to stall momentum or obscure images. Line-level control is solid and nearly publication-ready with a light tightening pass.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often striking, with several strong images (splintered box like fractured memories, shelves sagging under questions). Yet figurative language is dense and sometimes repetitive—threads, fractures, light/dark, and “ache” recur so often that they begin to blur rather than sharpen meaning. There are mild paraphrase loops where lines restate the same emotional content in different words, softening momentum. Overall, solid but edging toward purple in places.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and mostly well-paced, with clear syntax and a cohesive visual rhythm; sentences often carry more than one layer of information (action, mood, and concept). There is some repetition and mild purple drift, especially in thematic restatements and metaphor stacks around time, patterns, and disappearance. A few lines act as scaffold or paraphrase what’s already visible in the scene, slightly dulling momentum. Overall, line-level craft is solid but not yet pruned to the density and precision expected at top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean at the grammar and usage level, and individual images (servers humming under snow, flickering terminal light) are strong. Yet there is notable paraphrase and phrase-level looping—“echoing library under snow,” “contraband truths,” “the blink that follows surprise” recur with diminishing marginal return—and the final third tilts toward purple, declarative rhetoric. Many sentences restate the same emotional or thematic point without adding new pressure, which blunts momentum and line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong nouns and specific images (plant resin, velvet around the knife, microscopic etchings) and good line-level clarity. There is some redundancy in concepts (“tranquil blaze,” “engraved quiet,” repeated summaries of her purpose) and frequent abstract intensifiers (“violent profession,” “devastating collapse,” “slow progress toward normalcy”) that could be pruned. Figurative language is mostly apt, though occasionally leaning toward the decorative rather than doing new work. The piece maintains momentum for a reflective mode, but a tighter, less reiterated line would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, largely free of scaffolding or loops, and maintains good momentum despite its lyric density; nearly every sentence carries imagistic or conceptual weight. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with only minor redundancy (“profound and cosmic sorrow” type stacking) and no mixed metaphors that impede clarity. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final lines land with a strong, earned cadence. The main drag is mild overwriting in places, where cumulative modifiers could be pared without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with evocative images such as the celestial sphere spinning “like a slow, deliberate regret” and efficient integration of exposition into action. Sentences are mostly lean and multipurpose, maintaining momentum despite reflective content. There are a few mild redundancies and moments where logical explanation becomes somewhat essayistic (“But grief didn't bend a pen nib; force did.”) rather than fully dramatized. Figurative language is controlled overall, avoiding mixed metaphors or heavy purple patches.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty—worldbuilding and emotion—while maintaining a smooth rhythm; there are few, if any, true clarity issues. Some figurative density veers toward purple or redundant (“sounds become trapped in the spaces between moments,” “meteor hush,” “cosmic alphabet of loss and memory”), and several sentences explain what’s already clear from context. The backstory about the device’s purpose and the daughter’s cries is delivered in somewhat expository blocks rather than through fully dramatized beats, slightly sapping momentum. Nonetheless, the prose remains clean, grammatically sound, and largely propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences flow, rhythm varies, and metaphors are mostly apt and legible. The prose does risk purple density, with frequent figurative turns and repeated motifs (“lilac” + an abstract noun) that occasionally feel redundant rather than additive. Nonetheless, clarity is never seriously compromised, and most lines do more than one job (atmosphere, character, and concept). A slight trim of repeated emotional formulations would heighten impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean and clear, with few genuine clunkers and a solid sense of rhythm and image selection. There is, however, a noticeable accumulation of abstract nouns and repeated constructions (“warm coldness,” “empathy in arms of steel,” “aberrant mercy”) that occasionally feel redundant or over-signaled rather than letting earlier images stand. Some sentences paraphrase prior ideas without adding pressure, which modestly slows momentum in a short piece. The figurative language stays coherent, but trimming repetition and leaning more on concrete embodiment would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and economical, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding and mood, or character and theme). Figurative language (“dust motes that danced in moonbeams,” “fruits humming with melodies”) is frequent but controlled, rarely tipping into muddle or redundancy. Transitions are smooth, and there’s little scaffold or paraphrase-looping; information flows clearly toward the climax. It borders on purple in places, but not enough to slow momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and images that usually do double duty for setting and theme. Some tendencies toward purple/ornamental phrasing and repetition (“fractally precise” appears twice; a few stacked modifiers) nibble at concision but don’t obscure sense. Momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode, and key beats are dramatized rather than summarized. Tightening a few adjective-heavy lines would raise this closer to elite-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is smooth and readable, with mostly clear syntax, reasonable variation in sentence rhythm, and some effective images (the leaf’s veins “like a message from another era,” the humming like a “forgotten song”). There are mild tendencies toward cliché or redundancy (“her heart pounding with a newfound clarity,” repeated formulations of glow and humming) and occasional over-explanation of insights. Still, there is little genuine clutter, and the prose sustains momentum without major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and mostly concise, with clear sequencing and sensory density that supports mood. There is some repetition of concepts and phrasings (truth/prophecy “unraveled,” “spun into raw possibility,” “quietly inspired”) that adds a faint sense of scaffolding. Figurative language remains coherent but sometimes drifts toward abstraction and sentimentality in the closing paragraphs. Overall momentum survives, yet a sharper pruning of redundant moralizing lines would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images and mostly efficient sentences that carry atmosphere and meaning simultaneously. There is some tendency toward purple or stacked figurative language (“ectoplasmic water,” “map of their failed trust,” “cracking a bone” for unfolding paper), and thematic phrases are repeated in ways that slightly blunt their impact. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, rhythm is varied, and there are few if any syntactic or logical stumbles. Tightening a handful of metaphors and trimming redundant conceptual statements would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally graceful and rhythmic, with strong sensory images (dripping hat, ticking gutters, fog softening edges) and minimal scaffolding. Some figurative language feels layered but controlled; only occasionally does it veer toward purple or redundancy (“spindrift serenity” appears twice, and “distill complexity into essence” is somewhat abstract). Sentences mostly carry multiple jobs—advancing mood, character, and situation together—so momentum is maintained despite the quiet plot. There are no major loops or syntactic artifacts that obscure meaning, though a touch more concision at the end could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“a frozen amber tear in the fabric of the now,” “a sunbeam in a small, dark room”) and generally clean syntax; nearly every sentence does more than one job in building atmosphere and concept. There is some tendency toward dense figurative stacking, but the metaphors remain coherent and don’t slip into confusion or mixed vehicles. Momentum holds despite the lyricism; there’s little in the way of scaffolding, repetition, or clunky exposition. The line-level isn’t quite transcendent—occasionally telling creeps in—but it is consistently high-quality and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally clear, varied, and purposeful, with minimal redundancy and clean grammar; many lines carry both image and thematic work efficiently. The prose occasionally lapses into abstraction or mild sentimentality (“spiritual darkness of winter,” “something beautiful about to unfold”) that feels less sharp than the concrete details. Some phrases echo (“working with the rhythm of oars in water”) without adding new pressure, but not enough to significantly drag momentum. Line-level control is solid and smooth, even if not formally dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often evocative, with some strong images (the sundial marking “cosmic cycles of her perennial existence,” the library as tidal with her emotions). However, there is a tendency toward repetition and abstract phrasing (“brittle awakenings,” “atomically reflective,” “translate…into a form of independent strength”) that blurs impact and slows momentum. Many sentences do similar conceptual work, leading to a mild sense of overwriting and paraphrase-loop rather than tight compression. The closure image is clear, but line-level density could be pared for sharper force.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and evocative but generally controlled imagery. The prose often does double duty, advancing both atmosphere and theme without obvious redundancy. Some metaphoric layering (“each drop a tiny, shattered jewel,” “a magnificent skein…like a colossal, metallic God's-wort”) edges toward lushness but stops short of obscuring clarity or momentum. There are no significant scaffolding loops or syntactic artifacts dragging the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and readable, with solid grammar and clear sequencing; there are no major loops or confusing artifacts. That said, many sentences perform single functions (telling us stakes, backstory, or conclusions) rather than layering image, emotion, and action. Key beats—the test at 2:17 AM, the degradation of the signals—are compressed into summary, which reduces immediacy and momentum. The prose rarely takes formal or figurative risks, resulting in competent but somewhat flat line-level texture.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is largely fluent and dense with information; many sentences pull double-duty for worldbuilding and mood. Imagery such as “starlight fractured into prismatic shards that danced like captured auroras” is vivid and mostly coherent. Still, the story leans heavily on abstract nouns and repeated formulations (“spatial mutiny,” “reverberation of a lonely church organ,” “vital key lost to time”), creating mild redundancy and a touch of purple. Occasional tightening and pruning of near-duplicate ideas would increase propulsion without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong noun-verb choices and generally high information density—most sentences advance both image and theme. Extended metaphors like the quarry’s “stone lips” and “furrowed hush” verge on ornate but remain coherent and purposeful rather than simply decorative. There is little to no paraphrase looping or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies and supports the meditative pace. A touch of purple-leaning density in spots is the only notable drag on an otherwise publication-ready line level.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and easy to follow, with solid information density—most sentences either advance plot or reinforce mood. There is some redundancy and scaffolding (repeated use of “spongey dread,” “nervously confident,” and summary-like lines of understanding) that slightly blunts momentum and subtlety. Figurative language is mostly restrained but occasionally lands awkwardly (“spongey dread,” “reversible exile”) or tells what the image already implies. The closure paragraph is serviceable but leans on explanation of meaning rather than letting the final image and action (pocketing the nail, stepping out) carry more of the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and often do double duty with atmosphere and information. There are some purple or slogan-like phrases (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’,” “digitalized pardon”) and a tendency toward conceptual labels over concrete embodiment in key beats. Exposition about the map and the amnesty occasionally summarizes what could be dramatized, but the prose doesn’t loop or bog down severely. Rhythm holds, and the final paragraphs land a clean, image-supported cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely tight and purposeful, with strong images and minimal scaffolding; sentences often do double duty in advancing both scene and theme. There is some recurrence of key phrases (“polished calm,” “perceptively calm,” “some paths circle back”) that edges toward thematic hammering but doesn’t quite become a loop problem. Figurative language is generally controlled and apt, and there are no mixed metaphors or dense purple patches that obscure sense. A bit more pruning of abstract summary around the startup arc could heighten momentum, but line-level craft is solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally well-paced, with a few effective images (“brass fittings gleaming in the moonlight,” “pulsing dance beyond the telescope lens”). There is some repetition of conceptual phrasing (“as understanding dawned,” “midnight solace,” “shared burden”) and a tendency toward summary in the closing paragraphs. Still, sentences usually carry multiple functions (setting plus emotion plus plot) and avoid obvious purple excess. Line-level craft is solid but not strikingly economical or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences are generally clear and grammatical, with a consistent rhythm and some strong images (trees “bending and unbending in a dance of destruction and renewal”). There is noticeable repetition and scaffolding—multiple sentences start with “The druid…” and several lines paraphrase the same emotional state (“guarded heart,” “layers…cracking,” “frozen confession”). Some abstract, telling formulations and mild purple tendencies blunt immediacy instead of sharpening it. Solid line work but not yet trimmed or varied enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid figurative language and good rhythmic variation; lines often do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some purple density and mild repetition (e.g., “anxious elation” invoked twice, “root-bound visionary” labeled rather than always dramatized), but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or stall momentum. Metaphors largely cohere and match the world’s logic, though a few (“both blue and the absence of blue”) flirt with decorative ambiguity. Overall, information density and clarity remain high enough for literary-market expectations, but a ruthless line edit could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory images like “tree roots snake between bones” and “the taste was of hope, sharp and sweet” doing multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies well and paragraphs move the scene forward without padding. There is some mild redundancy and a few lines that veer toward sentimental abstraction, especially in the closing reflections, but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Overall information density and line-level control are high for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clean, vivid, and multi-functional, and metaphors like the tube amp “warming up” or dynamite as drums are apt and grounded. There is some repetition of phrasing and concept (“motivation to discover purpose after loss” appears almost as label; the before/after dichotomy is restated), and a few sentences explain what’s already implied by image. The figuration is dense but not quite overripe, staying coherent and readable. Momentum holds throughout despite the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with strong images (“branches that seemed to contain entire constellations of information”) and efficient exposition. Sentence variety and paragraphing support a contemplative cadence that fits the material. There are moments of mild purple and abstraction (“mathematics of continuation,” “philosophy rendered in equations,” the final generalized dictum), and some thematic repetition that could be tightened. Still, line-level craft is above average and never obscures sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, and the metaphors (fish into ink, gears as memories) are coherent and support the world’s logic. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and most sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. There is some mild redundancy and a tendency toward elevated diction that occasionally feels generic-lyric rather than uniquely character-driven, but it doesn’t obscure sense or slow momentum significantly in this quiet mode. With a bit of tightening around repeated abstractions (“wonder,” “routine,” “serenity”), this would read as fully publication-ready at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally fluid, grammatically clean, and rhythmically aware, with several strong images (the flashlight’s rainbows, the incandescent ceiling of light). Line-level density is good, but there’s a tendency toward repeated constructions and conceptual redundancy, especially around key motifs (“abandoned hopes,” “walls,” “latent radiance”), which can feel a bit like thematic scaffolding. The figurative language verges on purple in places without quite tipping into muddle, and there are mild paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate similar ideas. It’s solid, publishable prose that would benefit from a tightening pass to strip abstractions and lean harder on fresh particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images and efficient integration of action, reflection, and setting. There are some line-level redundancies and phrase loops (e.g., “daringly methodical,” “bathroom graffiti wisdom had alluded”) and occasional purple or abstract turns that aren’t strictly necessary. Despite this, momentum holds, syntax varies, and key beats remain clear and charged. A tight edit could easily push this to a higher tier without structural rewrites.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally smooth, with strong images and minimal syntactic clutter; most sentences do more than one job. Some repetition (“documented carefully,” “documenting,” “her final observation”) and conceptual phrasing at the end create a slight sense of summary rather than lived immediacy. The density of abstractions rises in the final paragraphs, softening the impact of otherwise vivid motifs. Overall, the prose is solidly publishable but could be tightened and de-abstracted in key beats to heighten charge.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). A few phrases repeat conceptually (“perforated destiny,” “promise loses its glow”) and some metaphors border on purple, but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. Information is dense yet readable; almost every sentence advances character, concept, or atmosphere, and the final image of the perforated moonflower is clean and memorable. Tightening a handful of abstract or slightly overwrought lines would lift the prose into a leaner, more elite register.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically controlled, and rich in figurative language that generally holds together and serves image and tone. Some phrases and constructions recur (“threshold of stillness,” “lucidly watchful,” variations on “spark,” “static,” “silence”) in ways that edge toward redundancy rather than productive patterning. Density of modifiers and metaphors is high enough that a few lines feel slightly overworked, though clarity is never lost. Overall, the line-level craft is strong but could benefit from a light pruning for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean and readable, with a consistent rhythm and some nicely turned phrases. There is a tendency toward repetition (scallop/scalloping, vineyard hush, cycles of rebirth) and abstract restatements of the same insight, which slightly dull momentum. Some metaphors feel decorative rather than sharpening sense, contributing to a mild purple tinge. Overall, competent and occasionally striking, but in need of tightening and a bit more ruthlessness with redundancy to reach elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density: sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and characterization, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but usually apt and coherent (“apology delivered as a threat,” “passed a key through the mail slot”) rather than purple or muddled. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, meditative lines and shorter, action-oriented ones, maintaining momentum. A few abstractions (“immense void inside the mirror shard,” “desperate safety of their certainty”) flirt with overstatement, but they don’t significantly blur clarity or drag pace.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences flow, syntax varies, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some repetition of signature phrases and a slight tendency toward purple (“weaves truth carefully,” “sycamore hush”) that risks feeling mannered but doesn’t obscure meaning. Information density is good—very little feels like filler or scaffolding—and action sequencing (stone thrown, ripples, trance, emergence in the pond) is clear. With a touch more restraint and occasional cutting of redundant metaphors, this would be comfortably publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “black wings scattering like thrown ink against the pale sky” and “the dust on them was the ink” are vivid and thematically apt. Sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, mood, and character) with minimal redundancy, and the prose maintains momentum despite its reflective tilt. A few phrases edge toward purple or conceptual (“centuries of layered dust,” “grand, silent song of the world”), but they do not obscure clarity or flatten the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich without slipping into full purple; sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum. Most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus emotion), and there are few obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Some phrasing becomes slightly repetitive or abstract (“accommodates impossibilities,” “magic with soul”) and nudges toward stating rather than purely showing. Still, line-level craft is solidly above average and never obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid imagery (“paper globes floated upward like captured stars,” “a soft violet blue that hummed with crescents of gold”) and efficient progression from beat to beat. Most sentences do double duty—advancing action while building atmosphere—and there are few, if any, redundancies or scaffolding lines. The prose does verge on purple at times, leaning on familiar metaphors (“tide’s eternal dance,” “portal to answers,” “cosmic energies converged,” “veil between ordinary and extraordinary senses”) that slightly dull originality and edge toward cliché. Rhythm and clarity remain intact throughout, including at the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm is varied, and there are few outright clumsy constructions. However, there is some redundancy (“backwards prophecies” and “quietly enthusiastic” recur without always adding new nuance) and a tendency toward abstract noun clusters that dilute impact. Figurative language like “stellar doubt that permeated even the vacuum of space” is effective but occasionally flirts with purple. The prose carries momentum adequately but could be tightened for even greater density and sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“inked lines turning to liquid amber,” tentacles “curling like frozen flames”) and good sentence-level rhythm that supports the contemplative pace. There is some redundancy and mild purple tendency in the closing stretch (reiterating “echo of sacrifice,” “testament to the power of naming,” and restating his emotional state in abstract terms) that slightly blunts impact. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; metaphors stay within the established palette of light, crystal, sea, and stars. Line-level craft is above-average and publishable with relatively light tightening to cut repetition and on-the-nose summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, clean syntax, and high information density, with evocative but mostly controlled figurative language. Images like the crystalline arches refracting dawn or water tracing “the edges of a forgotten song” are vivid and purposeful. There is some tendency toward purple or stacked metaphor (“discordant symphony of loss,” “plausible impossibility”) and mild conceptual redundancy, which slightly blurs rather than sharpens pressure. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved throughout, and no line-level artifacts significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and musical, with images doing multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) in few words. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there are few, if any, genuine scaffolding or synonym loops. The figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and voice-appropriate rather than purple for its own sake. Minor redundancies and slightly over-packed metaphors exist but do not materially dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, largely free of redundancy, and maintains good momentum despite its descriptive density. Many sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character, and the images are mostly coherent and well-judged (“waterfall shattered light into a million dancing prisms” is precise and vivid). There is a mild tendency toward purple or abstract phrasing in peak beats (“pure, unadulterated understanding,” “air thickening with possibility”), but it doesn’t seriously obscure clarity or dull the closure image. Line-level control is strong enough for competitive markets, though not razor-cut flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme) without collapsing into confusion, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Recurrent images (static, echoes, patterns, burden) build texture rather than pure redundancy, and there are no major scaffolding or synonym loops that stall momentum. However, the prose occasionally flirts with purple and explicit restatement—“watcher’s burden” and “trust” are invoked more as labels than necessary, and a few metaphors (e.g., “silence so profound it felt like its own heartbeat”) sit close to familiar lyricism. These minor excesses slightly dull edge and compression, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is generally tight and propulsive, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing plot, evoking mood, and revealing character). Imagery like “the brain sloshing like a dead sea” and “history rewriting itself faster now, timelines colliding like waves” is vivid and coherent with the world. There is some mild repetition and a tendency toward purple flourishes in clusters (“void swirling,” “universe frayed,” “stars realigning”), but it doesn’t obscure causality or closure. Trimming a few redundant intensifiers would sharpen an already solid line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clear, clean, and purposeful, with good balance between description and interiority. There is some mild redundancy and abstract phrasing (“storm of his mind,” “calling card from the unknown,” “fragile moment before the world could intrude”) that drift toward the familiar. The lyric register occasionally leans purple but not enough to obscure sense or momentum. Overall, line-level craft is solid but not razor-edited for maximum freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and generally purposeful figurative language. The prose sustains momentum through the ritual without obvious scaffolding or explanatory loops. A few spots edge toward purple or conceptual stacking (“symphony of sorrow,” “archaeologist of emotion,” “séance…with parental love”), which could be pared for even greater force. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and the closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense yet purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty—advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle; motifs of light, mist, and interiorization repeat with clear intentionality rather than looped redundancy. Rhythm varies well between long, meditative lines and tighter, more pressurized sentences around the pendant’s “violation.” It borders on ornate in places, and a touch more spareness might heighten contrast, but clarity and momentum are preserved throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is generally polished, grammatically sound, and rhythmically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, there is a noticeable density of high-register abstractions and repeated key terms (“creative destruction,” “successive approximation,” “vivify”) that at times feel like conceptual loops rather than fresh turns of the screw. Embodied, concrete beats are comparatively sparse, which blurs some moments that could be sharpened by physical specificity. The prose is strong enough for serious consideration but would benefit from pruning and a better balance between image and idea.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally high: vivid imagery, clean syntax, and good rhythm, with most lines doing more than one job. At times, the prose veers toward purple, with stacked metaphors and repeated coinages (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”) that risk feeling ornamental rather than necessary. Still, clarity is maintained, there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts, and the final images land cleanly. Tightening some modifiers and allowing more plainspoken contrast would push this into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some strong images (starlight refracting through dimensional tears, sand flowing both upward and downward). There is a tendency toward mild purple prose and repetition of conceptual phrases (“between realities,” “parallel timelines,” “interconnected patterns”) without adding new pressure. A few similes feel familiar or ornamental rather than sharpening the moment, and some sentences could be tightened for concision. Line-level craft is competent and occasionally vivid, but not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean yet evocative, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character, with few redundancies or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically aligned (weaving, looms, nets, threads) rather than random ornament. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and syntax remains clear even in more abstract moments. A few phrases verge on abstraction or repetition (“unsettling calm,” “texture of connection”), but they don’t materially obscure or slow the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally well-paced, with some graceful images (“unfolded horizons,” “waves that had become humanity’s shield and cage”). There is mild redundancy in explaining the Council, transmissions, and Elias’s curiosity, and a tendency toward abstract phrasing where concrete embodiment would sharpen impact. The unusual coinage “balancedly curious” reads slightly awkward and draws attention to itself. Overall, lines carry information efficiently but rarely surprise at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is generally clean: grammar is solid, sequencing is clear, and most sentences pull their weight. There is some redundancy (“persistently curious nature,” repeated thematic formulations) and occasional abstraction (“incidental heroism,” “protect vulnerable voices”) where concrete image could do the job. The prose edges toward purple in places but never quite tips into muddle; it remains legible if somewhat over-explanatory. Overall, it’s competent and smooth but short of the compression and precision expected in top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with good information density and several striking images, and most sentences do more than one job. However, the piece leans toward purple in places, with stacked modifiers and conceptual metaphors (“water that seemed somehow thicker than it should be,” “quantum ghosts,” “weighed nothing and everything”) that sometimes blur more than sharpen. There are minor artifacts (the stray Chinese character, some near-repetitions of “crushing hush”/“crushing pressure”) that slightly dull momentum. Sentence rhythms are varied enough, but the overall texture could benefit from a few cleaner, plainer lines to offset the high lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally smooth and readable, with clear sentences and a good sense of visual rhythm; it carries atmosphere efficiently. At the same time, there’s a tendency toward purple or familiar metaphors (“whispered its approval,” “captured dawn in the moonlight”) and thematic repetition that doesn’t always add new information or pressure. A few lines paraphrase the same idea—survival, wisdom from failure, midnight solace—in slightly different words, which creates minor redundancy. These issues don’t break clarity but do dull the sharpness expected at the most demanding publications.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, imagery is coherent, and much of the language does double duty (worldbuilding + theme). Figurative density is high but mostly controlled, and there’s minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn. A few phrases repeat or edge toward purple (“translate texture into sound,” “across the death of this language”), and some abstract formulations could be sharpened into more concrete moments. Still, momentum and clarity remain intact, and the final image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious redundancy, and the rhythm varies in a way that supports mood. Figurative language is inventive and mostly coherent with the world’s surreal logic. There is some density of abstraction and repeated motif-phrases (“harmony untamed,” “cosmic joke”) that edge toward overstatement but do not seriously impede clarity or momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final paragraph closes on a charged, memorable image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly tight, vivid, and multi-tasking, and the piece reads smoothly aloud with good momentum for a lyric story. There is some repetition (“resonantly soft” appears several times, and a few “she had” constructions stack), and occasional purple edging, but it rarely muddies clarity or pace. Figurative language is generally coherent and grounded in the story’s imagery rather than feeling random. With a light pass to trim redundancies and vary a few recurring phrases, this would be elite-level prose.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, varied, and information-dense, and key images (neon ghosts, storm in a bottle, shimmering drone web) are memorable. There is a mild tendency toward purple prose and stacked metaphor (“neon ghosts flickering in their glass coffins,” “brittle hush”) that occasionally risks calling attention to itself rather than the moment. Nonetheless, momentum is preserved, transitions are clean, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. The final paragraph lands with a precise, earned image rather than a blur of figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a good ratio of concrete to evocative language, keeping momentum through description-heavy passages. Some phrasing is slightly redundant or leans into abstract, “poetic” formulations (“language of light and shadow, of possibility and silence”; repeated “misting hush”) that don’t always add new information. The figurative language mostly holds together but occasionally feels a touch purple or generic, which dampens impact in peak beats. Line-level craft is solidly above average but not yet razor-honed for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. However, figurative density is high and occasionally verges on redundancy (multiple restatements of stories “living” and analog memories “breathing”), which slightly blunts momentum. Small artifacts—“librarianadjusted” (missing space), inline non-English characters that feel more glitch than purposeful—jar the surface in an otherwise polished piece. Overall craft is strong but not yet at elite, line-perfect level.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally polished: sentences are grammatical, imagery is vivid, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. There is some density of figurative language and repetition (“luminous absence,” “improbable beginnings,” multiple sentences explaining the dream’s role) that edges into overwriting and redundancy. Nonetheless, clarity remains intact, and most sentences pull both atmospheric and conceptual weight. Trimming a few explanatory or near-duplicate lines would sharpen momentum considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept ("fragments of forgotten things drifted like cosmic dust"). However, there is a tendency toward density and repetition of cosmic imagery that edges into purple—multiple uses of "cosmic," "nexus," and elaborate metaphors in close succession. Despite this, clarity holds and the climax is easy to follow, with no major syntactic or logical muddles. Some tightening of modifiers and figurative language would sharpen impact without sacrificing music.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“glass structure catching morning light in fractured patterns,” “light, bent and folded into impossible shapes”) and generally good information density. There are a few slightly purple or summarizing lines that explain what the images already suggest, particularly around theme (“Decades later—this phrase underestimates how time folds itself in places like this…”), but they don’t seriously drag momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean; there’s no major looping or metaphor muddle, and most sentences do more than one job. Trimming a handful of abstracted or restating phrases would yield an even sharper line-level profile.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and largely economical for its lyricism; most sentences carry multiple functions (world-building plus emotion, image plus theme). Recurrent images like the playground-swing hush and the fading shadow avoid muddle and frame the piece musically. There is some risk of mild purple prose and conceptual repetition in the final paragraphs, but it doesn’t significantly stall momentum or obscure sense. Line-level control is strong enough for near-publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often lovely and multi-sensory, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. However, there is a tendency toward overpacked sentences and modifier stacks (“mist and sunlight danced in a radiant hush,” “the scent of petrichor and the cool taste of morning dew”) that verge on purple and slightly slow momentum. Phrasal repetitions (“radiant hush,” “color of wonder”) and the visible bracketed word-count markers are minor artifacts that disrupt flow. Clarity of action and image remains intact, but a leaner line would better suit elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are rhythmic, images are vivid, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and motion). There is some over-dense figurative language and a few clunky or redundant constructions (“across sharing this secret, across hours…”, “interlaced hush upon hush”) that feel purple rather than precise. Still, clarity and momentum are rarely compromised, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts. Tightening about 10–15% of modifiers and thematic restatements would markedly elevate the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and concept. A few phrases verge on repetition or mild purple (“where a map tears” appears multiple times; “spaces between what we claim to know” flirts with abstraction), but they don’t seriously obscure meaning or dull the ending. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn, and the prose largely sustains momentum through image and action. Not quite in the rarefied, razor-precise tier, but comfortably above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and often striking (“the weight of a thousand unspoken goodbyes,” “a sound like silk tearing”), with good sentence-level rhythm and no major clarity issues. Most lines do double duty, advancing atmosphere and character together, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A few metaphors and abstractions verge on the purple or overly general (e.g., “There’s a beauty in it, don’t you think?”) but they don’t seriously impede momentum. Overall, the language is strong and publication-ready with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level work is generally strong: images are clear, sentences mostly carry multiple functions (world-building plus mood or character), and grammar and sequencing are sound. There is some repetition (“weathered features” and “weathered hands,” several near-synonymous articulations of his purpose) and a tendency toward adjective stacking that edges into mild purple prose without tipping into incoherence. Momentum holds; even reflective sentences usually tie back to current action or stakes. A bit more pruning of redundant phrasing and over-explanation would sharpen an already solid stylistic performance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clear, grammatical, and well-paced, with a good balance of description and progression. There is some repetition of key phrases and concepts (“joy beneath anguish,” “unfolded,” explanatory statements of motive) that leans toward mild redundancy but doesn’t seriously drag momentum. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, and the final image is clean if slightly over-explained. Line-level craft is solid but not strikingly compressed or multi-layered.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is imaginative and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and theme. Syntax is mostly clear and varied, and there are few outright confusions or redundancies. However, figurative language is dense and occasionally repetitive (“quietly explosive,” “spooled wholeness,” multiple wound/skin/void metaphors), creating a mild purple-prose feel and some sense of the same insight being restated. Trimming a few abstractions and letting concrete images carry more weight would sharpen momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: many sentences do double duty, sensory detail is precise, and rhythm is varied enough to keep momentum. Some phrases and structures recur (“fractally precise,” “his hands…,” “the sky remained”), and the last section leans on summarizing epithets instead of fresh concrete action, flirting with purple prose. Still, clarity and forward motion are never truly obscured, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong rhythmic control in long, flowing sentences that match the meditative tone. Information density is good: most lines carry setting, concept, and character at once. There is mild overwriting and repetition in the final third (e.g., list-like clauses: “The starlings had shown him the way, the hopscotch board had preserved the knowledge, the phrasebook had unlocked the language...”), and some abstractions could be tightened. Still, clarity never collapses, and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences have good musicality, images are vivid, and most lines do more than one job. There is some purple drift and occasional redundancy (the central phrases and a few sensory motifs recur without always adding new nuance). Figurative language remains legible and thematically aligned, and syntax varies enough to keep rhythm from going monotonous. Tightening a few repeated formulations would sharpen momentum and avoid the sense of ornament piling up.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically sound, and free of major artifacts or muddled metaphors. Sentences often carry multiple pieces of information efficiently, and there is little outright padding or looped repetition. At times the language drifts into summary and abstraction (“orchestrate a collective effort,” “interconnectedness”) that dulls immediacy and textural vividness. While solidly crafted, the line-level work does not quite achieve the density, rhythmic control, or idiosyncrasy expected in elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid images (“paint peeling like ancient parchment”; “measured reality as if it were a breath to be exhaled”) and good information density. However, the prose leans into repetition and purple intensifiers—“bruised awe,” “a thousand lifetimes,” “nested patterns,” and “pane of hush” recur in ways that sometimes feel like paraphrase loops rather than fresh turns. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent; it occasionally slows momentum by restating already-established emotional stakes. The closing image lands clearly despite this, so the main cost is mild drag rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with images like the mechanical birds’ razor wings and the blue thread-path doing multiple jobs. There are occasional purple or slightly muddled moments (“morning sickness” metaphor; the unexplained Chinese insertions “清晰的” and “晶体者”) that feel more like glitches than purposeful stylistic choices. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and momentum is maintained through the build-activate-chase sequence. Line-level craft is solid but not immaculate enough for top-tier scores.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally graceful, with well-chosen metaphors that braid scientific, musical, and natural images into a cohesive texture. Sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain flow, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some repetition of motifs and slightly abstract formulations (“molecular arrangements of possibility,” “translate separation into connection”) that could be tightened. Still, there’s no serious overwriting or looping that harms clarity or momentum, and the final sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished and clear, with strong sensory images and few outright clunkers. Some redundancy and slight purple-leaning moments—e.g., “bottles of bottled moonlight” and repeated metaphor templates (“fragmented like the daylight,” “fragmented like the clouds”)—dull the impact. Syntax and paragraphing are varied enough, but certain phrases and constructions recur in a way that feels like stylistic scaffolding rather than deliberate pattern. Information density is good, though a tighter, less repetitive treatment of key metaphors would heighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with high information density and few redundancies. Metaphors like “brittle fractures spreading through its ancient mortar, much like his own facade” are apt and coherent, and figurative language generally serves both mood and characterization. There is a lot of imagery, but it rarely tips into muddle or mixed metaphors, and momentum is preserved. Minor tightening could prune a small number of near-synonymous phrases, but there are no significant artifacts or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong—rhythmically varied, image-rich, and economical given the conceptual density. Phrases like “construct bridges from silos” and “under the hush of borrowed starlight” are striking and thematically cohesive rather than mere ornament. There is some redundancy and summarizing in the latter third (lists of outcomes, repeated labels like “harmonious choral librarian” and “vigorous tender”) that slightly blunts momentum and immediacy. Still, clarity remains high and there are no major figurative misfires or clutter that obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally fluent and often striking, with some memorable metaphors and rhythmic variety. That said, it leans toward density and repetition—key phrases and constructions recur (“through synaptic plasticity,” “abandoned dreams,” “quaking reverie”) in ways that occasionally feel like paraphrase loops rather than escalation. A tendency to pile abstractions and technical terms together sometimes blurs rather than sharpens the image. Line-level control is solid but not yet ruthlessly pared or precise enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. There is some tendency toward abstraction and purple-ish turns (“latent blaze of purpose,” “air grew thick with potential,” “architecture of reality recalibrate”), but these rarely obscure sense or stall momentum. Repetition and scaffolding are minimal; the piece moves efficiently from beat to beat. Sharpening a few high-level phrases into more concrete, embodied images would improve line-level vividness without sacrificing style.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose shows strong rhythm and metaphorical control, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Repetitions (e.g., several sentences reiterating the grove’s quiet and Eliara’s empathy) stay just shy of feeling like loops and instead read as deliberate motif. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and grounded, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. A few phrases feel slightly overwrought or redundant, but they don’t materially obscure action or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally smooth and readable, with solid rhythm and some strong images (lavender and charcoal twilight, the stone warming, the dent as map). At times, figurative and abstract language stacks (“discover beauty in the difficult circumstances,” “translating silence into wisdom”) and creates a faint whiff of purple or redundancy. Information density is decent, but several sentences paraphrase earlier ideas about exile, covenant, and silence without adding new pressure. Line-level craft is good but could be tightened to reduce repetition and abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally fluent, image-rich, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and characterization. Some phrases recur (“theatrical yet sincere,” “manufactured thunder”) and a few abstractions (e.g., “feelings that survive where language expires”) verge on purple without adding new pressure. Nonetheless, clarity is never lost, and the figurative language is mostly coherent and thematically aligned with sound and silence. Trimming a handful of overtly conceptual lines would sharpen momentum and elevate the piece to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and generally efficient, with many lines doing double duty for setting and theme (e.g., “homes built on sturdy branch foundations that had died to provide new life”). Sensory specificity, especially olfactory, is vivid without tipping into incoherence. At times the diction skirts purple and repeats certain abstractions (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “serenity”) rather than always grounding them in fresh image, but this doesn’t seriously damage momentum or clarity. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive markets, though a slight tightening of thematic statements would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and often evocative (“in the whirling silence that only this hour on the planet Xylos could bring,” “in rhythm with the echoes, a testament to survival written in stolen energy”). Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and information density is good. There is some redundancy and mild purple edging—reiterations of “whirling silence,” “resilience,” and explicit lesson talk that could be trimmed for sharper impact. Still, nothing at the line level seriously obscures clarity or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and controlled, with good rhythmic variety and strong image density; lines often pull double duty for mood and information. At times, modifiers stack into mild purple (“unexplained, unresolved, unprecedented”; “deliberate, devastating in its application and precise in its execution”), and a few near-redundant formulations could be tightened. Still, no major loops or figurative muddles impede momentum or closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains many striking images and some effective syntheses of color and sound, and clarity of action is maintained despite the lyricism. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, with repeated metaphor families (“sculpted hush,” “marrow of existence,” “tapestry of hues and melodies”) that edge into purple and redundancy. Trimming loops and letting a few key images breathe would substantially sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally smooth and evocative, with strong images (driftwood as bones, reality fraying like tapestry) and mostly clean syntax. However, modifiers and metaphors are frequent and sometimes stack (“avalanchingly quiet,” “wounded spirits,” “space where consequences lived”), creating a mild sense of overrichness and conceptual repetition. A few lines summarize inner states or realizations where image could carry more weight, slightly dragging momentum. Line-level craft is solid but not razor-honed; tightening and pruning would be needed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is generally strong: images like the halo fragment fracturing light into “impossible geometries” or prints scattered “like fallen constellations” are vivid and apt. Sentences are information-dense without much scaffolding or redundancy, and there’s effective multi-tasking of description, worldbuilding, and interiority. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically coherent (stars/constellations/geometry/emotion); it rarely feels purple or muddled. Trimming a couple of conceptual restatements (“mathematics of emotion” appears several times with similar framing) could sharpen momentum even further.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, rich but mostly controlled imagery, and clear sequencing. There is some mild redundancy and a tendency to lean on the same metaphor cluster (“seeds,” “germinate,” “bloom into the extraordinary”), which edges toward thematic overstatement. A few phrases flirt with purple (“colors that hadn’t existed since the earliest myths”), but they don’t obscure sense or causality. Overall, the prose is polished and fluid, if occasionally more ornamental than strictly necessary for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, interiority, and action), and the rhythm supports the meditative pressure. Imagery like “windshield perfectly fanned with fern-like ice” and “battlefield of yesterday’s peace” is vivid without overextension. There is some repetition of key conceptual phrases (“truthful lies,” “shifted hush,” restated proof) and occasional abstraction that could be tightened for maximum impact. Overall, the prose is polished and publishable, if a touch luxuriant for the modest on-page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and readable, with few if any grammatical or clarity issues and some striking images. Nonetheless, the prose shows noticeable redundancy and formulaic repetition (“the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry,” “raveling silence,” reiterating the same stakes) that slightly drags momentum. Figurative density sometimes approaches purple, with modifiers like “stoically sparkling” feeling ornamental rather than doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong—rhythmically varied, clear, and visually vivid, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. However, there is a tendency toward purple density and reiteration: key phrases and abstract pairings (“understanding and confusion,” “azure defiance,” “bartered awakenings”) recur enough to feel slightly overinsisted. A few sentences summarize emotional states or process (“Hours passed, the time between understanding and confusion stretching…”) where a sharper image could carry the same work. Despite this, momentum remains intact and the final images are legible and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich imagery and a good sense of rhythm; many sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character simultaneously). However, figurative language is very dense—“chaotic symphony,” “murmur of half-remembered dreams,” “tear in reality’s fabric,” etc.—and occasionally veers toward purple, slightly slowing momentum. Some abstractions and near-redundancies in the closing paragraphs could be trimmed without loss, which would sharpen impact. Clarity remains intact, but a lighter touch would better serve the story at key pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms, strong sensory images, and generally good information density—most lines carry both scene and emotion. Motifs (light, sea, stones, letters) are woven without obvious scaffolding, and there are few if any genuine clarity issues. That said, there are pockets of near-redundancy and slight purple drift, especially in the final third where “safety,” “fragile solace,” and similar abstractions are reiterated instead of letting the concrete images stand. A touch of tightening and pruning of repeated thematic phrasing would lift this to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm is varied, and most metaphors align with the story’s light/shadow lexicon. There is some repetition of concepts (“ancient shadows,” “otherworldly routine,” prophecy) and occasional purple-ish phrasing, but it rarely muddies meaning or stalls momentum. Information density is good, with very little true scaffold or synonym-churn.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is controlled and efficient: most lines carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess; repetition of key phrases (“sun trails,” “iridescent”) reads as deliberate patterning. There are no obvious scaffold or synonym loops, and the pivotal illumination scene is clear and vivid. A tiny amount of abstraction in the explanatory sentences slightly softens the line-level edge but doesn’t harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and controlled: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and concept simultaneously). Figurative language is consistent and disciplined, leaning into the scientific-mystical lexicon (liquid light, golden threads) without tipping into purple prose. There are no significant loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues, and the closure image is sharp. The prose is polished but not yet dazzling enough in rhythm or surprise to justify a higher elite-venue score.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with good rhythm and information density; many sentences carry setting, mood, and thematic work simultaneously. However, figurative language leans heavy and somewhat repetitive, especially around weaving/stitching and light as dawn, flirting with purple prose. Despite that, clarity remains intact and closure imagery is not muddled. Trimming a few redundant metaphors and tightening some modifiers would elevate it to a more publish-ready polish.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely polished, rhythmically varied, and generally economical, with several strong lines and images (“a woman enlarged by tranquility gained through necessary surrender”). Information density is good: most sentences carry both atmosphere and character. There is some repetition in diction and concepts (“nested/nestled paradoxes,” “tranquility,” “compassion”) and a mild tendency toward abstract phrasing that softens immediacy. Nonetheless, momentum holds and clarity is never in doubt, keeping line-level issues from materially harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and evocative metaphors (bread crust as “a perfect map of forgotten streets,” seeds as “tiny prayers”) that do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies well across longer reflective sentences and shorter, beat-focused lines, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. At times the lyricism stacks slightly—several metaphors and abstractions in close proximity—which risks softening sharpness of individual images. Nonetheless, clarity and forward momentum are preserved, and the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, grammatically clean, and rich in image; many sentences carry atmosphere and concept simultaneously. There is a tendency toward purple repetition—“quartz hush,” “crystalline,” “gently meticulous nature,” and variants on fading luminosity recur without always adding new nuance. Line-level momentum is steady but a bit uniform; fewer modifiers and slightly more syntactic variation would sharpen impact. Still, no major artifacts or confusions obscure meaning, and the final image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, syntactically varied, and free of obvious grammatical errors, with good information density for the word count. There is some redundancy and mild purple-prose tendency (e.g., “threatening words that echoed like distant thunder in the confined space,” “comforting unease”), but it doesn’t obscure meaning. Key actions (pressing the fob, slipping behind the tent, the sunrise beam) are presented cleanly and in logical sequence. Tighter trimming of repeated ideas and a slightly leaner metaphor palette under high pressure would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is strong, with vivid metaphors (“fingerprints feel like rain,” “roots clicking in dactylic rhythms”) and good sensory layering; most sentences do more than one job. Rhythm and paragraphing are varied enough to sustain momentum in a lyric mode. That said, figurative density is high and occasionally flirts with purple—terms like “terrestrially cosmic” and repeated invocations of “convergence” and “weather-carriers” can feel thesis-driven rather than strictly necessary. Still, line-level clarity holds, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose flows smoothly at the sentence level and maintains momentum, with few outright clumsy constructions. However, metaphor density is high and occasionally redundant (“tears frozen in time,” “simmered beneath the surface like molten lava,” “weight of unspoken truths”), resulting in purple overtones and some conceptual repetition. Several sentences paraphrase the same interior turns in slightly different language, especially near the end, which blunts impact. Tightening figurative language and cutting repeated abstractions would sharpen the piece considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that are internally consistent with the world (leaves, light, dust, water). The prose often does double duty, advancing plot and theme simultaneously (the wilting skin patterns under bureaucratic euphemisms, the zinc plate “bearing faint impressions of words never delivered”). There is minor repetition of ideas in the explanatory middle, but not enough to materially drag momentum. Overall, rhythm and clarity support rather than compete with the story’s emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains many strong lines and images, and most sentences do double duty for mood and worldbuilding. At the same time, there is noticeable redundancy (re-explaining the same concepts of truth/symphony/wonder), occasional purple-leaning abstractions, and a few typos (“a open-air,” “butfelt,” repeated “glisten-ing”) that break the spell at this standard. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it just isn’t always as compressed or selective as a top-tier venue would demand. Trimming repeated ideas and tightening phrasing would significantly raise the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense; many lines multitask by advancing setting, mood, and theme at once. Some phrasing trends toward repetition (“strangely organic” appears multiple times) and near-purple metaphor density, but it rarely obscures meaning. The prose sustains momentum without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the final images are clear. A touch more restraint in figurative language at peak beats would likely elevate readability further.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean and readable, with some vivid phrases and a generally smooth rhythm. Yet there is noticeable overwriting and repetition of certain metaphors and formulations (“treasures,” “unlocked,” “listening heals,” “mosaic,” “sandstorm calm”), which can feel on-the-nose. Several sentences paraphrase the same emotional beat (Elias’s purpose, the power of listening), and figurative language sometimes stacks rather than sharpens. Despite this, causality and images remain clear, so momentum is dented rather than broken.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with sensible syntax and reasonably efficient paragraphs that keep the scene moving. There is some effective compression—large systems (regime, satellites) are sketched in a line without bogging the action. However, the language often defaults to familiar formulations (“key to liberating,” “dance with danger and won,” “as calm and enduring as the sea”), and the descriptive patterning (spider web, dance) veers toward repetitious rather than deepening. A tighter line edit could cut redundancy and sharpen images to lift this to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally tight: sentences are clear, rhythm is varied, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious padding. Key images—salt crystals refracting lantern light like the coffee formations, coffee grounds “dancing” in shifting gravity—are fresh and legible. There is some mild repetition and a touch of purple around the thematic wrap-up, but no major loops, mixed metaphors, or filter-verb scaffolding. Momentum is maintained throughout despite the reflective, descriptive density.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains many striking images (“his mind a tranquil blaze—burning quietly, consuming doubt”) and mostly clean syntax, but it is also heavily saturated with modifiers and repeated figurative patterns. Phrases like “terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush,” and “tranquil blaze” recur enough to feel mannered rather than organically necessary. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about silence, mapping, and hush, which slightly drags momentum and dilutes individual lines. Overall clarity remains high, but selective cutting and diversification of imagery would markedly tighten and elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, mostly tight, and carries multiple jobs per sentence—worldbuilding, mood, and character often coexist without redundancy. Images like “walls softening like old men recounting tales” and the seal’s warmth are vivid without descending into purple. There is some mild abstraction and a few lines that tell thematic content outright, slightly dulling momentum and subtlety, but no major loops or muddled metaphors. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only minor tightening desirable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: rhythms vary, paragraphs are well-shaped, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and story. Descriptive language is often striking and coherent, and there is little true scaffolding or repetition. That said, modifiers and metaphors accumulate (“tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve,” “silk-textured leaves”) in ways that verge on purple, occasionally dulling impact instead of sharpening it. Tightening a few abstractions and trimming ornament would elevate momentum and clarity further.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong: sensuous yet not completely overgrown, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Key images (“memories surfaced like drowning bodies,” the blood-pricked seal) are memorable and apt. There is some repetition (“wisely endured” twice, overlapping statements of her plan and motive) and a tendency toward stacked modifiers and conceptual phrases that could be trimmed for tighter momentum. The lone clear artifact (“who Marvel consulted”) is noticeable but localized, not enough to derail closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, image-rich, and largely economical given its lyric mode; most sentences do double duty for mood and information. Metaphor density is high but coherent (sound/stone/web motifs) and rarely contradicts itself, and there’s little outright redundancy or scaffolding. Momentum holds despite reflective passages, and grammar and sequencing are clean. The main drag on a higher score is occasional purple excess and conceptual repetition that slightly blur edges rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with few wasted sentences. Some imagery borders on purple or repetitive (“borrowed from starlight itself,” “borrowed and returned”), but the metaphors cohere to the motif of light and ice. Exposition is efficiently handled, though a couple of sentences paraphrase similar content about her gift and method. Overall, the prose feels publication-ready with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and sensory-rich, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. At times, however, it veers into purple or redundant territory—e.g., repeated use of “scintillatingly somber” and long, abstract clauses (“scintillatingly somber giver of the moon path’s secret”) that blur rather than sharpen feeling. Some sentences could be tightened without loss, improving momentum and punch. Line-level craft is solid and publishable with trimming, but not yet razor-precise enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and mostly concise, with straightforward syntax that keeps events clear. There are a few mild redundancies and explanatory sentences, especially near the end where theme is restated rather than implied, but they don’t significantly obscure momentum. Imagery like the “impossible orchard” and the cracked diamond is strong without tipping into purple prose. Line-level work is solidly publishable midlist but lacks the compression and surprise one expects at a “prestige” tier.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is rich and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, mood, and theme. There is some purple-leaning repetition in the light/dark/dawn/shadow motif and occasional conceptual piling (“variant allegiance had split his heart into warring halves”), but clarity is maintained. Line-level economy could be improved by trimming redundant thematic statements near the end. Overall, sentence rhythm and precision are strong enough for competitive publication with modest tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line by line, the prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically aware, with some strong images and efficient exposition through compressed montage. However, there is a steady drift toward purple abstraction and paraphrase (“lonesome splendor,” “music of time,” “geography of memory”) that occasionally substitutes atmosphere words for concrete new information. Several ideas are reiterated in slightly different language (his purpose, redemption, jars as vessels), which introduces mild redundancy. The closure image is still clear, but the density of figurative language in the final third slightly dulls its sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose shows control and some strong images (the key’s hum spreading through the ice, the marina as “cathedral of ice”), and sentences generally flow. Yet there is noticeable purple tendency: stacked modifiers, repeated conceptual words (vibration, resonance, absolution), and metaphoric density that occasionally blurs impact. Several adjacent sentences restate similar ideas about alignment, protection, and harmony, which slightly drags momentum and dilutes peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clear, fluid, and information-dense; most sentences advance both atmosphere and concept without padding. Imagery like “restrained wildness of growing roots breaking through stone” is strong and apt, and figurative language doesn’t usually tangle. There are some mild repetitions and explanatory lines that tell what’s already clear, but they don’t seriously drag momentum. No major artifacts or purple excesses mar the closure beat, though a slight tightening could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with good rhythm and some efficient integration of description and thought. There is noticeable repetition and occasional purple leaning—multiple mentions of the lantern “reverberating” or “wavered,” and abstractions that echo the same idea (“watchful calm,” “mask,” “armor”) without adding new pressure. Figurative language is generally coherent but somewhat dense for the modest level of on-page action. The line-level work is solid but could be pared and sharpened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence structures, vivid but controlled imagery, and efficient integration of description with action. There are minor redundancies and slight purple edges (e.g., “moved with an aptly deliberate pace, each motion slow and deliberate”) that could be trimmed for tautness. Most sentences do double duty—advancing plot while deepening mood—without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. The prose supports momentum and clarity, even in explanatory passages, though a touch more austerity at peak beats would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is lush and imaginative, with strong image-making and high information density, but it verges on purple and repetitive in places (e.g., reiterating “steadily curious” and “throughout the evolution” motifs). Several sentences are long and clause-heavy in ways that slightly blur emphasis and sap momentum, especially during what should be peak beats (the transliteration and map reveal). There’s mild paraphrase/summary (“Throughout the evolution of mechanical sentience, no creation had been so steadfastly curious…”) that restates what we already know. Overall craft is solid, but tighter line work and more varied sentence rhythm would elevate it to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally concise, with good information density and varied sentence rhythm; most lines do at least two jobs (world-building plus characterization, or exposition plus mood). Metaphors like “ghost in the machine” and “jagged scar in the network’s official timeline” are apt and not overstacked, avoiding purple excess. There are no evident loops or scaffolding artifacts, and syntax remains clear even when concepts are abstract. It’s polished, if not yet startlingly original at the line-by-line level.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful—“trees bearing crystalline fruit,” “shadow-stitched silk,” and “weighted breath” create a dense, evocative texture. Most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme), and grammar and sequencing are clean. However, the figurative density is high in nearly every line, edging toward purple and occasionally blurring urgency; there’s little sparseness where pressure should tighten. Some phrases repeat conceptually (empathy, balance, accumulation) without new angles, creating a mild redundancy drag.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, characterization) and the rhythm varies in a way that supports the reflective mode. Metaphors like “world suddenly thinner, as if he could see the seams where reality was poorly stitched” are vivid and apt, and most figurative language remains coherent and non-redundant. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym loops; exposition is compact and purposeful. A few capitalized or emphasized abstractions (“Understanding”) and stacked conceptual phrases edge toward mild overstatement but don’t materially drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally smooth, with clear syntax and a good amount of concrete image work (dust motes, charred paper, twisting tendril). There is some repetition of ideas and a tendency toward familiar lyric formulations (“hummed with the weight of unspoken truths,” “contemplative hush”), but not to the point of real opacity or drag. Sentences occasionally run long and could be tightened, yet momentum remains serviceable for a quiet piece. Line-level craft is solid but not exceptional, with a bit of purple edging that keeps it out of the very high band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and clear; images like “whispers…like a tempest of forgotten voices” and the cracked mask gleaming “like a crescent moon” are strong and legible. However, there is noticeable repetition and mild purple drift—“echo of wisdom,” “consecrate,” “whispers,” and pavilion descriptors recur without always adding new pressure or nuance. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas (e.g., reiterating the purpose of consecration and preservation) which slightly slow momentum. Still, line-level craft is above average and well within professional range, just shy of the ruthless compression top venues favor.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, sensorily rich, and mostly efficient—many sentences do double duty for character and atmosphere. However, figurative language is dense (“secret he carried like a moth in a jar,” “mind a loom,” “lavender field…thickening into a benediction,” “heart thrumming a rhythm of earnest whimsy”), edging into purple at moments and slightly blurring impact. There are no significant loops or clarity issues, but a touch more spareness around peak beats would strengthen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and musical, with varied sentence structures and strong information density; many lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Some wording edges toward purple (“a tiny cloud in a world where words had finally ceased their proliferation”) and there are occasional near-redundancies around silence and stillness, but they don’t significantly impede momentum. Figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned (sounds as “symphony,” crystal as “heart”), avoiding mixed metaphors. A slight tightening of modifiers and repeated abstractions would elevate it to top-tier line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with few if any redundant scaffolding sentences, and each line generally pulls double duty for mood and character. Metaphors like the eroding sandbar, unwatched videotapes as husks, and car hoods as ancient stones are coherent and reinforce one another. There is a high density of figurative language that occasionally approaches purple, but it remains legible and largely avoids muddle or mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum through a mostly interior, static scenario.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with good sentence variety and clear sequencing; almost every line advances atmosphere or situation. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and textures (“luminous ache,” “fragile,” “fleeting moments”) and an accumulation of abstractions that verge on purple. Some sentences paraphrase the same emotional idea in slightly different words, adding a faint sense of redundancy. None of this obscures causality, but it does slightly dull impact and keep the piece just short of truly razor-sharp line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clear and readable, with some strong images (the shard’s grooves under dim light, the clouds blushing pink). However, there is a tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing—“scent of hope” is leaned on heavily, and lines like “farewell orchestrated with care” and “methodically, he began hymning the mundane” feel self-conscious. Most sentences do at least two jobs, but some scaffolding and sentimentality could be pared back for greater sharpness and impact. Line-level craft is solid but not at a top-tier literary level yet.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with most sentences carrying at least two functions (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). Imagery—“shattered glass” constellations, “liquid smoke,” and “pure, unfiltered recognition”—is vivid without sliding into purple or confusion. There are minor repetitions (e.g., “quietly deliberate,” reiterations of “loops”) but they read motif-like rather than as scaffolding. A touch more pruning of slightly expository lines (“Her work was far from over”) could sharpen the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, and most images (e.g., “Manacles of starlight,” leaves that crystallize before touching the ground) feel fresh and grounded in the world’s logic. There is minimal redundancy and almost no scaffolding. A few abstract or slightly slogan-like phrases around “mistakes” and “constellations” soften the edge of the prose near the end, but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Overall, the piece reads as carefully revised and nearly publication-ready at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms, dense imagery, and good integration of setting, interiority, and action. However, figurative language is heavy and sometimes repetitive (“zephyr bloom,” “serpentine,” “pearl of stillness” recur with limited incremental nuance), edging into overwriting. A few lines restate similar ideas about transformation and light without adding pressure, which slightly dulls momentum. These issues don’t break clarity or closure but keep the line-level craft just below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and images that do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) without derailing clarity. However, there are several stacked metaphors and lush constructions (“honeyed hush that fell like golden syrup,” “synthetic animals returned to organic form”) that edge toward purple and could be pared back for sharper impact. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and there is little scaffolding or repetition to slow momentum. Line-level control is good enough for publication, but at this standard a slight over-ornamentation keeps it just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong sensory and conceptual density; lines frequently do multiple jobs (setting, mood, and theme at once). That said, there is a clear tendency toward purple texture—stacked metaphors and repeated coinages like “swirling hush” and “inside the whisper of closing pages”—that risk slight bloat and self-consciousness. Information flow remains clear despite this, and there are few truly redundant scaffolding sentences. Tightening some abstractions and trimming a handful of ornate phrases would bring the language closer to elite-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose contains many strong, image-rich lines (e.g., moonlight “weaving through the leaves like threads of destiny”), and the language is generally clear. However, modifiers and similes are frequent enough that they occasionally feel purple and slightly redundant, as with repeated invocations of hush, golden stories, and vines threading. A tighter line edit could cut some paraphrase and intensifiers without losing the lyric effect. Momentum is adequate but not razor-sharp, which matters at elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is mostly tight and purposeful, with strong verbs and concrete images (“spread across the copper surface like something both alive and sentient”) doing multiple jobs at once. There is some repetition of concepts (patience, discarded objects, resonance) but it tends to deepen rather than simply restate, and there’s little in the way of scaffold phrases or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors stay within the established logic of light, maps, and alchemy. The prose sustains momentum given the meditative mode, though the uniform lyric register risks slight monotony over longer work.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme) at once. Figurative language (e.g., “glowed with captured aurora”) is mostly apt and not over-stacked. There is mild conceptual redundancy around wonder, memory, and wounded season that could be tightened for maximum impact. Overall, the prose is polished and readable, just shy of the knife-edge precision expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is lush and often beautiful; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and world-building. However, metaphor density is high, with occasional strain or near-muddling (“whalebone reverie” for a bronze grotto, “thin skin of reality”), and some descriptive loops reduce momentum. A bit of pruning—especially of repeated motifs and multi-adjective constructions—would sharpen impact without losing the lyricism. As is, the prose is strong but at times veers toward purple, which would give a top-tier editor pause.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing atmospheric, thematic, and character work simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent, with only minor risk of excess in repeated abstractions like “crystallized time” and “harvested lessons from grief.” There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every line moves either image or insight forward. A slightly heavy thematic register in the closing paragraph keeps it shy of the very top band but doesn’t obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally fluid, with strong imagery and a clear rhythmic sensibility that supports the meditative tone. Sentences often do double duty—developing setting and interiority together—without glaring grammatical or syntactic issues. There is some paraphrase looping and mild purple-leaning abstraction, especially near the end where similar ideas about freedom, beginnings, and dance recur without adding new nuance. These repetitions slightly blunt momentum and impact but do not seriously obscure meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, rhythmic, and image-rich; sentences often carry setting, mood, and character at once (e.g., “releasing a trickle of water that smelled of rust and memory”). There is some repetition of key abstractions (“maze of intentions,” “equations for hope,” “stoic wonder”) and a tendency toward stacked metaphors that skirt the edge of purple but don’t collapse clarity. Momentum holds reasonably well for a lyric piece, though a few lines rephrase the same insight about hope and renewal. Overall line-level control is above average and publishable with tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong sensory images and mostly clean syntax. However, certain phrases and constructions recur (“excruciatingly gently,” “glacial hush,” long noun-phrase titles like “introverted clock scribe”) in ways that feel slightly redundant and self-conscious. Some lines tell the emotional takeaway rather than letting the existing images carry it, softening the impact. Rhythm and clarity stay intact, but a bit of trimming and variation would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically controlled, and dense with information (“a serene upheaval, a quiet and violent dismantling of his own life’s work”). Figurative language is mostly precise and thematically aligned, with minimal purple excess. There are a few near-redundant conceptual phrases (“architecture of lies,” “source code of the deception”) that echo each other without adding new pressure, but they don’t seriously impede momentum. Overall, the prose carries both atmosphere and narrative clearly and would need only light pruning for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—many sentences do double duty as atmosphere and character insight. Metaphors like “lightning’s frozen scream” and “fog rolling across the harbor, thick as breath after a long silence” are striking and mostly coherent with the story’s imagery. There is a mild tendency toward over-ornamentation—almost every beat carries figurative language—but it doesn’t seriously obscure sense or momentum in this calm scene. Line-level redundancy and scaffolding are minimal, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm from going flat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the copper signs, the carpet thread as weft of memory). There is little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping, and modifiers are generally precise rather than florid. The main weakness is a mild drift into abstract diction and aphoristic phrasing in a few places, which flattens immediacy compared to the story’s best concrete lines. Still, the prose would be competitive in many serious literary journals without much trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatical, vivid, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional texture. Recurrent images (egg, wires, stalactites, song) are clear and not muddled by mixed metaphors. There is some tendency toward purple repetition (“painfully sweet,” “beautiful again,” “quaking reverie”) and stacked figurative language, which risks slight saturation but does not seriously obscure meaning or momentum. A leaner pass trimming redundancies and a few intensifiers would lift this into truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often does multiple jobs at once—advancing image, mood, and theme in the same line. Metaphoric language is generally apt and coherent, and the read-aloud rhythm is varied enough to maintain momentum. There is some repetition of key motifs and formulations (“scars could sing,” “rebirth,” explicit thesis statements) that edges toward overwriting, especially in the final third. Still, clarity is never sacrificed, and no major scaffolding or loop artifacts bog down the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“He clutched a stained glass box, its colors muted…as if the secrets inside had long since given up trying to escape”). Rhythm varies well, and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy despite an image-rich style. However, figurative density is high—nearly every beat carries a metaphor—which risks dulling impact, and a few abstractions in the closing paragraphs (“sidereal patience…about becoming”) flatten what has been concretely earned. Line-level craft is strong and publishable, even if a light pruning would heighten potency.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with strong images (“blossoms of gas and light drifted like silent prayers,” “gear whirred on, approximating infinity”). Many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme, and momentum generally carries through without dead scaffolding. However, there are occasional slips into overwrought or redundant phrasing and a noticeable typo (“Canada edges”) that undercut polish for a top-tier market; a light tightening of modifiers and a pass for small errors would elevate it significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is musical and image-rich—“thundering calm,” “dormant serpent,” “cathedral of life and death”—with good variety in sentence length and structure. Most sentences perform multiple functions (setting, mood, character) and maintain momentum despite a contemplative mode. There is some mild purple tendency and thematic repetition, particularly in the latter third, that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, and the closing cadence is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally fluent and image-rich, with strong metaphors like time “holding its breath” and the clock’s “aging brass heart.” There is some purple layering and redundancy (“sacred covenant,” “beyond arcane,” repeated formulations of balance and absolution) that could be tightened for concision and impact. Sentences sometimes over-accumulate clauses, mildly slowing momentum in an already low-pressure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: syntax varies, images are concrete, and most lines carry more than one function (world-building, mood, and character simultaneously). However, metaphors and modifiers are dense (“velveteen gloom that clung…like memory itself”; “tendrils of colored thread crisscrossed the fabric, some vibrant as daylight, others fuzzy as dream fragments”), edging into purple and occasionally feeling layered rather than deepened. There are minor paraphrase tendencies (e.g., repeating the motivation in similar language) but not enough to seriously stall momentum or obscure causality. A modest tightening of figurative language would better match elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is solid and sometimes striking (“liquid starlight,” the lake as “tears of joy”), and syntax is clean. That said, metaphor density is high and often redundant, with repeated formulations (“his ignorance now a map,” the lake as mirror/canvas) and stacked abstractions that border on purple. Several sentences restate similar ideas about possibility, innovation, and mapping without adding new pressure. Momentum doesn’t collapse, but trimming and sharpening would significantly improve density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line by line, the story is competent to strong: grammar and sequencing are clear, and most sentences carry multiple functions (image + mood + information). There is noticeable metaphor and motif stacking around dust, embers, glow, mist, and memory, which occasionally tips into redundancy and softens impact. A few phrases rely on familiar turns (“as if the world held its breath”), and some sentences could be tightened without loss. These issues don’t obscure causality or closure, but they do slightly dilute sharpness and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally solid: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and most figurative language is apt and grounded in the story’s imagery. There are a few instances of overwriting and near-redundancy (repeated invocation of “mirage of safety,” somewhat expository assertions like “He had done it—he had captured the fleeting”), which slightly dull momentum and subtlety. The bracketed numerals (639], 717]) read as extraneous artifacts, though they don’t materially obscure the narrative. Overall, the prose is strong but would benefit from some trimming of declarative and decorative lines.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid phrases (“acrid air thickened,” “abrasive calm”) and sentences that usually carry multiple functions (world-building, character, theme). There is some tendency toward density and abstraction, especially in philosophy-laden lines, which can slightly slow momentum and distance the reader from immediate stakes. Redundancies around the idea of “competing narratives” and the state’s mythmaking creep in but don’t dominate. The prose is solidly above average yet could be tightened and de-academicized in places to approach elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-formed, rhythm varies, and several images (the rosette’s carved mathematics, the final chord hanging “like autumn amber”) are vivid. There is some conceptual redundancy around key motifs (“by subtracting noise,” restated stakes) and a tendency toward abstraction and stacked clauses that edge into purple territory. A few constructions are awkward or overpacked, which slightly dulls momentum and immediacy. Nonetheless, clarity holds throughout, and most sentences carry more than one layer of work.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, fluid, and information-dense, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or action plus theme). Imagery like the plant responding chromatically to her emotions and fruit as a miniature galaxy is vivid without tipping into purple. There are minor redundancies and a few lines that lean on abstract summary rather than concrete dramatization, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Grammar and sequencing are solid, and the closing sentences land with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, with good sentence variety and a strong ear; most lines do at least two jobs (world, mood, character). Occasional purple notes (“honeyed glow,” “nectar dusk’s soft lament”) flirt with overwriting but remain coherent and thematically apt. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic templates that drag momentum, and grammar/punctuation are clean. The main limitation, at an elite-venue standard, is that figurative language remains more conventionally pretty than surprising or cutting, especially at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, syntax is clean, and most metaphors land without muddle (“compressed magnitude of quiet…like auditory gold” is vivid and legible). The prose is dense with figuration but rarely redundant, and there are few if any obvious scaffolding phrases or synonym loops. At times the accumulation of personifications and abstractions edges toward purple, slightly softening momentum, but not enough to threaten clarity or the closure image. Information density and rhythm are high enough for near-immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty, advancing atmosphere and character while maintaining clarity, and the closing image is sharp and memorable. There is a high density of figurative language, but it is largely coherent and thematically keyed to fractures, animation, and depth rather than feeling random. A few phrases verge on purple (“torrent of revelations,” “phantom tide of thought”) and could be pared without loss, but they do not obscure causality or closure. Overall momentum is preserved despite the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is smooth and largely free of grammatical error, with a clear sequence of actions and images. That said, there is noticeable repetition of concepts (infinity, loop, texture of regret) and some purple or abstract phrasing that doesn’t always add new information. The final paragraphs, in particular, stack similar sentiments about freedom and lessons learned, which slightly blunts momentum and impact. Overall the prose is solid and functional, occasionally striking, but not yet as compressed or multi-tasking as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensory, and purposeful, and most do double duty in building atmosphere and character. Metaphors are generally controlled and apt, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. There is some purple tilt—multiple stacked images (“saffron quiet,” “syntax of lost languages,” “smog of indifference”) in close proximity—but they remain intelligible and do not obscure causality or the closure image. Tightening a few abstract phrases could further enhance propulsion without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is sensuous and information-dense—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character—without major clarity issues. There is some flirtation with purple (“honeyed sunlight,” “rosewater dread,” “communion of loss and determination”) and heavy metaphor density, but it remains mostly controlled and pattern-consistent. Rhythm varies; there are no significant loops or scaffold sentences dragging momentum. Minor tightening of modifiers and figurative layers in a few spots would sharpen impact further at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and imagistic, with strong rhythm and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “the sea retreated like a dying breath”). However, density of figurative language is high throughout, occasionally verging on purple and risking saturation rather than escalation. Some concepts are repeated in slightly different abstractions (fate/design, temporal chaos, neatly inventive ambition) where tightening would increase impact. Line-level control remains strong enough that closure is clear and powerful, but a rigorous edit could sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with vivid phrases like “lingering luminance still burning like a dying star” that both carry image and theme. Sentences vary in length, and paragraphs move the scene forward rather than looping. A few spots flirt with purple or redundant abstractions, but they do not significantly slow momentum or muddle the climax. Overall, information density and rhythm are strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and a distinctive sonic texture; many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. However, figurative language is very frequent, and phrases like “mathematics of the impossible” and “cosmic sonic origami” start to feel slightly stacked rather than escalatory. There’s some conceptual repetition of the core idea (obstacles→instruments, survival as music) that could be tightened to sharpen momentum. Despite a slight purple tint, clarity remains good and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid but controlled description, mostly lean exposition, and few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Sentences often carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without bloating, and the rhythm flexes appropriately between reflective and active beats. A few phrases (“instrument of truth,” “city drowning in denial”) skew more abstract and explanatory than the surrounding texture, slightly dulling the close. Overall, the prose is clean, precise, and publishable with only minor tightening for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and concise, with vivid images like the ivy “wrapped…like a forgotten promise” and the letter “like a trapped star.” Some metaphors and abstractions repeat (lies as prisons, decay as moral rot, beauty fading but consequences lingering), edging toward thematic redundancy. Line-level clarity is strong, and there are few, if any, syntactic or grammatical stumbles. Overall, the writing is competent and at times striking, but occasional overtness and familiar imagery keep it just short of elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (advancing action, revealing character, and charging theme simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, building a tight tonal weave. There are a few phrases that edge toward purple or redundant (e.g., “interlaced absence” plus several explanatory glosses of that idea), but they don’t materially drag momentum. With a light trim for repetition and an occasional overrich metaphor, this would be elite-level prose.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: clear syntax, minimal redundancy, and several striking images (“constellations in the darkness,” “dancing patterns across his notes”). There is some repetition of favored words and constructions (“dappled,” “tranquilly perceptive,” restating the library’s preservation) and a tendency to explain realizations after already implying them through action. Metaphors stay mostly coherent and on-theme, though the prose occasionally edges toward purple in reflective sentences. Momentum holds throughout, with no major scaffolding or loop artifacts dulling the climax or ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, richly imagistic, and generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (light, glass, stone, shadows), rarely feeling purple or mixed. There are occasional dense stretches where modifiers could be trimmed, yet momentum and clarity remain intact, including in the closing paragraph. No major artifacts, loops, or syntactic monotony undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-by-line, the prose is generally strong, with vivid imagery and varied syntax; several metaphors (orthogonal vector of his life, crystal mirroring screens) are apt and layered. There is mild density creep: many sentences carry stacked abstractions and figurative turns, which occasionally blur momentum and risk purple prose (“relay-sensitive hearts,” “theologian of the potential realm,” “anticipatory horror and ecstasy”). Nonetheless, clarity remains intact and there are few outright redundancies or loops. A light trim of the more decorative metaphors would sharpen impact without sacrificing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally fluid and readable, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and plot, and there are no major grammatical or clarity issues. That said, there is a tendency toward purple abstraction—stacked modifiers, repeated conceptual phrases (“frequency,” “belonging,” “brilliant dimness”)—that occasionally feel like paraphrase-loops rather than fresh progression. Concrete sensory detail sometimes yields to generalized grandeur (e.g., “emotional symphonies,” “instruction manual for belonging”), which blunts impact. Line-level craft is solid but could be tightened and sharpened for greater precision and force.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are controlled, and most metaphors (“sieved hush,” “frozen sea”) are fresh and apt. The repetition of weight/sea/filters forms a consistent imagistic system rather than random ornamentation. The density of figurative language is high but rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and there’s little in the way of scaffold or filler sentences. A slight pruning of overtly symbolic or restating lines could sharpen momentum further, but the prose is already near-publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are largely clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied, with some striking images (“furrowed hush,” “storm-worn windblown parapet in mist”). Yet there is a recurring tendency toward abstraction and repetition of concepts (“liminal space,” “between apology and forgiveness,” “recycling mistakes into wisdom”) that could be pared back. A few phrases border on purple or pseudo-philosophical without adding new pressure. Overall momentum survives, but tighter, more concrete phrasing would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is generally high: varied rhythms, purposeful images, and good information density with minimal scaffolding. Recurring metaphors (stars, currents, gravity) are coherent and thematically aligned, though phrases like “backlash of regret” and “expectations had collapsed like dying stars” verge on familiar or slightly purple. There’s mild repetition of certain conceptual moves but not enough to materially drag momentum. Overall polish is strong but not quite at the razor-sharp concision and surprise expected at the very top level.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, mood, interiority), and the piece maintains momentum despite a reflective tilt. A few phrases verge on purple or redundant (“clean slate seeker with a dirty past,” “kindle empathy”), and the density of figurative language is high, but it generally remains coherent and purposeful. There are no major clarity issues or scaffoldy loops. Slight tightening and pruning of repeated formulations would bring it into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Information density is high and there are few outright redundancies or scaffolding phrases. That said, figurative language and modifiers are dense enough in places to verge on purple, which can blur edges rather than sharpen them. Slight trimming and variation in texture around peak beats would heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion (e.g., beauty that literally constricts breath). Sentence-level clarity is good; actions and images are easy to follow, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. However, figurative language is very dense—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or lush modifier—creating occasional purple-prose drag and small patches of conceptual overlap (“choking beauty” echoed multiple times). A bit more variation between plain and heightened lines would sharpen impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with good information density and minimal redundancy. Imagery such as the crystalline tear on photographs and walls turning transparent is effective without veering into muddled metaphor. There is some recurrence of similar phrases and a tendency to tell inner states in abstract terms (“shadow work demanded,” “growing weight in her heart”), but it doesn’t seriously slow momentum. The prose is strong and polished enough for many venues, if not yet at the rarefied edge demanded by the very top markets.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax, minimal redundancy, and sentences that pull their weight in advancing either image or interiority. The prose occasionally drifts toward purple (e.g., “vibrant hush,” “slow dance of celestial bodies” repeated, “tiny cosmos”), but it remains intelligible and doesn’t obscure causality. There are some conceptual repeats and abstract labels that could be pared for tautness, yet no major scaffolding or mixed metaphors. The final paragraph lands on a concrete image (sand crunching) that effectively carries thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentences are grammatical and mostly clear, and the narrative moves forward without major scaffolding or paraphrase loops. There is some mild overwriting and repetition—frequent restatement of roles (“lock sentinel”), technology (“illuminating stones”), and stakes—instead of letting implication carry weight. Phrases like “winking hush” and “calmly inventive” gesture toward lyricism but are not consistently supported by fresh, specific imagery. Line-level work is solid but not particularly tight or surprising, leaving room for significant sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional tone. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and thematically aligned (geometry, spirals, resonance), with few outright mixed metaphors. There is some tendency toward abstract or repeated phrasing (“sacred patterns,” “resonant energies”) that could be sharpened or pruned for greater impact. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and momentum largely intact through the climactic sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally polished, with clear syntax and many sentences doing double duty for mood and character. However, the prose leans toward density: metaphors around scars, maps, storms, and light are reused multiple times, and a few phrases feel stock, leading to mild redundancy. The final paragraphs slightly over-explain insights already implied by images, softening impact. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, with no major artifacts or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose often achieves striking images (“brass joints whirring like a philosophical argument unresolved,” “shadow a fractured compass”), and most sentences carry multiple functions (mood, character, and world at once). There is, however, a consistent tendency toward stacked metaphors and high-density figurative language, edging into purple and occasionally feeling self-conscious. Some images repeat the same idea (chaos/order, progress/stillness) without adding new pressure. Overall readability remains high, but line-level restraint would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Many lines are strong and image-rich (“rusted library under stars,” “luminous fracture in the night”), and the prose generally moves efficiently. However, there are visible mechanical slips and artifacts—“like_consts,” “on_dirty,” the sentence fragment “would become weekend collaborators”—that would be unacceptable at a top-tier venue without copyediting. Some metaphors and phrases repeat conceptually (“broken, censored, discarded”) and a few moments edge into purple or redundant summary. These issues don’t obscure meaning but they noticeably dull polish and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, with good rhythm and clear sequencing; most sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, and motion). There is some mild purple and recycled diction (“forgotten dreams,” “secret,” “unique light”) and a few places where abstraction could be sharpened by concrete detail. Still, there are no major loops, no confusing metaphors, and the closure image reads crisply. Line-level craft is strong but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for setting, tone, and theme. Sentence variety is good, and clarity remains intact despite frequent figurative language. There is some tendency toward purple or stacked metaphors (“blossoms unfurling like apologetic palms,” “luminous doubt flickering... like a dying star”) that don’t always add pressure, and a bit of conceptual redundancy around the knowledge fruit’s weight and the island’s logic. For a top-tier venue, a light tightening of ornament and a sharper focus on key images would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for action, atmosphere, and theme. Recurrent metaphors around tides, roots, and color are coherent and patterned rather than purple or redundant. There are very few scaffold lines; nearly every sentence advances mood or character. The prose leans lushly lyrical, but at this length the density remains controlled and readable.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is competent but leans toward "purple" description ("breath mingling with the scent," "violent, compressed deaths") that slows momentum. There is a tendency to over-adjectivize, which reduces the impact of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional but suffers from overwriting and "purple" metaphors ("stars stitching the ink-black sky," "smelling of ghosts") that reduce immediacy. The density of adjectives and abstract descriptors slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition of epithets creates a robotic rhythm; the protagonist is referred to as "The capsize survivor" six times, and "unshaken marvels" appears four times as a fixed label. These artifacts distract significantly from the narrative flow. Clichés like "tear traced her cheek" and "clung to like a life raft" further dilute the prose quality.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but leans on abstract nominalizations ("manifesting as an obsessive refusal") and occasional overwriting ("fractured like frozen lightning"). The line-level craft is competent but suffers from the expository weight required to move the plot across such a long timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is grammatically clean but relies on abstract telling ("practiced economy," "renewed sense of worth") and standard phrasing ("hollowed out," "move like a shadow") rather than concrete sensory imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies on vague causal connectors, using "somehow" three times ("somehow describing," "somehow known," "somehow stored") to hand-wave logic. While rhythmically competent, the reliance on abstract metaphors ("weight of unexplored dimensions") blurs the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by repetitive noun phrases ("hyperbolic geometry," "living bridges") and clunky, tell-heavy phrasings like "retrocognitively trapped." Some filter verbs and melodramatic word choices ("chewing them to bits") detract from the line-level density.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by "writerly" clichés ("dust motes danced," "funeral bells") and logical slips (arranging keys "not by pitch but by frequency" is a tautology, as pitch is frequency). These issues, combined with occasional overwriting ("tiny specter"), distract from the otherwise solid pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has a strong rhythm but relies on stock metaphors ("shadows danced like ghosts," "sharp as glass") and poetic tropes ("echoes of what once was") that feel derivative. While functionally clear, the imagery lacks the freshness required for the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is marred by a severe artifact: the unexplained insertion of Chinese characters ("poured 星光") in the middle of an English sentence disrupts immersion. Additionally, mixed metaphors ("shadow painted in honey") and abstract-physical mismatches ("chest ache with luminous disbelief") degrade clarity. The writing relies heavily on "purple prose" clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is dense with artifacts of overwriting, including strained metaphors ("light's captivity") and cliché personification ("icicles wept"). These stylistic excesses obscure the action and reduce the emotional impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.7)
    Prose is weighed down by purple modifiers and "tell-y" realizations ("realized with a jolt," "adaptive nature asserting itself"). Sentence structure is repetitive, often relying on "He [verb], his [noun] [verbing]" constructions that create a monotone rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe artifacting degrades the prose: the phrase &quot;flaking gold leaf booklet&quot; is repeated four times in a short text, creating a scaffold effect. &quot;Ambered hush&quot; and &quot;marbled hush&quot; are used repetitively, and the density of adjectives slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Polished and readable with good momentum. Some descriptive phrases lean towards cliché ("thousand tiny rainbows"), but the line-level work is generally competent.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("rain-kissed stones," "weight of a thousand unsaid truths") and "purple" metaphors ("shoulders knotting like tangled thread") that obscure rather than reveal. The phrase "resonant hush" is repeated, and the high density of adjectives slows momentum without adding specific information.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.5)
    Required phrases are inserted awkwardly ("commemorating small victories elaborately"), disrupting flow. The prose relies on passive constructions and stock phrases ("defied explanation") that dull the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("practiced precision," "blissfully unaware") and the clumsy, verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("mechanically warm") that disrupts rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by adjectives and "telling," particularly the "miraculous" convenience of the podium. The reliance on abstract descriptors ("unmistakably present," "otherworldly") dilutes the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and abstract metaphors that occasionally obscure clarity ("violent inoculation," "gravitational pull of its absence"). While competent, the reliance on explanation and high-register poeticism slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("cut through the darkness like a scalpel") and heavy-handed similes ("footsteps echoing like judgments"). Abstract phrasing ("swallowed truth," "ozone and regret") muddles the imagery, and the density of metaphors in the climax obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose flows well but relies heavily on abstract nominalizations ("restorative communion," "impermanence") and cliché phrases ("dust motes danced"). This overwriting insulates the reader from specific, tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by abstract nouns and adjectival clutter ("tentative greeting," "witnessed courage"). The density of similes and the reliance on "telling" summaries in the final paragraph disrupt the narrative momentum and distance the reader from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally competent but suffers from occasional clunky phrasing like "sensitively perceptive nature," which reads as a redundant prompt insertion. Some imagery works well ("murmurs in mortar"), but the reliance on procedural description ("Methodically, she activated...") slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is marred by significant cliché usage ("ghost in the machine," "scattered like confetti," "tide will turn," "swallowed by the sea"). While grammatically sound, the reliance on these stock phrases flattens the imagery. The density of information is low due to the high volume of abstract summary regarding his methods.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    The climax relies on telling rather than showing, summarizing the "tapestry of rhetorical devices" instead of dramatizing the specific language used. This abstraction robs the pivotal moment of impact, reducing the confrontation to a list of concepts (metaphors, similes, paradoxes).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from noticeable artifact repetition, specifically the verbatim recurrence of distinctive phrases like "chronological homesickness" and "upturned hush." While the imagery is often strong, the adjectival density ("perfect echo," "singular and strange") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a reliance on abstract nouns (equilibrium, consequence, oblivion) and repetitive sentence structures. Specific phrases like "procedural generation" are inserted awkwardly, reading like prompt checks rather than organic description. The oxymoron "darkness was brighter" appears confused rather than poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.1)
    A severe text-generation artifact ("终于") appears in the climax, shattering immersion. Additionally, the verbatim repetition of phrases ("audibly muted," "faint rustle of turning seasons") in the opening and closing paragraphs creates a mechanical, looped effect that lacks literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is laden with adjective-noun pairs and abstract phrasing ("meticulous precision," "constellation of defiance"). Several prompt elements appear as awkward insertions that break the line-level flow ("his credibly curious nature"). There is a reliance on telling over showing, and the word "meticulous" is repeated distractingly in the opening section.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose struggles with overwrought metaphors (&quot;motives as fragile as the petals,&quot; &quot;fractured monument&quot;) and clunky phrasings like &quot;aromatically cautious.&quot; While grammatically clean, the reliance on &quot;ghosts&quot; and &quot;phantoms&quot; creates a repetitive textural density that lacks freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose suffers from density issues and a reliance on poetic clichés ("whispered promise," "honey-thick viscosity"). Mixed metaphors and abstract phrasings in high-pressure moments obscure the clarity of the action, prioritizing decoration over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is competent but cluttered with filter verbs ("Lyra could feel," "She imagined," "Lyra realized") that dilute immediacy. Phrasing often leans on clichés ("fingers bled," "heavy with the weight," "generations of hands") rather than fresh, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.2)
    The text contains a critical non-English artifact ("were精准") that shatters the fiction, a disqualifying flaw for professional publication. Additionally, the severe looping of identical phrases throughout the piece indicates a lack of syntactic control and editing.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose momentum is stalled by future-perfect summaries ("would later learn") that tell rather than show the climax. Repetitive phrasing is an issue, particularly the forced use of "initiate" and the repeated thematic tag "cycles of compassion," which appear as unintegrated artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density (e.g., "shadows danced like forgotten words," "ink shimmering like captured starlight"). This "purple prose" obscures clarity and action, using three adjectives where one noun would suffice, and relies on cliché abstract constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant text artifacts mar the prose, specifically the intrusion of Chinese characters ("as更多人 than") and a basic article error ("a intricate web"). While the rhythm is generally competent, these errors break immersion and indicate a lack of line-level polish required for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("drip-drip-drip") and melodramatic flourishes ("tears sizzled") that break physical credibility. Several phrases feel like scaffolded insertions of prompt terms rather than organic descriptions, reducing the density and impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("boundless curiosity," "practiced silence") and modifier-heavy phrasing ("unexpected darkness"). "Kindly methodical" serves as tell-heavy shorthand for characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but occasionally dips into "purple" description ("sky bruised purple and wept") or clichés ("taut wire vibrating"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("he felt," "he saw") that distances the reader during moments that demand immediacy. The rhythm is generally good, but the "unfurling fern frond" is a slight sonic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of specific phrases ("wryly earnest" x3, "haggard awe" x2, "thresh meaning" x4), creating a mechanical, looping effect. While grammatically sound, the reliance on these static labels instead of fresh description stifles the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    Phrasing is often clunky ("formation-filled chambers," "steadily unpredictable") and reliant on adjective-noun pairings that slow momentum. The prose tends to report the magic's effects ("overwhelmed her senses") rather than evoking the sensory reality through specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but leans heavily on abstract nouns and passive descriptions ("opacity of memory"). Several clichés ("parting with a limb," "sunlight breaking through clouds") flatten the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is laden with purple artifacts ("starlit vault," "shroud," "poem of his journey") and repetitive phrasing ("phantom," "dared"). The "analytically artistic" descriptor is a repeated scaffold that adds no texture. Weak verbs and abstract nouns dominate, stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.1)
    A disqualifying meta-comment ("[650? No, recount needed.]") and verbatim paragraph repetition appear at the closure beat. The prose suffers from "purple" descriptors ("grief clung... like salt") and lacks rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by significant repetitive artifacts: the phrase "hushed thunder" appears four times, "escondite" seven times, and "cursed amulet fragment" three times, creating a tedious echo. Metaphor density is high ("origami collapse," "cartographer of unseen maps"), often obstructing clarity and pacing during the climax. These issues suggest a need for aggressive line-editing to reduce redundancy and sharpen imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.2)
    A significant grammar error ("will momentarily liquefied") disrupts the reading experience. Additionally, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "deathly vitality" within a short word count reads as a prompt-stitching artifact rather than intentional repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is competent but suffers from overwriting and template cadence in the list-like descriptions of the stationery. Phrases like "incandescent restraint" read as oxymoronic clutter rather than precise description.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("mosaic of forgotten moments") and "tell" constructions that summarize emotional states. Heavy use of Latinate diction ("monolith," "testimonial," "transmutation") creates a purple texture that dulls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from adjectival clutter and clichés ("swirling masterpiece," "myth buster of cosmic proportions") that dilute the imagery. The reliance on abstraction ("something magical happened") at the inciting moment robs the scene of immediacy. The writing feels decorated rather than dense, with adjectives doing work that strong verbs should handle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.5)
    While technically polished, the prose suffers from heavy "telling" and abstract phrasing ("shifting hues of hope and decay"). The reliance on summary creates a lack of immediacy, and the density of adjectives slows the momentum without adding concrete textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; the ten-syllable phrase "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" appears four times in full, creating a jarring template cadence. Additionally, key descriptors like "purposefully curious" and "dawning hush" are repeated verbatim, reducing lexical variety and density.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés and purple phrasing ("tender touch," "fingers dancing," "magnetic calm," "gentle veil"). The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation needed to build tension. Sentences often serve as scaffolding for abstract sentiments rather than conveying concrete action or sensory friction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("dry as dust," "force of a breaking dam," "fallen leaves") and overwrought similes ("clicks echoed like tiny heralds of revelation"). These artifacts obscure the action and render the style derivative rather than distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies heavily on "as if" simile scaffolding (five instances: "as if it were thirsty," "as if remembering," etc.) to explain images rather than showing them. Clichés like "hollow eyes" and "ripples in a pond" flatten the imagery. The rhythm is repetitive, lacking the variation needed for the "dance" described.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.2)
    A catastrophic tense shift occurs halfway through (paragraphs 1–6 are past tense; paragraph 7 onward is present), rendering the piece unpublishable in its current state. Additionally, severe repetition of full phrases ("distress signal sender," "gathered hush," "time runs short") creates a distracting, algorithmic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is marred by significant artifact looping, with complex phrases ("narrow door left ajar for decades," "copperlight repose," "chase hush") repeated verbatim across the short text. These echoes disrupt the reading flow and signal a lack of line-level polish and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and clichés ("lace of a bride’s veil torn by time," "susurrus of regret"). The insertion of the required phrase "cameo appearances" creates a register break that disrupts the story's immersive quality, and the reliance on abstract adjectives flattens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    The word "impossible" appears five times, creating a repetitive lexical loop that dilutes the impact of the imagery. The prose is otherwise polished but relies on these crutch words to convey wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and abstract nouns ("fractured symbol," "warmly curious sensation"). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") dilute immediacy. The writing tells rather than shows, using label-heavy phrasing ("cautious enchantment") that acts as a scaffold rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetition of full noun phrases ("golden arcade," "ebony clipboard," "children's sidewalk chalk") creates a robotic, looping rhythm. The prose relies on telling ("Careful invention had been his hallmark") and dense adjectival stacking ("vaporized memories," "compressed rainbows") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition and lexical looping undermine the prose. The phrase "echoed silence" appears four times, "eternal candle" six times, and "cobalt" three times within a short space. This synonym churn creates a robotic, template-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive phrasing ("singing spirits" appears seven times; the prompt phrase "fierce tenderness" appears three times) creates a distracting, mechanical rhythm. Clichéd imagery ("skeletal fingers," "words swallowed") and scaffolded sentence structures drag down line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant "purple prose" density hampers momentum; metaphors stack rapidly ("tears," "shrouds," "medals," "fossils") without breathing room, violating the density rubric. The repetition of "tears" (twilight’s, forgotten) and abstract labels ("syntax of suffering") results in a cloying texture that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose relies on passive constructions ("began to display itself") and stock comparisons ("more precious than gold," "sharp... as a splinter"). Repetitive labeling of the emotion ("pensive mirth") and low information density in the middle section drag the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is overwritten with dense, sometimes mixed metaphors ("patience of a tide," "swallowed the light") that clutter the imagery. Key phrases ("methodically playful") are repeated as static scaffolds, and the reliance on adverbs weakens the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is readable but marred by "tell" phrasing ("mischief he’d cultivated") and cliché descriptors. The phrase "converging chaos" is repeated awkwardly as a tag, seemingly to satisfy a prompt requirement rather than serving the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition of constraint phrases ("reef-shadow joy," "shyly unstoppable," "half-sung lullabies" each appear 3+ times) creates noticeable artifacts. Mixed metaphors ("photosynthesize pain") and purple prose reduce clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.3)
    Significant loop artifacts mar the prose; phrases like "opal library above clouds," "museum of extinct feelings," and "foxglove regret" are repeated 3–4 times each in a short space. These repetitions act as filler and dull the imagery, triggering the text-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is severely marred by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases; "symphonies of truth" appears eight times and "interconnected promises" five times in a very short space, creating a distracting loop artifact. The writing relies on filter verbs ("she could almost hear," "she felt") and clichéd sensory descriptions ("shimmering like liquid starlight"). The density of adjectives slows the momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.8)
    A significant reality-check failure occurs with the floodgate capacity (77 cubic meters is ~20,000 gallons, barely a swimming pool, impossible for a town's water supply), shattering credibility. The prose suffers from repetitive insertion of prompt phrases as clunky modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is dense with adjectives and mixed metaphors ("wildfire flowers," "chaotic ballet," "star-chart"), creating drag. Repetitive phrasing ("blooming," "withering," "paper trail") within short spans reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant text artifacts appear: the phrase "featherly determined" repeats three times (including near closure), and "fractured" repeats frequently, creating a loop effect. The prose relies on abstract filtering verbs ("intuit," "tracing") instead of concrete action, obscuring the mechanical logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on clichés ("heartbeat quickened," "pure astonishment") and "tell-y" summaries of mental processes. The "still warm" feather constitutes a significant logic artifact that the prose treats as poetic mystery rather than physical impossibility. Repetition of the phrase "softly ingenious" for both the character and the machine exposes the scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose suffers from clichés ("sand through fingers," "connecting the dots") and repetition ("cheerful gloom" used twice as a label). Sentence structures are repetitive, frequently relying on participle openers.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from density of stock metaphors and "creative writing" artifacts ("eyes like shattered glass," "laughter trailing... like confetti," "mask of calm indifference"). These flourishes act as scaffolding that obscures the action rather than revealing it. The rhythm is often monotone, relying on adjective-heavy descriptions that slow the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies on telling ("Her motivation was to...") and heavy adjectival stacking ("measured and deliberate," "infinite, profound"). There are noticeable craft slips, such as the clunky noun phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" and the redundant "fledge—shedding her former identity like a fledgling." The rhythm is often stalled by expository clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and mixed metaphors ("slung over one shoulder like a second spine," "seagulls hovering like overgrown thoughts"). High density of abstract adjectives and repetitive refrains impedes momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from high density of "purple" artifacts and clichés ("ink spilled across parchment," "celestial slow dance" used twice). Mixed metaphors ("constellation of burn scars... mapped... like topographic lines") clutter the imagery. The rhythm is sluggish, weighed down by adjectives and abstract noun phrases that tell rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose relies heavily on a simile scaffold ("as if" appears seven times), creating distance and explaining rather than showing. Key phrases ("serene upheaval," "lucidly watchful") are repeated verbatim, creating a robotic, checklist-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies on weak descriptors and telling, most notably the repeated, clunky phrase "sensitively perceptive." Clichés like "coiled like a snake" and convenient modifiers like "miraculously legible" undermine the craft. The sentence structure tends toward a repetitive rhythm that lacks propulsion during the discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition of scaffold phrases damages the prose flow: "borrowed heartbeat" appears six times, "prism parapet" four times, and "echoing terrace" three times in a short space. These text artifacts read as a checklist, obstructing the rhythm and density of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("slow dance of celestial bodies" x3, "ebony clipboard" x4, "operatively gentle" x3) creates a distractingly artificial cadence. The prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and purple descriptions ("vessel through ritual significance") that obscure the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=3.2)
    The text contains severe proofreading artifacts, including foreign characters ("perfectly平整"), missing spaces ("WithSettings," "hisActions"), and missing words ("map had followed"). Additionally, the repetition of prompt phrases ("fractured grace," "amoral philanthropist") feels mechanical and unpolished.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose is dense with "purple" abstractions, mixed metaphors, and awkward phrasing ("bodied poetic"). The text frequently explains its own metaphors ("harvest... was not sound but memory") and relies on cliché constructions like "trapped... like trapped fireflies."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is mechanically competent but overwritten, relying on "purple" phrasing and similes ("darkness descended like a velvet curtain," "epiphany came not like lightning but like dawn filtering through dust motes"). These flourishes slow momentum without adding precision. There is a tendency to "tell" emotions and atmosphere through adjectives rather than evoking them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("blushing stillness" appears three times; "transiently rooted" appears three times) creates a palpable text artifact effect. The prose is often overwritten with adjectival padding ("moist stone," "verdant mosses," "supple branches") that slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is functional but marred by the mechanical repetition of unique descriptors ("technically gentle fingers/hands," "snowmelt ardor"), which creates a template-like rhythm. The reliance on abstract, flowery descriptions ("turning dust and silence into illumination") reduces the density and precision of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is competent and occasionally evocative ("approaching storm sang a low counterpoint"), but leans into abstraction during key beats ("sickness was conceptual"). Some sentences explain the action's significance rather than letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from reliance on clichés ("bled into the horizon," "forces beyond naming") and abstract nominalizations ("empirically ironic nature") that dilute immediacy. While rhythmically competent, the line-level craft lacks the freshness required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe lexical repetition; "cellular memory" appears six times, acting as a semantic loop rather than a meaningful motif. Phrases like "shifting grace," "music box," and "resentment" are overused to the point of distraction within such a short word count. Clichés such as "tears cascaded" and "reality shifted... like waves in a pond" further dilute the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished and flows well, though it occasionally relies on "telling" abstract states ("patterns that felt both random and inevitable") rather than showing them. The "quantum alchemy" line constitutes a significant text artifact that disrupts the world's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.3)
    Adjective-noun pairings are dense and often cliché ("tattered ribbon," "rough-hewn wood," "leafy sea"), creating a "painted" effect that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetitive looping of specific phrases ("simply complicated" appears 5 times; "brightened disquiet" appears 4 times; "Between the first and last page" 3 times) acts as a distracting text artifact. This scaffold usage obscures the prose rhythm and indicates a checklist approach rather than organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but occasionally repetitive in syntax (frequent Subject-Verb openers) and leans on adjective-heavy abstraction ("sorrowful, terrible understanding"). The summary passage in the middle disrupts the rhythmic propulsion of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of multi-word prompt phrases ("emerald swatch card," "narrative threads," "garden of forgotten names," "unkindled solace") creates a jarring, repetitive cadence (lexical saturation). Sentence structures are monotonous, frequently relying on "The [noun] [verb], and [action]" templates.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but prone to overwriting ("perfume of fables," "patient gods"), which sometimes obscures the immediate physical action with abstract metaphor. The reliance on "suddenly knew" shortcuts in the climax undercuts the otherwise competent line-level descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant repetition of prompt phrases ("bloom of hush" appears five times; "echo chamber stone" four times) creates a stuttering rhythm. The prose suffers from "keyword stuffing," where required terms are inserted mechanically, and "hammered repose" is used awkwardly as a noun phrase rather than informing the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.3)
    Significant repetitive artifacts appear, particularly the clumsy recurrence of "retrocognitively blessed" and similar stems which clogs the rhythm. The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and adjectives ("fractured rainbows," "thistle-blown hope") rather than concrete verbs and specific imagery. The "shard of hush" is treated as a physical object without establishing a credible physical logic, creating a figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe artifact penalty: the complex phrase "preemptively nostalgic" is repeated four times, creating a jarring loop that breaks immersion and signals a lack of lexical control. The prose is dense with abstract metaphors ("sculpt identity," "threads of forgotten joy") that obscure the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by abstract phrasing ("defy the gravity of hopelessness") and standard metaphors ("painted the evening sky"). The rhythm is steady, but the density of specific, concrete imagery is low relative to the abstract sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally lapses into "purple" phrasing or clichés ("pooled like liquid thought," "vast indifferent night"). While the flow is good, these artifacts of overwriting reduce the immediacy of the scene. The physical descriptions of the cicada are the strongest prose elements, grounding the loftier abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant line-level flaws include a scaffold/grammar artifact ("ritual of by limiting"), a mixed metaphor ("blink of a heartbeat"), and clunky phrasing ("intangibly tangible"). These issues disrupt immersion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive looping in the final third destroys momentum; variations of "the work was done," "the vial was still," and "the quiet was kind" are repeated across ten sentences. Phrases like "fluidly logical" are inserted mechanically three times (a text artifact). The prose creates a drumbeat of synonym churn without advancing the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is competent and readable, maintaining momentum. However, it leans on cliché phrasing ("heart raced," "time had forgotten," "dizzying prism") and some convenient summary, which flattens the emotional impact of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is marred by repetitive word choices ("encroaching" appears three times; "loaded emptiness" is repeated as a refrain that feels forced). Clichéd phrasing ("thinning like smoke in wind," "phantom pains") reduces the impact of the imagery. The repetition of the prompt phrase "loaded emptiness" in the final sentence creates a loop artifact rather than a resonant callback.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weighed down by abstractions ("concepts began to bleed," "discordant memories") and clichés ("crushing weight," "cutting through darkness"). The misuse of "existently" and the reliance on adverbs to carry weight weaken the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and vague figurative language (e.g., shadows "danced like old memories" is visually empty). Anthropomorphism ("room sighed") and clichés ("tide against the shore") dilute the impact. Information density is low due to ornamental filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.5)
    A pivotal grammatical error ("he unsnap") damages the climax, and the prompt phrase "factually mystical" is inserted awkwardly as a modifier. The prose suffers from purple descriptors ("dull as forgotten vows") and the repetition of "shivering bliss" creates a lexical loop that dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract emotional telling ("solace," "sorrow," "broken-hearted") and filter verbs ("noticed," "felt") that dull immediacy. Phrases like "sad tapestry" and "tactfully hopeful" read as clichés or unearned labels rather than fresh descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive adverbs and phrasing ("carefully noting," "carefully resourceful," "carefully preserve," "unassuming maintenance worker," "unassuming work"). These echoes flatten the prose and indicate a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is functional but relies on several stock phrases ("committed their positions to memory," "sent a chill," "etched with worry"). The phrase "vested hush" feels inserted rather than organic, though the description of the light fracturing is vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive scaffolding, with specific phrases repeated three times each in a short space, creating a template-like cadence. The writing relies heavily on "telling" via summary and realization verbs ("Elias realized," "regional folklore promised") rather than immediate scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt," "He decided") that distance the reader. Some imagery borders on cliché ("gears... like tiny skeletons"), though the rhythm is generally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is dense with abstract metaphors and "purple" constructions that obscure the scene (e.g., "smelled of sulfur and sorrow," "luminous with regret"). There are frequent "tell" phrases that summarize complex states ("factually mystical," "shards of broken intention") instead of showing them. The line-level craft prioritizes ornamental adjectives over active verbs, resulting in a sluggish pace despite the short word count.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with purple artifacts and mixed metaphors (e.g., "spit it back fractured," "tones wrapping... like ivy," "thread of gold in her gray tapestry"). Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery, and the density of adjectives slows momentum without adding precision. The phrase "luminous ache" appears as a sentimental cliché that summarizes emotion instead of evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is weighted down by filter verbs ("Kael felt," "He could feel") that distance the reader from the sensory details. Additionally, the presence of a text artifact ("квартet") and the jarring insertion of a mathematical formula disrupt the narrative flow and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant prose artifacts and "purple" abstraction appear throughout (e.g., "elusively tangible," "pulse like a heartbeat"). The phrase "unfasten the [noun]" is repeated three times in a short space, creating a distractingly repetitive loop. Abstract labels ("anchor of intuition") replace concrete description.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, particularly in the use of adjective-adverb clusters ("skillfully observant," "agonizingly beautiful," "near-perfect circular"). The density of modifiers and personification metaphors ("cracks... whispered histories") creates a sluggish rhythm and obscures the concrete action, triggering the overwriting penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose relies on several stock phrases ("sickening clarity," "split the air like thunder," "chorus of ghosts") that dilute the imagery. These clichés prevent the line-level craft from reaching higher bands despite functional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.0)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose relies on stock phrases ("groaned with the weight of history," "rattled their gilded cages") and mixed metaphors ("spooling," "eddies," "congeal") that muddy the visual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but dense with decorative "noun of abstract noun" constructions (e.g., "springs of lapsed time," "covenant of rust"). These flourishes occasionally act as scaffolding that distances the reader from the immediate action, favoring "tinkersong" aesthetics over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("hissing with a silence all its own"). Information density is high, though occasionally metaphors stack heavily ("stratified whispers") in a way that risks slight opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe repetition of keyword phrases ("timewoven alliances" x4, "turbine-hum reverie" x4, "perpetually learning" x3) creates a distractingly artificial cadence. These artifacts clutter the prose and prevent immersion, triggering the penalty for template cadence/loops.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.4)
    Repetitive phrasing dulls the opening ("winter's last snow" appears twice in the first paragraph; "dawning hush" repeats). The premise relies on a significant logic break—claiming science is unaware of moth/bat pollination—which undermines the intellectual credibility of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe overwriting and metaphor density trigger multiple penalties; phrases like "bones to water," "precise as prayer," and "obsidian eye winking shut" create a dense, opaque surface that stalls momentum. The prose prioritizes performative literary signaling over clarity, resulting in mixed metaphors and "purple prose" artifacts throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by abstract modifiers ("vibrant intent," "infrastructure of possibility") and stock phrasing ("shimmering into existence"). Filter verbs clutter the high-pressure moments, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally high-quality, but occasional abstract summaries ("defied logic and gravity," "manifested across cultures") flatten the impact. The phrase "velvet disquiet" borders on purple but is integrated smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is mechanically functional but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and purple phrasing ("verse in the poem of reduction"). Several clichés appear ("cold enough to crack stone," "plume of silver"). The scientific term "decreasing entropy" clashes tonally with the otherwise mystic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is mechanically clean but relies on stock phrasing ("practiced hands," "deliberate movements," "satisfied nod"). The narrative relies heavily on "telling" summary rather than immediate scene work, which dilutes the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("gasping its last breath," "profound clarity") and abstract "scaffold" phrases that obscure concrete imagery. The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation and propulsion required for a publishable short story.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose leans toward purple abstraction ("fractured reality," "tangled covenant") and cliché ("hues of blood and ash"). The phrase "contextual clues" is a jarring artifact that disrupts the literary texture, reading as a mechanical insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on filtering and summary ("The journal explained the time capsule's purpose") instead of showing the scene unfold. There are logical and phrasing artifacts, such as the cliché "a method so mundane it was brilliant," which attempts to gloss over the lack of connective tissue between plot points.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.4)
    The phrase "burnished hush" is repeated as a stock descriptor, and the prose relies on cliché modifiers ("scarlet vein," "captured twilight"). Filter verbs ("seemed," "knew") and abstract phrasing dilute the physical immediacy of the weaving action.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished and readable but relies on familiar similes ("fray like old rope") and abstract assertions ("memory, or intention") instead of concrete density. The heavy use of summary drains momentum from potential high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "dusty/soaked" contradiction undermines the physical logic of the scene. The prose relies on repetitive phrases and abstract filtering that distances the reader from immediate experience, and the "luminous skeptic" phrasing reads as an adjective-noun clutter artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by repetitive phrasing (e.g., "hollow expanse that mirrored the hollow," "narrow vastness... narrow in form yet vast") and clichés ("firm yet gentle"). The density of abstract nouns and heavy modification slows momentum without adding necessary detail, creating a "purple" texture that obscures immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is clean but marred by expository lumps ("The method was brilliant...") that stall momentum during the climax. Several phrases tell rather than show ("intuitively descriptive mind," "something of a marvel").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from expository telling ("He realized what he was seeing," "The insight struck him"). Several phrases are clichéd ("died embers," "physical blow"). The writing is functional but relies on abstract summaries of mental states instead of concrete, immediate action or sensory data to convey the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and cliché ("grace of a falling leaf," "heartbeat a frantic rhythm"). The continuity break regarding the physical nature of the sundial lid confuses the closing action.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.8)
    Heavy repetition of complex phrases ("nomadic penumbra" x3, "benevolently ruthless" x2, "luminous" x3) creates a mechanical, stuttering rhythm. The high density of abstract metaphor ("secrets like dandelion seeds") crowds out concrete action and creates a barrier to clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.5)
    Phrasing suffers from cliché ("delicate as a feather," "unseen hand") and repetitive labeling ("painful/painfully" x3, "hidden thunder" x3). The prose often tells rather than shows, particularly regarding the magic's mechanics and the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts; "fidgets productively" and "fierce repose" are both used twice verbatim in a short space, exposing the scaffolding. Heavy reliance on abstract nouns and "telling" constructions ("The goal was singular," "The method... was clear") saps momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is functional but suffers from repetitive vocabulary (forms of "refract" appear four times) and clumsy phrasing ("naturally innocently mischievous nature"). Abstract concepts are treated as concrete mechanics without sufficient grounding in the scene's physical reality, leading to moments of vague "purple" description that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings and clichés ("otherworldly light," "precariously," "desperately"). Abstract phrasing ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") often replaces concrete sensory detail or specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is mechanically competent but dense with clichés ("hands trembled with age," "echoing in his soul," "wind tousling his hair"). There is a reliance on "was" constructions and filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized") that dilutes immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has high information density and strong imagery ("needle of intent"), but occasionally tilts into overwriting ("sky bruised," "screaming tenderness" as a label). The filter verbs noted in Q6 also drag on the line-level immediacy here.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like unanswered prayers," "like poetry," "like liquid moonlight," "like a silver coin"), creating a repetitive "A is like B" cadence. This figurative overcrowding reduces the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric. However, the specific phrase "fractured grace" is repeated twice in close proximity (paragraphs 5 and 7), which feels like a forced insertion of the prompt element rather than organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.9)
    The attribute phrase "softly persistent" is repeated three times as a modifier ("pull," "nature," "pull"), creating a noticeable lexical loop that feels like a scaffold artifact. The prose is functional but weighed down by adjectives and explicit thematic summary at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("knew every crease by heart," "time, like water," "trembling fingers," "heart pounding"). While grammatically clean, the density of stock phrasing and personification ("maps whispered") prevents the imagery from feeling fresh or urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is weakened by significant repetition ("celestial" x4, "grotto" x4, "cobalt" x2) and the verbatim recycling of the phrase "softly commanding voice." Logic flaws in phrasing ("impassable... continued on foot") and heavy reliance on telling similes ("like the sound of a kingdom beginning to fracture") clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is density-heavy with adjectives and abstract nouns ("immutable decisions," "directed spontaneity"), resulting in a "purple" texture that slows momentum. Several required phrases are shoehorned in awkwardly (e.g., "The process by returning differently was her signature"), disrupting the syntactic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of cliché similes and stock phrasing ("creaked like old bones," "practiced hands," "familiar coat," "mountain streams," "howled like wolves"). These artifacts flatten the imagery and obscure the character's unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "therapy-speak" abstractions ("emotional terrain," "pain into purpose") and clichés ("scattered constellations," "trembling calm"). While the rhythm is smooth, these artifacts distance the reader from the visceral reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and polished, with strong information density and evocative imagery (e.g., "shedding his analogue self," "humiliation made beautiful"). The line-level craft supports the magical realism of the piece without falling into purple prose or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing like "a mix of gravel and starlight" that calls attention to itself without adding clarity. Rhythmic control is adequate, though the pacing feels static due to the lack of tension in the central exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "abstractitis," often using complex noun phrases ("paradox of profound reverberation") where concrete images would be stronger. Minor redundancies ("traversed across") and the repetition of "resounding hush" detract from the precision required at this length. The density of abstract concepts slows momentum without adding distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is competent but relies on some clichés ("practiced hands," "intricate dance," "quiet embrace"). The line-level craft tends toward telling over showing, particularly regarding the protagonist's internal realizations and the nature of the "anomalies."

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies on repetitive labels ("familiar strangers" appears three times; "quiet wildfire" twice) and clichés instead of fresh, concrete imagery. While the sentence rhythm is competent, the heavy use of abstract summary and "scaffold" phrases prevents the scene from achieving necessary density or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.1)
    The specific phrase "clover melancholy" is repeated verbatim in the first and last paragraphs, creating a distraction. Metaphors are frequent but often mixed or strained ("hospital’s white walls... roulette wheel").

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a repetitive iterative cadence ("would begin," "would ring," "would pulse") that creates distance. While the imagery is strong, the lack of scene-level propulsion makes the text feel static and expository.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("haunted euphoria," "regenerated covenant," "proximate causes," "small moments") creates a loop artifact that dulls the prose. The final paragraph acts as a list-like summary of these terms rather than a narrative conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is functional but relies on stock phrasing and familiar similes ("fraying like his patience," "vacuum in his chest," "symphony of sounds," "climbing out of a tomb"). These clichés dilute the sensory immediacy of the listening experience.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies on significant clichés ("liquid sunlight," "lover's sigh," "quiet the storm") that degrade literary quality. A repetitive template cadence appears in the middle ("The first note came...", "The second note arrived...", "The third note came...") without earning the repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant verbatim repetition of the full phrase "the dried-up fountain pen with its exotic nib" (three times) creates a distracting scaffold artifact. The prose is otherwise functional but suffers from "telling" emotional states instead of showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from significant "overwriting" artifacts, including stacked abstract nouns ("hues of melancholy," "weight of unspoken melodies") and mixed metaphors. There is frequent redundancy in phrasing (mapping silence, translating silence, silence between notes), and emotions are told/labeled rather than shown through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from purple phrasing and mixed metaphors ("volcanic tenderness of cooling lava," "heart a tender volcano") that obscure clarity. Reliance on abstract descriptors ("analytically intuitive") instead of concrete imagery weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition of keyword phrases ("hush of the universe," "auric lagoon," "entangled memories") creates a looping artifact that stalls momentum. Clichés like "tears streaking his face" and "running out of time" dilute the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is weighed down by adjective-heavy clusters ("corrugated sides," "unnatural energy," "calculated spontaneity"). The phrase "calculated spontaneity" is explicitly namedropped to satisfy the prompt rather than embodied in the rhythm, creating a "telling" artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose density is compromised by frequent abstract metaphors ("brass fittings weathered to the color of lost hopes") and cliché phrasing ("tears tracing paths... like miniature tributaries"). The forced inclusion of "spiralingly calm" results in an awkward modifier stack that disrupts the rhythm and clarity of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but overly dense with simile churn (nearly one per paragraph) and decorative metaphors that slow momentum; phrases like "chambers of the heart" and "whispered like wind" lean into cliché rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is polished and readable but leans on clichés ("moved like liquid," "home in her own skin") and abstract phrasing. The density of "telling" reduces momentum, particularly in the reflective passages that interrupt the action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.0)
    Momentum is stalled by explanatory scaffolding (e.g., "The morally ambiguous path Elara walked involved...", "Elara's motivation stretched beyond..."). These summaries tell the reader what to feel rather than letting the scene do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is marred by repetitive phrasing (the full phrase "lantern-moth hush" appears twice; "cobalt atrium" and "humming quartz colonnade" repeat often) and filter verbs ("felt," "understood") that dull immediacy. Adjective-heavy description slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and descriptive, with strong visual imagery ("fractured light," "universe of peach and rose"). Rhythm is controlled and the sensory shift at the climax is handled with good density, though some phrasing veers slightly into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from "overwriting," relying on abstract noun phrases ("texture of connection," "weight of absence") and interpretive summary rather than concrete action. The phrase "powerfully gentle" is an awkward oxymoron that distracts rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("rock bottom," "storm clouds," "deepest valleys") and iterative summary ("Elian would illuminate") rather than concrete scene work. The lack of specific, singular action renders the imagery generic and low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is weighed down by purple abstractions ("prism refracting," "ruler of destiny") and repetitive prompt insertions ("steadily curious heart"). The rhythm is sluggish, relying on "and then" sequencing rather than active causality.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from abstraction and summary ("moving, breathing, and thinking in sequences") where concrete detail is needed. "Steadily unpredictable" reads as a forced oxymoron inserted for the prompt rather than a coherent description. The reliance on abstract nouns ("essence," "experiences," "energy") dilutes the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.1)
    Significant text artifacts mar the prose, specifically the verbatim repetition of long phrases ("by comparing silent video footage from decades apart") and epithets within a short word count. These loops stall narrative momentum and draw attention to the writing's construction rather than the story itself. The prose leans on purple descriptors ("shelves themselves breathed") that obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from noticeable repetition ("shimmering stillness" appears twice; "reconstruct" and "shedding layers" repeat frequently). The presence of the likely typo "deepcretion" significantly undermines line-level authority for a literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe text artifacts (code strings, Chinese, and Hindi characters) render the prose unpublishable. The writing also suffers from purple phrasing ("modern medicine's kiss," "meteor hush") that strains for poetic effect but lands on confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.9)
    Heavy reliance on filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt," "He knew") and abstract phrasing distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is dense with purple artifacts ("shadowed rapture," "golden tear," "ghostly echoes") and cliché similes ("like snow melting in spring"). Filter verbs ("Elara knew," "she felt") and abstract noun phrases obscure the action, reducing the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from awkward integration of required phrases ("Occasionally everywhere") that disrupts syntax. The "technobabble" explanation ("whisper to the uncertainty," "quantum foam") feels like scaffolding rather than grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.5)
    While sentence rhythm is functional, the severe proofreading error (name drift: Elian/Elias/Elliot) disrupts the reading experience. Abstract, "purple" phrasing ("understanding distilled into vibration") occasionally obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("shoreline lullaby" appears four times; "veiled ridgeway," "unused courage," and "indirect routes" appear three times each). These function as scaffold loops that stifle momentum and create a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by forced modifiers (e.g., "seraphically mundane" describing footsteps is jarring). The text relies on "felt" and "realized" filters during the climax, reducing the immediacy of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose leans toward purple ("groaned under the weight," "glamorous facade") and relies on cliché constructions ("Not with a roar, but with..."). While there are moments of nice imagery (the ink blooming), the reliance on adjective-heavy telling ("terrifying tremor," "sacred silence") reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe simile density ("like a dying whale," "like ghosts," "like dawn," "like rivers, like time, like memory") creates a repetitive, stuttering rhythm. The prose leans into "purple" description that distracts from the action and feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is marred by strained similes ("gripping... as if it were a celestial body") and frequent clichés ("dust motes... like distant galaxies," "wings like folded hands"). The repetition of prompt phrases as tells ("awkwardly confident") weakens line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose relies heavily on adjectival padding ("treacherous path," "insurgent spirit," "cryptic script") and standard clichés ("cracked open like an egg"). Telling outweighs showing, with significant emotional and historical weight summarized in abstract phrases. The rhythm is repetitive, lacking the sentence-level propulsion required for a high-stakes scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prompt phrases ("quietly talented hands," "somatic markers," "anchor optimism") are repeated verbatim, creating a checklist effect that mars the prose rhythm. The writing is functional but relies on telling and filter verbs rather than active density.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and mixed metaphors ("splintered wood... like fractured memories," "shadows that danced like lost futures") that obscure the physical reality of the scene. The capitalization of "Filterless" is distracting, and the reliance on cliché ("where the light gets in") weakens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies on a repetitive rhetorical loop ("not [X], but [Y]") used three times ("not the calm... but the pause," "not hot... but serene," "not as an act... but as one"), creating a distracting template cadence. Clichés like "calm before a storm," "eye of a storm," and "oil on water" reduce the imagery to stock phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=2.3)
    Severe prose artifacts define the text. Prompt phrases are repeated verbatim multiple times ("bravely conflicted" x4, "echoing library under snow" x4, "dangerous liaison letter" x3, "the blink that follows surprise" x3), creating a robotic, template-filling cadence. Clichés ("shattered their carefully constructed lies," "carry the torch") further degrade density and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on filtering ("Elara felt," "Elara had learned") and abstract telling ("inculcating plants with values") rather than concrete showing. Phrasing is occasionally awkward or clichéd ("senselessly perceptive" reads like a malapropism; "gleaming with the memories"); the repetition of the "tranquil blaze" motif feels forced rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with adjective-noun pairings ("velvet black," "sorrowful light," "profane iron") that slow momentum and violate concision. Abstract nouns ("potential," "divinity," "emptiness") frequently replace concrete imagery, creating a "purple" style that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from lexical repetition (variations of "contradiction" and "intervene" appear frequently) and strained metaphors ("spun like a slow, deliberate regret"). While grammatically clean, the style leans toward the melodramatic and abstract rather than the concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is generally polished, but a jarring text artifact ("down to the分毫 of its antennae") breaks immersion completely—a critical copy-editing failure. Additionally, the opening simile ("steady as the northern star") is a worn cliché that detracts from the otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.0)
    Significant overwriting and modifier clutter ("reverent curiosity," "terrifyingly significant"). Mixed metaphors like "breath that tasted of lilac and courage" obscure clarity for the sake of forced poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe register drift and awkward integration of prompt phrases; "retrocognitively trapped" clashes violently with the "ancient plaza" aesthetic. Artifact density is high, with key phrases ("warm coldness," "gentle radical") pasted in verbatim, creating a "Mad Libs" effect that disrupts rhythm and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose relies on abstract telling ("synesthetically blessed nature," "rewriting history by sharing his passion") rather than concrete action. Adjective stacking ("hand-painted tarot coin") and exposition dumps slow the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.1)
    Word choice suffers from repetitive phrasing ("fractally precise" appears twice; "static shock" appears three times). The prose relies on simile and metaphor density ("bled like watercolor," "anchor in the storm") that occasionally clutters the image. Telling often substitutes for showing in key transition beats.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose relies on clichés ("heart pounding," "visions flooded her mind") and abstract emotional nouns ("rage," "joy") that violate the show-don't-tell principle. The phrase "factually mystical" creates a jarring register break, and filter verbs dilute the immediacy of the visions.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is dense with "purple" artifacts and mixed metaphors ("hummed with unearthed silence," "spin a prophecy," "walls dissolving into light"). Abstract phrasing consistently obscures physical action, and the reliance on filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and "purple" artifacts ("ectoplasmic water," "unfurling it felt like cracking a bone"). Repetitive phrasing ("silver hush," "prudently daring") and reliance on abstract metaphors ("hoarded like a forgotten currency") create a dense, scaffolded texture that impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant overwriting and telling diminish the impact; phrases like "meaning convergent" abstract the climax instead of showing it. Repetitive vocabulary ("percolated/percolating," "spindrift serenity" x2, "palimpsest promise" x2) within a short space creates a text-artifact feel.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose leans toward the purple ("sharp gentleness," "nutrient to his spirit") with metaphors that obscure immediate physical action; "sharp gentleness" appears as a repetitive bookend.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from clichéd phrasing ("bobbed like corks," "holding its breath") and repetitive use of prompt strings ("wistfully pragmatic," "bitting gauge tooth"). The rhythm is hampered by the need to insert these phrases whole, creating a mechanical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.3)
    Significant repetitive artifacts appear (e.g., "brittle awakenings" and "atomically reflective" repeated as fixed phrases), suggesting forced insertion. Heavy reliance on filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") and abstract nouns drains momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is mechanically competent but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and metaphors ("prismatic quiet," "frozen blossom"). The repetition of "prismatic" and phrases like "world's own absolution" verge on purple prose, distracting from the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is weighed down by stock phrasing ("working tirelessly," "overwhelming odds," "defied conventional explanation") and lack of sensory specificity. Information is often conveyed through summary rather than concrete, unfolding action.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is severely marred by the verbatim repetition of entire phrases (e.g., "reverberation of a lonely church organ" appears four times) within a short space. This rote recycling of descriptors creates a mechanical loop that destroys momentum and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose leans heavily into "purple" descriptors ("furrowed hush," "stone lips," "lance the truth") which obscures clarity for the sake of style. There are instances of filter ("He was a portrait artist") and abstract phrasing that would benefit from more concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is severely marred by "text artifacts," specifically the verbatim repetition of "nervously confident" (four times) and "spongey dread" (three times). These mechanical loops act as significant distractors, damaging the story's rhythm and calling attention to the writing process.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from awkward integration of required phrases ("by scaffold wrap flutters" as a noun phrase). The repetition of the "sculpt possibility" motif feels artificial, and sentence rhythm is often flat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("tapestry of journeys," "armor of success"). There is minor reliance on scaffolding phrases to manage the timeline ("In the weeks that followed," "In the years that followed"), but line-level rhythm is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is marred by grammatical errors ("a strange healing properties") and reliance on clichés ("pieces fell into place," "pulsing dance"). The frequent use of filter verbs ("she witnessed," "she realized") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.8)
    Sentence variety is poor, with a monotonous cadence of Subject-Verb openers ("The druid stood," "The druid had always," "The druid took"). The prose relies on clichés ("time... frozen," "heaviest chain," "darkness and light") and repeats full phrases like "flesh-eating plant seed" without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "fine writing" artifacts, including abstract metaphors ("impossible weight," "blue and the absence of blue") and oxymoron pile-ups ("anxious elation"). The density of adjectives slows momentum and obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is marred by significant abstractions ("inlaying meaning everywhere the powder touched," "taste was of hope") that obscure the mechanics of the scene. The "fiercely gentle" oxymoron feels like a writing exercise artifact rather than an organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is marred by "seam and stitch" artifacts where prompt phrases are pasted in as grammatical subjects (e.g., "His motivation to discover purpose after loss ignited"). This results in clunky, abstract sentences that disrupt momentum and immersion. "Tell" statements replace active description frequently.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe proofreading failure with the inclusion of untranslated characters ("缩小") directly in the text creates a significant artifact penalty. Additionally, close-proximity word repetition ("departed/departed") and heavy use of filter/summary phrasing weaken the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by purple phrasing (&quot;gleaming like distant memories&quot;) and repetitive sentence structures (&quot;As [x]...&quot;). The mandatory phrase &quot;after tomorrow disappears&quot; is wedged in awkwardly as a noun phrase, disrupting the rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from adjective-noun stacking ("practiced caution," "latent radiance," "resonant hush") and clichéd phrasing ("dancing on glistening walls"). The required phrase "heartbeat of a hesitation" feels forced and syntactically awkward within the sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe artifacting due to the clumsy insertion of required phrases. "Daringly methodical," "truth-seeking river chronicler," and "bathroom graffiti wisdom" are repeated verbatim multiple times, creating a jarring, template-like cadence. This repetition breaks immersion and highlights the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "adjective-itis" and stock pairings ("mist-shrouded," "ethereal splendor," "silver-tongued," "fateful letters") that reduce freshness. While rhythmically competent, the reliance on abstract descriptors over concrete nouns creates a "purple" texture that slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting and repetition distract ("impossible color," "impossible speed," "constellations that shouldn't exist/never existed"). The prose relies on dense abstractions ("words tasting of mulberry ache") and filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of filter verbs ("She felt," "She let her mind") and abstract telling of emotion ("emotion was overwhelming"). The reliance on adjectives and standard metaphors ("ghostly thread," "perfect spark") flattens the imagery and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant repetition of specific noun phrases ("antique hairpin" x5, "vineyard hush" x3, "kindly decisive" x3) creates a template-like cadence and artifact drag. Unidiomatic usage ("steps scalloping," "thoughts scallop") breaks semantic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is competent but overly reliant on abstraction and adjective-heavy description ("soft weight of his perpetual state"). Metaphor stacking dampens clarity, and the use of oxymorons like "sincerely insincere" tells the reader what to feel rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.1)
    Line-level craft is marred by the aforementioned tense errors and repetitive phrasing ("sycamore hush" appears three times as a refrain; "weaves truth carefully" is repeated awkwardly). The prose relies on filter verbs ("saw," "watched") and abstract descriptors rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is functional but burdened by abstract nouns and expository scaffolding ("shimmer with newfound significance," "singular, almost absurd"). Several prompt elements are inserted via direct telling rather than integration into action ("He was historically reverent..."). Rhythm is generally smooth, but the reliance on summary prevents higher textural density.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from abstract telling ("refusal to conform to measurable properties") and explanatory scaffolding that dilutes density. Phrasing tends toward wordy definitions of magic rather than concrete imagery, reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but occasionally leans into purple phrasing ("tide's eternal dance," "soundless symphony") that softens the impact. The repetition of "meteor hush" feels like a forced tag rather than an organic description of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.5)
    High repetition of prompt phrases ("quietly enthusiastic," "ambered observatory deck," "foreign coins") creates a mechanical loop that stalls momentum. The usage of "distillated" reads as a lexical error that disrupts the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from high figurative density and simile overload ("cracked like an old wound," "like mist," "like a lover's sigh," "like frozen flames"). This "purple" tendency clutters the imagery and distances the reader. Additionally, filter verbs ("sought," "focusing," "remembering") occasionally dilute the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished but hindered by figurative density and adjective-heavy phrasing ("fractured rainbows," "cracked bronze surface," "earnest naive hope") that drags on momentum. Prompt phrases are inserted as literal text ("plausible impossibility") rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from abstract noun pairings ("anise and regret") and significant diction errors ("expunge" used to mean the opposite of its definition). These artifacts, combined with cliché phrasing like "bruised moon," obscure clarity and weaken the line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is fluid but reliant on abstract noun-adjective pairings ("impossible beauty," "hidden logic," "pure understanding") that tell rather than show. These abstractions flatten the texture and reduce the immediacy of the transformation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is suffocated by figurative density, with nearly every sentence containing a simile or metaphor ("like distant applause," "like fireflies," "like ghosts"). This "metaphor muddle" obscures the physical action and stalls momentum, replacing concrete detail with decorative abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by cliché ("grip like iron," "numbness cracking like old ice") and occasional diction errors (e.g., "fugue of disbelief"). The reliance on filter verbs and abstract descriptors for emotional states reduces the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level logic slips—specifically defining direct measurement tools as "orthogonal"—muddle the action. Frequent filter verbs ("He knew," "He thought," "He felt") dilute the immediacy of the encounter, turning the climax into a mental summary rather than a felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    The text contains multiple fatal mechanical errors that prevent publication, including "He conducting" (missing verb), "last peel" (homophone error for "peal"), and "break echo" (article fault). These lapses break the reader's immersion and fail the basic standard for a flawless final draft.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is competent but suffers from "overwriting" and abstract phrasing (e.g., "interiorizing exteriors," "impossibly coiled"). Adjective-heavy descriptions ("gray luminescence," "foggy lucidity") slow the momentum, and the reliance on telling ("Its story was too loud") reduces textual density.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level craft is significantly hampered by repetitive artifact insertions (e.g., "stoically sensitive" twice, "frozen bloom" twice, "successive approximation" three times). These repetitions feel mechanical and disrupt the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive naming artifacts; the full phrase "Hollywood star fragment" appears five times in a short text, creating a clunky, robotic rhythm that hinders flow. The phrase "shard of hush" is also repeated four times, feeling like a forced insertion rather than an organic description. These repetitions, along with opaque descriptors like "serenely electric," clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition (three uses of "resiliently positive," multiple uses of "interconnected patterns") and modifier clutter. The reliance on abstract "telling" ("defied conventional understanding," "impossible orchestra") prevents the reader from visualizing the concrete physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose has rhythm, it suffers from mixed metaphors and clichés that disrupt immersion. Phrases like "fingers dancing like a spider’s" are stock imagery, and "scent of ozone and closure" confuses sensory detail with abstract concepts, weakening the line-level precision. The dense adjectival phrasing occasionally slows the momentum unnecessarily.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally functional but suffers from "telling" emotions (e.g., "somber marvel") and clunky adjectival clusters. The repetition of "unfolded horizons" in both dialogue and narration feels repetitive rather than rhythmic. The technical description of the projector acts as a causality patch.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose is functional but marred by "text-artifact" repetition of prompt labels ("persistently curious" used twice as a static descriptor). The phrase "reeling hush" is inserted mechanically at the end. Phrasing often tells rather than shows ("defied logical explanation"), reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "saw") that distance the reader, and clichés ("electric serpents," "beautiful, terrible") that dull the imagery. Sentence structures are often repetitive, and the reliance on adjectives ("rhythmic warmth," "lazy reluctance") slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose rhythm is generally competent, but the opening sentence suffers from a jarring repetitive echo ("silent curtains... white silence"). The final paragraph acts as a summary/explanation of the story's meaning, which drags down the literary quality. There is also a tendency toward "template cadence" in the subject-verb sentence openers.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.6)
    Metaphor density occasionally obscures clarity (e.g., "liquid sound," "powdered memories"), creating purple prose that tells rather than shows. The reliance on similes for emotional weight weakens the immediacy of the physical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally evocative but suffers from noticeable repetition of specific terms ("coaxing" x3, "metamorphose" x2, "missing return changed" x3). These echoes read as checklist artifacts rather than organic motifs, creating drag in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition artifacts; the phrase "resonantly soft" appears five times, and "gap between knowing and understanding" three times, creating a heavy, looping cadence. Metaphor density is high ("music hummed through the city’s veins," "wind seemed to hoard"), often obscuring clarity for the sake of poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, particularly in the description of the "storm in a bottle." However, there is a tendency toward adjective stacking ("shimmering, lethal," "perfect, emotionless") and slightly heavy metaphorical phrasing ("monument to stillness") that creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is dense with abstract modifiers and clichés ("calloused fingers," "ghosts of circus performers," "language of light and shadow"). There is a reliance on telling through adjectives rather than showing through concrete action. Phrasing often prioritizes poetic cadence over clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is competent but laden with clichés ("living, breathing entities," "time was as fluid as verse") and abstract "of-constructions" ("calculus of poems," "harmonies of logic") that reduce impact. Information density is low regarding concrete reality, replaced by vague poetic assertions that stall momentum ("pulsing with the beat of analog memories").

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers significantly from "purple" overwriting, relying on cliché abstractions ("liquid memory," "shard of hope," "impossible beauty") and decorative adjective-noun pairings. This density of ornament obscures the action and robs the imagery of physical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but heavily reliant on abstract noun-adjective pairings (&quot;enveloped secrets,&quot; &quot;impossible color&quot;) and filter verbs (&quot;He felt,&quot; &quot;He saw&quot;). This tendency toward abstraction and &quot;purple&quot; description occasionally obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.2)
    A critical text artifact ("visited这个地方") appears in the second paragraph, signaling a major copy-edit failure. The prose frequently relies on abstract labels ("crisp nostalgia") instead of concrete imagery to convey emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but leans toward abstraction ("silence that settled like a second skin"). The verbatim repetition of the "hush as an empty playground swing" phrase in the final paragraph acts as a visible text artifact that disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and adjectival clutter ("thunderous roar," "profound silence," "soft, pearlescent light"). Abstract concepts are treated as concrete descriptions ("color of wonder," "hush of budding hope") without sufficient sensory grounding, and the rhythm is repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.9)
    The mandatory phrase "Across sharing the secret" is inserted with awkward syntax that breaks the prose rhythm twice, reading as a forced constraint. Abstract nouns are treated too concretely ("accumulated silence") without sufficient grounding in sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("ancient henge" appears six times; "methodically curious" and "map tears" multiple times) creates a stuttering, unpolished rhythm. The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("fractured parchment," "grainy footage") rather than strong verbs to drive the action.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant overwriting in the opening with heavy, stacked similes ("weight of a thousand unspoken goodbyes," "hollow as a shipwrecked bell"). Severe syntactic monotony (repetitive sentence starts) drags the pacing and distracts from the content.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.0)
    A typo in the opening sentence ("balladere") hurts immediate authority. The prose relies on abstract nouns and "telling" emotions ("filling him with a joy") rather than concrete imagery. Prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly as labels rather than integrated into the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from heavy telling and clunky modifier-noun pairs ("warmly inquisitive," "affectionate detachment") that clutter the line level without adding specificity. The rapid summary of the diary's contents ("accounts of secret airship flights... moments of rebellion") flattens potential scenes into lists. Physics logic breaks (reading a whole diary in seconds) disrupt suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacting; the phrase "quietly explosive" appears four times and "spooled wholeness" three times in a short space, creating a mechanical, template-like rhythm. The writing is overwrought (purple prose), prioritizing dense, abstract metaphors over clarity and momentum. These repetitions act as scaffold scars that obstruct the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant lexical repetition harms the prose: "fractally precise" (3x), "indentations" (6x), and "scholar's guild" (6x) indicate a lack of editing. The prose leans heavily on clichés ("whispering secrets," "hush before demolition") and abstract "purple" descriptors rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("spark of discovery," "breath caught in his throat," "vast unknown") and relies heavily on "telling" constructions. Sentence rhythm is sluggish, often burying the action under layers of explanatory modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.6)
    Repetitive use of full phrases ("clockmaker’s gear assortment," "rhythm of repair") creates a mechanical cadence that drags on momentum. The prose is functional but weighted down by these artifacts and abstract metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is mechanically functional but relies heavily on "telling" and time-compression scaffolding ("who would later be known," "They noticed patterns"). There is a lack of concrete action verbs and specific sensory details in favor of generalized reporting.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("nested patterns," "pane of hush," and "lullaby" each appear ~6 times) creates a distracting loop artifact. Overwriting with oxymorons ("perfect imperfections") and abstract noun piles further dilutes clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant text artifacts (Chinese characters "清晰的" and "晶体者") appear twice, rendering the text unpublishable in a literary context. These glitches, combined with the confusing "morning sickness" phrasing, constitute a major line-level failure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by awkward phrasing used to accommodate prompt strings ("timeframe she would later describe as 'as the pieces fall into place'"), which disrupts the rhythm. The text relies heavily on abstract telling ("grief... began to loosen") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from tautological phrasing ("bottles of bottled moonlight") and repetitive similes ("fragmented like..." appears three times). These artifacts, along with the forced repetition of prompt labels, create a stuttering rhythm that detracts from the intended lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by stock phrases and clichés ("pale moonlight," "heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird," "liquid mercury"). These artifacts flatten the emotional impact of otherwise interesting imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from awkward modifier stacking ("empathetically decisive fingers," "vigorous tender quality") and relies on telling-heavy summaries of impact. Timeline ambiguities and the clumsy insertion of prompt phrases disrupt the narrative flow and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures and oxymoronic descriptors ("chaotically precise") that clutter the imagery. Heavy reliance on abstract nouns and "to be" verbs slows the rhythm and reduces engagement. The repetition of prompt phrases (e.g., "through synaptic plasticity" appearing multiple times) creates a mechanical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is mechanically sound but dense with modifiers and abstract phrasing ("splinter perception into constituent colors") that slows momentum. There is a tendency toward "telling" the significance of objects rather than showing their impact through action. Phrase repetition (e.g., "prism-mind") borders on artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from heavy telling and lack of propulsion; crucial moments are summarized ("the effect was immediate") rather than rendered. The text relies on abstract nouns and explanations of internal states ("motive burned bright," "reverence") that distance the reader from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("painted the horizon," "map of the human heart") and abstract nouns ("beauty," "truth," "wisdom") that obscure concrete imagery. Sentence rhythm is repetitive, often relying on "noun-phrase + verb" structures that kill momentum. "Powerful emotions rose within him" is a prime example of telling instead of showing.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is laden with clunky modifier stacks ("intuitively descriptive mind") and clichés ("manufactured thunder"). Phrasing is repetitive (the phrase "theatrical yet... sincere" appears twice), and the sentence structure often relies on telling/summary rather than active scene construction.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("turning of the tide's thought" appears three times) and clunky word choices like "journalize" which disrupt the lyrical tone. These text artifacts and the tendency to summarize emotional states create a template-like cadence that dulls the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is polished but leans on clichés ("quest had just begun") and oxymorons that aren't unpacked ("whirling silence"). The auditory description contradicts the tonal claim of silence (hums, beeps, deafening echoes), creating a sensory disconnect.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive artifacts severely mar the prose; specific phrases ("rapidly adapting mind," "flight engineer's patch," "convergence points," "hazy precision") are repeated verbatim multiple times within a short word count. This creates a scaffolded, fill-in-the-blanks rhythm that disrupts immersion and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés and mixed metaphors ("fleeting cloud," "quiet fervor," "very marrow of existence," "kaleidoscope of sound and light"). Adjective stacking weakens the imagery (e.g., "cyanide-blue"—a chemical association that confuses rather than clarifies the color). The rhythm is monotonous, relying on declarative descriptions of sensory input without variation in cadence to match the supposed "urgency."

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose has rhythm but suffers from awkward phrasing ("wisdom-mongers" clashes with the high tone) and adjectival clutter. The climax relies on telling ("fabric of reality began to fray") rather than showing the specific mechanics of the magic, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies on clichéd abstract descriptors ("impossible geometries," "liminal space") and rhetorical list-making ("physics of feeling, chemistry of connection, calculus of compassion") that mimics depth without specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés and stock phrasing ("vanished like morning mist," "ribbon of liquid silver," "infinite night sky"). The density of adjectival padding slows momentum, and the description of the magic system ("air around him shimmered") lacks concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors ("humming with a patience that was almost tactile"). Abstract noun phrases ("hollow ache," "faint bitterness") replace concrete, specific imagery during the emotional climax. Several prompt phrases appear to be pasted in verbatim, creating textual artifacts that hinder immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from "template cadence" and repetition loops, with complex phrases like "raveling silence" (5x), "stoically sparkling" (3x), and "hush of time's unraveling tapestry" (3x) repeated verbatim. This renders the text repetitive and artificial, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetitive phrasing mars the prose; "azure defiance" appears four times and "quietly determined" twice in a short space, reading like forced prompt insertions. The specific phrase "time between understanding and confusion" is shoehorned awkwardly, disrupting the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is overwrought and dense with compound modifiers ("rust-eaten," "excavation-shattering"). Phrasing is often awkward or forced to accommodate prompts ("cyclically spontaneous," "murmur of half-remembered dreams"), creating rhythm bumps. The density of metaphors obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by stock adjective-noun pairings ("weathered tiller," "lone tower") and alliterative clichés ("tides and time"). The rhythm is lulling but lacks freshness or the sharp, specific imagery required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive phrasing ("total internal reflection" appears three times; "glass lantern wick" is repeated in full four times). These artifacts, combined with stock metaphors ("dissolved like seafoam"), create a mechanical rhythm that dulls the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished and smooth, with some striking images ("living event"). However, there are moments of overwriting—"detonated with light" feels hyperbolic for the established tone—and the text occasionally leans on "tell-heavy" phrasing to articulate concepts ("Elian called this quality iridescent caution") rather than showing them in action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but leans on abstract modifiers ("ethereal," "otherworldly") and filter verbs that distance the reader. The reliance on summary exposition stalls narrative momentum, preventing the scene work from generating density.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe template cadence issues; almost every sentence initiates with "The keeper" or "He," creating a monotonous rhythm. The prose is dense with adjective-noun pairings ("muted vitality," "hollowed-out tunes") that stall momentum without adding causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is competent but frequently overwritten with abstract phrasing that obscures imagery ("confidant to her hesitation," "enlarged by tranquility"). These constructions prioritize poetic sounding labels over concrete sensory details, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose rhythm is generally competent, but the text suffers from "prompt-itis," inserting required terms as awkward modifiers ("through guerrilla gardening," "creeping normality noticer") that clash with the fable-like register. Figuration occasionally drifts into purple prose ("delicate weight of a miracle") that obscures rather than clarifies the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant text-loop artifacts appear throughout the prose. The phrase "gently meticulous" is repeated three times as a fixed epithet, and "magic lantern slide" appears frequently without variation. These repetitive scaffolds interrupt the flow and give the writing a template-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is weighed down by scaffolding artifacts ("For her second attempt," "implementing her last false start") that kill narrative momentum. Clichés ("distant thunder," "security blanket") and filter verbs ("noticed," "found herself") dilute the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("terrestrially cosmic" appears twice) and a reliance on abstract descriptors ("emotional meteorology"). Synesthetic descriptions are vivid but risk becoming lists rather than integrated experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("ghosts of faces," "uncork the creativity") and mixed metaphors. Repetitive phrasing ("He rose... He rose again") and heavy adjectival layering obscure clarity and stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies on clichés ("hands trembled," "morning's first light") and abstract telling ("crushing weight of withheld truths"). There is a lack of sensory immediacy, with adverbs and explanations doing the work that concrete imagery should.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is marred by objective errors ("a open-air," "butfelt") and the distraction-inducing hyphenation of "glisten-ing" and "glisten-ed" throughout the text. Heavy reliance on repetitive abstract phrases and template sentence structures creates a sluggish, artifact-laden rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is generally competent but marred by the specific repetitive artifact "strangely organic," which appears four times in a short text. This repetition disrupts the reading flow and suggests a lack of lexical variety in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose is significantly overwritten ("courtyard... was his canvas," "brushstroke in the masterpiece of healing"), prioritizing ornamental metaphors over clarity and physical grounding. This density of abstract imagery slows momentum and results in "purple prose" that obscures the actual events of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is serviceable but marred by "telling" emotional states ("showing no fear") and occasional purple phrasing ("ballet of decryption"). There is a reliance on explaining the significance of actions rather than letting the dramatization carry the weight, and the mechanics of the scene are often asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is competent but marred by clichés ("salt and sorrow," "prayer beads") and repetitive phrasing ("gleaming silence" appears twice). The writing relies on summary and telling ("The method had come to her in a dream") to advance the plot, bypassing opportunities for dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of specific phrases ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic," "nocturnal haven") that appear algorithmic and forced. Overwriting is prevalent, with dense, mixed metaphors ("silence shaped like a blade," "shards," "frayed rope") that obscure clarity. These repetitive text artifacts fundamentally break the immersive quality required for literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("curiosity sharper than any blade," "lie smooth as aged parchment," "knowing stars"). The mid-sentence explanation of the location shift creates a stumbling block in the rhythm at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and flows well, with strong imagery in the garden descriptions. There is a tendency toward slightly purple modifiers ("tragically radiant," "impossible recognition") that distance the reader from the immediate physical action, but the line-level craft is generally solid.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetition of prompt phrases creates a checklist feel; "heritage rose thorn" appears four times in full, which is clunky. The "Marvel" typo ("Lord Valerius's solicitor, who Marvel consulted") is a jarring line-level error. Adverb-heavy phrasing ("wisely endured") weakens the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose leans toward the "purple" side with dense, sometimes mixed metaphors ("breath steeped the canyon air with truth") and stock phrasing ("gilded halls," "webs of intrigue"). The density of adjectives slows the pacing without always adding clarity or distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but relies on summary ("she always weaves truth carefully") rather than dramatized scene work. Clichés like "shattered like ice" and "calloused hands" dilute the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.3)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive loops, using the prompt phrases "scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" three times each as fixed labels. This lazy repetition creates a drumbeat of "telling" that destroys line-level momentum and violates the artifact screen.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from summary at pivotal moments ("began the meticulous process") and telling ("intuit what had really happened"). These shortcuts rob the narrative of density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by clutter like "lyrically prophetic words" (telling, not showing) and the repetition of the epithet "the lonely visionary." These artifacts create a slight distance from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("crystalline clarity," "frayed rope") and abstract metaphors ("color of regret," "honey of what might otherwise have been lost"). The mandatory phrases ("positively wistful recognition," "gleaned redemption") are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting ("hues of fire and forgiveness," "ancient, waiting silence") and abstract metaphor. A likely typo or confused proper noun ("Mariana itself" used in reference to the marina) disrupts immersion, and the density of adjectives slows the pacing without adding informational value.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.1)
    Competent mechanics are marred by clichés ("second nature," "restless spirit") and purple prose ("captured star"). The repetition of "softly purposeful movements" across two paragraphs stalls momentum and highlights the prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe overwriting and high metaphor density stifle the prose; nearly every sentence carries a simile ("like a pendulum," "like puppets," "like roots," "like a file"), creating a "purple prose" effect that obscures clarity. The text relies on template cadence and cliché ("breathed a collective sigh," "shiver down her spine").

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by forced prompt insertions ("moved with an aptly deliberate pace") and reliance on clichés ("breath held tight," "chill ran down," "finality"). These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and prevent the writing from reaching a professional polish.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "Throughout the evolution" begins three separate paragraphs, and "steadily curious" and "acid sea" recur excessively. These loops suggest a lack of revision and disrupt narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose relies heavily on stock phrases and clichés ("ghost in the machine," "breadcrumb trail," "Rosetta Stone," "jagged scar"). The narrative mode is predominantly summary/telling, which reduces immediacy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive epithets and phrasing artifacts; "weighted breath" appears four times, and "shadow-laced" and "calm intuition" are overused. The reliance on abstract nouns ("impossible beauty," "accumulated empathy") creates a density of telling that stalls momentum and obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished with good rhythmic variance. However, distinct clichés like reality slipping "like sand" and the capitalization of abstract nouns detract from the freshness. The density is good, though the final paragraph leans heavily on explanation rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures (frequent Noun-Verb openings) and a reliance on clichés ("words hung in the air like a melody," "spark from the past"). Abstract labels frequently replace concrete, sensory description.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive phrasing (the phrase "The line walker" appears over a dozen times) and a monotonous Subject-Verb sentence structure ("The line walker moved," "He adjusted," "He paused"). This "drumbeat rhythm" and the recycling of prompt phrases ("strangely honest," "kinetic parapet") create a mechanical feel that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from clichés ("discordant symphony," "tapestry of resilience") and purple description. Crucially, the inclusion of the prompt instruction ("earnest whimsy") directly within the diegesis creates a jarring meta-artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is functional and often evocative, it relies too heavily on stock metaphors at pivotal moments ("seeping into his bones," "mind's eye," "heart a slow, heavy drum," "symphony of an ending"). These clichés dilute the otherwise distinct imagery and lower the ceiling for line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose creates a strong mood but suffers from reliance on stock phrasing ("silent witnesses," "reverence that bordered on prayer," "abandoned bones") and adjective-heavy telling ("absurdly difficult"). Tighter editing to remove these clichés and filter verbs ("he felt the pull") would sharpen the imagery significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is marred by redundancy ("changelessly constant") and mixed metaphors ("escape velocity... was a countdown"). The reliance on abstract noun phrases and cliché ("unshed tears," "frenetic blur") obscures clarity, and the repetition of the "luminous ache" phrase functions as a static frame rather than a developing motif.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is competent but marred by purple phrasing ("pulsing stillness," "hovered like a radiant haven") and abstract descriptions. "Hymning the mundane" is used awkwardly as a verb phrase, drawing attention to the writing rather than the action. The text relies on adjectives and stated emotions rather than strong verbs and concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent but marred by stock imagery and clichés ("liquid smoke," "shattered glass," "older than memory"). The phrase "literally and metaphorically" is a scaffold that weakens the description of the runes. While there are no major mechanical errors, the language lacks the fresh, specific texture required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from repetitive descriptors ("starlight" appears four times; "impossible" three times) and reliance on abstract adjectives over concrete verbs. Phrases like "manacles of starlight" and "impossible botany" do heavy lifting that specific description should handle. The rhythm is smooth, but the density of "filter" verbs (felt, knew, saw) dampens the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=1.5)
    Fatal text artifacts and looping severely damage readability. The phrase "zephyr bloom" is misused as a noun four times; "serpentine" appears five times. The prompt phrase "memories resurface" is pasted verbatim twice, and a typo ("began weigh") further erodes quality.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.5)
    The phrase "honeyed hush" repeats four times in a short space, creating a distracting scaffold loop. Dialogue is stiff and unnatural, and phrases like "quiet proactivity" rely on telling rather than showing action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by adjectival density and "purple" abstractions ("molten silver forming impossible geometry," "retreating like shy animals"). Phrases like "impossible geometry" and "vibrations traveling up his arm" read as common generative artifacts or clichés. The reliance on similes to describe the setting often obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetition artifacts dominate the prose: "harvest moon" (x7), "vine tendril" (x6), and "gathering hush" (x4) appear incessantly within a short text. This synonym lock creates a mechanical, looping rhythm that dulls clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.0)
    Significant repetition artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "demonstrating patience physically" appears almost verbatim in two different paragraphs, reading as a loop/placeholder. This redundancy creates a drag on the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from abstract overwriting and mixed metaphors ("emotional architecture," "cellar of reason"). The density of abstract nouns (essence, resonance, wonder) without counterbalancing concrete verbs results in a lack of physical solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is severely hampered by the clumsy, repetitive insertion of full prompt phrases ("kerosene lamp burner" x4, "boundary-lessly trapped" x3, "whalebone reverie" x2). These repetitions create a mechanical cadence and obvious scaffold artifacts that disrupt the narrative flow and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but dense with adjectival clutter ("autumnal rust-hued peace," "low, promising rumble"). There is a reliance on telling disguised as description. Several phrases feel like prompt-insertions ("hauntingly practical," "crystallized time") rather than organic stylistic choices, and the rhythm is somewhat monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant repetitive artifacts ("resolute" x3, "fractured stillness" x3) and clunky phrasing ("chronologically confused time") mar the prose. The sentence rhythm is monotonous, often relying on identical subject-verb openings that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("maze of intentions" appears four times; "stoic wonder" three times) indicates a lack of line-level control. The prose leans heavily on abstract metaphors and purple description ("trickle of water that smelled of rust and memory") that obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetition of multi-word phrases ("glacial hush" x3, "excruciatingly gently" x3, "introverted clock scribe" x3) creates a robotic, template-like rhythm. The prose leans into purple abstractions ("orchestra of possibility") that obscure rather than reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from heavy telling and abstract labeling in key beats ("This profound hindsight clarity recontextualized everything"). Reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("serene upheaval," "unyielding promise") slows momentum. The climax is summarized emotionally rather than shown through concrete action or sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is overwritten with strained metaphors ("lightning’s frozen scream") and heavy adjective density that slows momentum. The phrase "oceanic hush" repeats at the opening and closing, creating a lexical loop rather than a resonant callback.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from abstraction ("essence of lives," "geography of healing") that reduces concrete impact. The simile at the climax ("words wove together like the carpet thread") feels slightly convenient and ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=3.2)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacts. The phrase "quaking reverie" appears four times (often semantically incorrectly), "flawed genesis" three times, and "painfully sweet" twice within a very short word count. These loops distract significantly from the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is overwrought and reliant on abstractions ("evidence of her creed," "foundation of her argument"). Mixed metaphors and clichés ("scars could sing," "notes in a symphony") clutter the text. The density of adjectives and "tell" statements impedes momentum and reduces the impact of the physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=2.9)
    Repeated grammatical errors involving the prompt word ("unstick its stubborn lock," "had unstick himself") severely damage line-level credibility. The prose suffers from high metaphor density and adjective clutter that obscures causality and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    A critical artifact ("Canada edges") suggests a lack of basic proofreading. Phrasing is often clichéd ("hues of dying stars," "darkness carry it onward") or awkward ("strands of photon"), failing the standard for flawless literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is heavily burdened by "purple" descriptors, mixed metaphors, and oxymorons ("thundering calm," "fiercely meditative"). The reliance on abstract noun phrases ("shape of collective grief," "spectral mentorship") and cliché similes ("coiled like a dormant serpent") obscures the action and violates the economy standard.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense with adjectival stacking ("slow, heavy, and impossibly steady") and cliché phrases ("breath held by time itself," "aging brass heart"). The reliance on abstract nouns ("clarity," "devotion," "penance") to carry weight dilutes the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally smooth and descriptive, but tonal clashes disrupt the atmosphere; terms like "meta-narrative," "causal chains," and "echo-systems" feel clinically modern against the antique, sovereign-case aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés and mixed metaphors ("tears of joy," "silence settle like snow," "ink flowed like a river"). The reliance on "X was Y" scaffolding and abstract descriptors ("fractured shards," "web of probabilities") creates an overwritten texture that lacks concrete grounding. Line-level precision is sacrificed for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose leans heavily on cliché and purple phrasing ("choked the world’s imagination," "lifeline," "defied the famine"). The phrase "thistled calm" appears to be a malapropism (likely intending "thistledown") that clashes with the subsequent description of gentleness, disrupting the line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.1)
    Line-level craft is hampered by clichés ("delicate as butterfly wings") and the mixing of abstract nouns with sensory verbs ("smelled of dust and regret"). Filter verbs ("Elias knew," "Elias believed") dilute the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=2.0)
    A severe text artifact renders a central sentence illegible to the target audience. The prose is also marred by the verbatim repetition of descriptive phrases ("rationally rebellious" appears three times; "abrasive calm" twice) and a reliance on summary over scene.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from adjectival clutter ("expectant resignation," "perfect steadiness") and abstract phrasing that distances the reader. Phrases like "grasp across unlearning hatred" are grammatically awkward and appear forced to fit constraints. The density of "tell" over "show" slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "adjectivitis" and abstract descriptions ("cosmic resonance," "miniature galaxy") that soften the physical reality of the scene. The reliance on time-compression summary ("Days passed") flattens the rhythmic potential and momentum of the line-level writing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose leans into purple phrasing ("nectar dusk’s soft lament") and clichés ("whisper of the wind," "city's lost soul") that flatten the texture. Line-level momentum is stalled by explanatory clauses that tell the reader how to interpret the action ("a genuine, unguarded expression that his curse allowed").

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from clunky nominalizations ("creeping normality noticer's instinct") and abstract wordiness. Reliance on "tell" phrasing to explain the magic system ("doctrine that moving something...") dilutes the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, but the "template cadence" artifact in the realization sequence ("He saw... He felt... He perceived...") disrupts the flow and creates a list-like effect during a peak moment. Additionally, the narrative relies on abstract summaries ("lazy, sentient indifference," "profound respect they struggled to articulate") where concrete details would have been more forceful.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from awkward adverbial phrasing ("balancedly daring") and a reliance on abstract metaphors ("texture of a missed opportunity," "tapestry of numbers"). There is a high density of "telling" sentences that summarize internal states instead of evoking them. The phrase "balancedly daring" stands out as a forced inclusion that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally competent and rhythmic, but suffers from cliché ("roadmap of sorrows," "soft as moths’ wings") and repetitive phrasing ("saffron quiet" appears twice in a short span). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("She felt," "She saw," "She realized") that distances the reader from the immediate experience of the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the rhythm is generally solid, the prose is marred by distinct clichés like "precision of a surgeon" and "practiced grace" which lower the literary quality. The repetition of "rosewater" works as a structural frame, but the specific stock metaphors in descriptive beats are a drag on the score.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose has momentum, it suffers from synonym churn (e.g., "slow exhale... dying breath") and adjective-heavy scaffolding that tells rather than shows significance ("latent radiance," "promise of power"). These artifacts dampen the immediacy of the high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is functional but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("photographically cursed" appears four times) and clichéd descriptors ("dying star," "repulsive allure"). The integration of the prompt word "unbosom" feels awkward and forced within the sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is marred by visible typos ("orchust," "fulfiiting") and overwrought abstractions ("cosmic sonic origami," "stillescence"). The reliance on purple phrasing and forced technical terminology creates a cluttered, opaque texture that obscures the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is serviceable but marred by adverbs ("feverishly," "quietly") and clichés ("sweltering afternoon," "trembling hands") that blunt the impact. The discovery scene relies on "tell" rather than "show," describing the mechanism of the crack and the parchment in a functional, list-like manner.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is functional but laden with "purple" descriptors and clichés ("breath misted," "groan echoing," "eyes pleading"). The writing tells more than it shows, often explaining the emotional weight of a moment instead of letting the action carry it. Sentence structures are repetitive during the action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.2)
    Three distinct grammatical errors using "wrest" as a past participle ("had wrest," "been wrest") create jarring causality breaks and disrupt the reading flow. Phrasing like "firm shore surveyor" and "pavilionward" reads as unnatural and clumsy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from adverb-heavy telling ("carefully heated," "carefully readjusted," "miraculously survived," "miraculously readable") and repetitive phrasing. The prompt elements ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled") are pasted in awkwardly, creating distinct text artifacts that disrupt the rhythm and feel forced.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and vivid ("thousands fragile rainbows," "soft click"). A slight deduction for the somewhat mechanical insertion of prompt elements ("His motivation was plain...", "The attribute... was a cruel paradox"), which reads as scaffold rather than organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear but marred by abstract telling ("anticipatory horror and ecstasy") and clichés ("familiar cocktail"). Phrases like "intangibly tangible" and "relay-sensitive hearts" feel overwrought, reducing the density and impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose leans into "purple" description ("sliced through the brilliant dimness," "drink the fading light") that obscures clarity for the sake of atmosphere. Abstract metaphors ("living creatures dancing," "heat haze with purpose") clutter key moments. The repetition of the phrase "brilliant dimness" and "perpetually surprised" reads as a repetitive artifact rather than a rhythmic device.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from significant word-echo artifacts (five uses of "cobalt," three of "sieved hush") that break immersion. Filter verbs ("felt," "wondered," "watched") distance the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    Competent sentence structure is weighed down by abstract "telling" and purple prose ("liminal space," "furrowed hush"). Metaphor density slows momentum, and "satellite uniforms" reads as a logic/phrasing artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from abstraction and clunky metaphors ("Backlash of regret needed no formal validation for consumption"). Several phrases feel like "writerly" intrusions (e.g., "expectations had collapsed like dying stars") that reduce immediacy and density. The required phrases are inserted somewhat awkwardly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional and rhythmic but marred by stock metaphors ("smooth as glass," "festered like wounds," "shimmered like heat"). These clichés reduce the vividness of the imagery and signal a reliance on familiar phrasing over fresh observation. The sentence structures are competent, but the density of abstract nouns ("paradox," "empathy," "violence") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and cliché ("soft as whispers," "burned themselves into her soul," "cosmic eyes"); the reliance on abstract modifiers dilutes the imagery and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose has momentum but is marred by repetitive, imprecise descriptors (the word "impossible" is used three times to modify nouns; "ethereal" appears twice in close proximity). These lexical loops and stock metaphors ("liquid mercury") degrade the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from filter verbs ("Elara felt," "Elara knew") and abstract telling. A distinct phrasing artifact appears with "ghostly resolve" used twice (paragraphs 4 and 6), which creates a repetitive loop that flattens the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is overwritten with adjectival clutter ("rhythmic light," "vibrant hush," "intoxicating") that slows momentum. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a pattern of abstract assertion followed by explanation. The dialogue is staged and unnatural, serving as a vehicle for thematic announcements rather than character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.9)
    Phrasing is often clunky ("vigilante lock sentinel") and relies on "telling" ("a trait that had served her well"). The prose lacks rhythmic variety and frequently resorts to explanatory scaffolding that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by adjective stuffing ("cryptic symbols," "methodical precision," "residual cosmic energy"). The reliance on stock fantasy phrasing dulls the imagery, and the line-level description frequently contradicts the frictionless physics established in the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is competent but weighed down by abstract nouns and clichés ("fractured the sky," "liminal space"). The phrase "storm-kissed wonder" and the label "furiously tranquil" read as forced insertions rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, suffering from a density of strained similes and clichés ("whirring like a philosophical argument," "laugh... like shattering glass," "velvet-covered blade"). These text artifacts obscure the action and create a melodramatic tone that clashes with the intellectual premise. Filter verbs ("Elias knew," "Elias saw") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.4)
    The text contains visible artifacts ("like_consts", "on_dirty") and relies on dense abstraction ("nurtured both Maya's friendship") over concrete scene work. The prose frequently slips into rhetorical template patterns ("Whatever... they would") that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.4)
    Purple prose dominates ("notes dissolving," "day bled into night"), and the phrase "smelled of... forgotten dreams" is a sensory abstraction failure. "Strategically creative" is a clumsy tell that disrupts immersion, and the text relies on adjective-noun clusters rather than strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive use of specific, awkward phrases ("luminous doubt" appears three times; "empirically whimsical" twice) which read like forced prompt insertions. Mixed metaphors ("ticking clock built from clouds") and abstract adjectives dilute clarity. The line-level craft relies on adornment rather than precision.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from metaphor congestion and overwriting. Mixing "magnetic fields," "tides," "stitches," and "roots" within a short space creates conceptual muddle rather than clarity. Phrases like "rhythmically placid grace" are contradictory and clunky, and the text relies on abstract descriptors ("color of unspoken apologies") where concrete imagery would be stronger.

    High information density: each sentence advances image, emotion, or concept; no scaffold, no paraphrase loops. Metaphors (wisteria as “silent prayers”) are sparse, mixed only once (“weight of unexplored dimensions”) but do not tangle the closure beat. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Proofing clean; pronouns unambiguous. One filter-verb cluster (“he noticed,” “he felt”) appears in a calm beat, not under peak pressure, so no 9+ disqualifier. Ear-test passes—read aloud, the cadence breaths with the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the halo fragment’s energy binding him to the past” simultaneously reveals lore and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor is single-use and physically coherent—“ribbons in a storm” survives because bridges literally ribbon. Information density peaks in the halo-tree paragraph where light, eruption, and burnt palm converge in three lines. Final line’s oxymoron (“beautifully empty”) lands as precise closure, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong verbs and sensory nouns (“fletching woven from bark,” “chains clanking like funeral bells”) keep immediacy. Three adjacent sentences begin with “The…” early on, a minor template cadence (−0.2). Mixed metaphors avoided; figurative language spikes in density around peak decoding but pattern is taught and paid off. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops; information density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence mirrors tidal creaks and aurora ripples; sentence length varies to match listening intensity. Figurative layering is patterned and purposeful, not ornamental overload. No synonym loops; “forge,” “ember,” “absence” recur with accruing weight. Only micro-slips: “the sound of trust breaking” phrase repeats twice near end; a fresher inflection could heighten final sting, but artifact does not touch closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    Figurative language is dense but patterned: “shadow painted in honey,” “liquid starlight”; taught early and revisited at closure without muddle. One paraphrase loop: “golden hour was gone, but its light lingered” slightly restates prior sentence; −0.2. Otherwise high density, varied rhythm, no scaffold. No artifact touches the closure beat; remains eligible for 9+ but density keeps at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud ear varied: long breathy sentences for melt, staccato for shock. Information density high—“cracked leather bookmark” does triple duty: tactile, symbolic, plot device. One mixed metaphor: “weighty lightness” repeated but justified as thematic oxymoron. Zero loops, no scaffold. Final line recharges “winter’s snow” motif without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory density is high but purposeful; no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. However, three near-identical “seashell whispered” phrases within 100 words create a template cadence that dulls the climax beat. Minor overwrite in peak beat keeps the score sub-7.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense, doubling action with image: “scratch of his quill moving across delicate gold pages, each stroke a small rebellion” performs characterization and stakes in one breath. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay within night-cartography logic (stars as candles, darkness as architecture). One minor paraphrase loop (“ambered hush” twice within four sentences) nudges repetition, but the pattern is purposeful rather than scaffold. Overall clarity and cadence support the ceremonial close without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence openings, natural paragraph cadence; high information density—each line advances image or causality. No mixed metaphors; “crystalline frost,” “fractured rainbows” stay within physics of ice/light. Scaffold-free; no loops or synonym churn. One minor register lift—“feverish hope”—but justified by Thorne’s remembered intensity. Otherwise diction stays concrete, verbs strong (“swept,” “scraping,” “sizzling”). Copy-clean; pronouns unambiguous. Final line resolves by image, recharging “loops” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates from long torrential sentences to final short sips; information dense; no scaffold loops; mixed metaphors (“shoulders knotting like tangled thread”) slightly strained (-0.2); legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear is supple: syntactic variety mirrors the vine twists. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative control: “blooming withering balance” risks oxymoron but pays off when the garden literally blooms its own decay into architecture. Information-dense without crowding: one sentence slips dew, seeds, and secrecy into a single polish motion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and entry angle; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is disciplined—only two metaphors (“blanket of wings,” “captured auroras”) and both serve atmosphere without purple inflation. Information density is high: each lever beat advances knowledge and stakes simultaneously. A single paraphrase loop (“mechanically warm” surfaces twice in four lines) nicks perfection; removing one instance would sharpen propulsion. Otherwise copy is clean, pronouns unambiguous, and paragraph cuts tight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long sentences for submersion, clipped fragments for discovery. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “water damage creating images” is repeated almost verbatim three times; trimming one would tighten. Otherwise clean, propulsive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“the fever hadn’t been an illness but a violent inoculation, a statement she had been forced to embody”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (weight as gravity, absence as void). Rhythm breathes with the fever-break pacing. Minor near-repeat of “weight” thematic word twice in one paragraph, but the second use is reweighted by “gravitational pull,” so only hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with the flashlight arc, then shortens into staccato kneel-turn-sigh, propelling the beat. Information density high: each sentence does two jobs (setting + interiority, or action + metaphor). Figurative layering is controlled—only three metaphors in the climax—so no overload penalty. Persistent minor scaffold: “the frantic voice…frantic callers…frantic admission” creates synonym churn that dulls the final sigh; keeps score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Density is high—single sentences layer time, decay, and metaphysics without scaffold. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; every metaphor is internally consistent (obsidian as memory strata, silence as living presence). One mixed vehicle—“language decay and rebirth itself in cycles”—is forgivable at this length. Clause rhythm varies; no template cadence, and the final image lands clean, propelling the thematic reprice.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences during harp flow, staccato fragments as moon bites sun. No synonym churn; “curl” always “curl,” never lock or tress. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors in 800 words, each paying off (roots as rivers, music as bridge, eclipse as halo). Filter verbs minimal; perception direct: “she touched the locket,” not “she felt herself touching.” Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive; no scaffolding or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with the excavation beats; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is selective: “embers refusing to die” charges the dragon image without crowding. High information density—each sentence layers history, tool, or sensory cue. A single mixed metaphor (“sediment in stone” applied to emotional resonance) is minor enough to leave 9-band eligibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, tool, and motive. Metaphors stay coherent—light as metronome, strings of ink—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Filter-verb clusters are minimal; action verbs dominate. A few template cadences (“signal one… signal two”) echo spy-protocol rhythm purposefully, not mechanically. No loops or scaffold obscure causality, keeping closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density lyric: every sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned—silence as paint, loop as prayer—and pays off in the final dissolving stroke. One paraphrase loop: “the silence returned, heavier now” echoes earlier “silence…thick” within 40 words; the second could compress. Otherwise, cadence breathes with the pedal presses, no algorithmic drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, Stakes, and bodily cost (“The cold seeping through his thin slippers as he traced the nautilus curve”). Metaphors are few, precise, anchored—“crooked smile” crack, “pearly light” in shell. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either ascent or memory map. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward dawn then fractures in the final short clause “He slid to the floor.”

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; most sentences advance image or pressure. Occasional micro-loop: “the darkness brightened again” appears twice with only slight rephrasing, dulling the second impact. Metaphors stay coherent—neon “veins,” viaduct “humming”—and never stack into purple. Strong paragraph cut-test: removing any middle paragraph would erase a causal loop or sensory anchor, so none feel scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level density: one sentence conducts three jobs—e.g., “She pressed her palm flat against the spinning record, feeling the jagged journey of the needle as a frantic, buzzing text” shows action, tactile metaphor, and stakes. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; each adjective earns place. Figurative logic stays physical: “buzzing text” marries sound-as-touch to literary trope without rupture. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“defiantly beating heart”) that recharges “filament” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and vivid, but figurative layering (“ancient stone walls absorbed the city’s noise like a sponge”) clusters in early paragraphs without later payoff. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; metaphors stay coherent. Register drifts slightly elevated (“conceptual repricing of solitude”) yet fits Elias’s intellect. Closing paragraph achieves clean propulsion; minor over-writing earlier keeps it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds sensory or causal information. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“crystal shadows,” “phantom shimmer”) and peaks only after the UV switch is thrown, avoiding purple overload. Strong verbs—unfurl, coalesce, seal—propel momentum. Copy-clean: no tense drift, no pronoun ambiguity, no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, forward push—yet avoid purple overload by staying grounded in touch and dust. One paraphrase loop: “time’s texture revealed itself to be woven...” restates the already-imaged tapestry. Mixed metaphor alert—“origami made of twilight”—is fleeting and doesn’t tangle closure. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive; final knot image lands with snap.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the wood beneath her feet still damp from the evening mist” seeds both sensorial ground and later bowl resonance. Metaphors are few but precise: shipwrecks as “broken elders” concisely elders the world. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each clause advances image or pressure. A single soft spot—“the grace of things left undone” edges toward maxim—yet its brevity keeps purple risk minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences often advance atmosphere, character, and stake simultaneously (“blotter petal…key, memory holder”). No paraphrase loops; each return to the petal adds new charge. Figurative language is controlled—three metaphors in 750 words, each paying off. Minor register lift (“resonant reconfiguration”) is allowable at climax. Final line is propulsive and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: one sentence often performs description, characterization, and thematic nudge (“ignored it, tonight belonging to connections measured not in profit margins”). Metaphors stay coherent—sea fog, falling leaves, shipping routes—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Minor template cadence (“she… she…”) appears mid-page but does not touch closure. Filter verbs are sparse; strong verbs (“buzzed,” “stirring”) propel momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between fluid lyrical cadence and sharp percussive beats (“We’re home”). Figurative language is dense but patterned—light, reeds, tag—each revisited and reweighted, avoiding decorative overload. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “luminescence” recurs with accruing meaning, not filler. Opening and final lines serve as sonic brackets, propelling without hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line economy is high: every sentence at minimum advances atmosphere or causality; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent—time as thread, canal as map, echoes as seeds—and do not stack into purple density. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic sentences for borrowed-time stretches, staccato fragments as collapse begins. Only micro-slip: "something immense shifting" is slightly generic, but it is immediately re-specified as "the sleeping giant’s exhale."

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet aerated—each sentence performs dual labor (atmosphere + causality). Figurative layer is controlled: only one sustained metaphor cluster (mathematics = grief map) and it pays off. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Final third is clean—no artifact touches closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward silence-then-shift without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; sentences advance stealth, scent, or emotional calculus. Occasional lyrical clustering (“sapphire hush,” “aged bones”) flirts with overwriting but serves pattern, not clutter. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; final line lands clean. High-band but not artifact-free enough for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentences carry double duty: “His diagrams failed him; the leaf’s behavior was too chaotic” couples internal state with external fact. Figurative language is spare, storm-tested—”stem a taut wire vibrating” is precise, not purple. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from measured botanist cadence to wind-driven staccato, mirroring surrender. Line integrity intact: no typos, no tense drift, no buried lead.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, image, theme—without scaffolding; openings vary; paragraph cuts are clean. Metaphors mostly coherent (“tides of what came after”) though “universe is but layers of experience compressed” edges toward pseudo-profundity. No loops or paraphrase stacks; high density. One participle opener simultaneity slip (“pressing something cool… fingers traced”) is forgivable at this tempo. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry dual duty (“The steadily unpredictable nature of these shadow doorways fascinated her—they appeared and vanished…”). No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold spot: “containment and boundlessness simultaneously” circles a concept already visible in the iridescence. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and aligned with lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long tidal rolls to short brittle clauses (“this was the valve that broke”), mirroring the move from longing to fracture. Occasional modifier stacks—“mist-shrouded ivory harbor after rain”—risk purple but stay within POV’s sensuous archive eye. No paraphrase loops; however, “acknowledged and understood” is mild tautology that could compress. Otherwise crisp propulsion, high density, zero artifact interference with closure.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Freshest inflection: exile memorialized via broken musical part rather than intact relic—absence literally engineered into the archive. Staggered-interval revelation method is non-obvious yet inevitable given the community’s trauma saturation. Risk is taken in rejecting restorative climax; the payoff is a conceptual repricing rather than emotional purge. Could edge higher if the harbor’s ivory had cracked under the weight of withheld stories, literalizing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are few and coherent—mist as shroud, spires as needles—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies: opening clause-chain gives way to fragment bursts at gate breach. Minor scaffold: “the arrows ahead glowed faintly, their light pulsing like a lantern at the end of a tunnel” re-states visibility already implied; paraphrase loop triggers −0.2. No template cadence, no artifact in final third, so 9+ not disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong density—most lines do setting + interior + metaphor simultaneously. One paraphrase loop: “unheard symphony” repeated three times with identical phrasing; clipped 0.2. Mixed but functional metaphor—“cascade of light and sound”—doesn’t violate physics. No scaffolding; opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Punctuation and tense remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each metaphor extends the prism/void motif without mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length to mimic field oscillation. Minor over-modification in “silent, beautiful violence” is the only hairline slip, but it occurs pre-peak and does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong density—sentences perform double duty: “deathly vitality of the prep room” marries atmosphere and theme. Minimal scaffolding; no synonym loops. One mixed-image risk: “mathematics of a fair trade” is abstract but saved by immediate tactile context of the ink application. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with punchy clauses under pressure. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the pot hand-off carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear is musical without drumbeat: sentence lengths wax and wane like the lamp’s warming cycle. Information density excels—one sentence often embeds tool, sensorium, and emotional calculus (“metallic surface, activating the history he had cultivated”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines act as harmonic brackets, returning to dawn light and gold glow to propel rather than decorate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory ground, metaphoric lift, and forward motion—“the port was a graveyard of voices, and he was its sole undertaker.” No scaffold; every paragraph shifts knowledge or emotional charge. Figurative surplus is present but patterned (container-“canyons,” “steel monoliths”) and justified by the POV’s mosaic lens. A single mixed vehicle—“corrugated walls” beside “canyons”—keeps the score south of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings rotate. Information density high—“decaying dome where telescopes had once reached for the stars” does world + character in one stroke. No synonym loops; figurative language spare, no mixed metaphors. One scaffold near “gloomy cheerfulness” repeated twice; minor −0.2. Closure sentence (“inside the whisper of closing pages, he had found…”) lands clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, high density: “salt and sweat of generations” compresses history. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare, vehicles stay coherent. One mixed metaphor flickers—“armor” of aesthetics vs. “buoyant” soul—yet doesn’t cloud causality. Final line drumbeats “never truly finished,” a micro-repeat, but inside closure beat so allowed; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, high-density: “lunar dust settled around his boots” does triple duty (setting, tactile, elapsed time). One scaffold loop: “the climb… taken longer than planned” is restated three sentences later; minor. Mixed-metaphor risk at “dawning hush” / “dawnlit melancholy” but cadence justifies lyric repetition. No artifacts in closure beat; final line lands sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and un-showy; sentence openings vary across tactile verbs, prepositional anchors, and participial micro-breaths that mimic finger sweeps. Information density is high—every clause layers metal temperature, circuit status, and emotional valence without stacking metaphors. One minor loop artifact: “the depot’s mist… the mist outside… the mist now” appears thrice in 60 words; though functional as refrain, it edges toward template cadence and slightly dulls the closure shimmer. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero mixed metaphor; technical diction (synthetic thread, sensor alignment) stays accurate and POV-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and controlled (“frozen lake mirrored his thoughts”)—no metaphor avalanches or mixed vehicles. No scaffold, loops, or synonym churn; pronouns and spatial references stay unambiguous. Opening and final lines carry sonic echo (“patterns forming” / “patterns traced”) without feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary, paragraphs pulse. Information density high: one line often layers sensory, causal, and metaphoric work. Figurative language is coherent—sound as thread, light as memory—no mixed metaphors. Minor template cadence in “He…then he…” but it serves ritual momentum, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    High information density—each sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is patterned (“gathered hush”) and pays off. One mixed metaphor (“silence… like a weight pressing against consciousness”) is forgivable. Proofing is clean; only minor scaffold repetition in “the gathered hush once more” dulls the ear.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is propulsive yet compressed: “threading this labyrinth with his own story for once” performs triple duty—metaphor, stakes, cadence. Metaphors (wall “yielded without resistance…as if Elias himself were becoming nothing more than story and air”) remain internally consistent and physically intuitive. No loops, no scaffold; minor overwriting in “copperlight repose” repetition is pattern-taught and pays off in final image. Sentence rhythm accelerates across the permeation beat, aligning with bodily dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses (opening) to staccato gasps (“He gasped, stumbling back”) under escalating pressure. Metaphors stay internally coherent—bead as anchor, love as poison, orchard as resonant chamber—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Final line anchors echo without syntactic scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Compression high: “tide pools—usually teeming… lay cracked” packs state change in one swing. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for labyrinth descent, staccato clauses for stitching. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors internally coherent (organ-glow canyon, kelp-orchid). Single soft spot: “impossible” used thrice in closing paragraph; minor repetition, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; few filter verbs, no scaffold loops. One stretched metaphor—“roots snaking like veins”—but physical logic intact. No artifacts near closure; final sentence breathes cleanly. Minor over-modification (“impossible perfume,” “fragile thing”) holds below 9.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; figurative density peaks early, then breathes. Occasional template cadence (“Elliot was… Elliot had…”) creates faint drumbeat, not severe. No mixed metaphors or loops; information density is high. Final line lands cleanly, recharging chalk and light motifs without overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and plot work. One paraphrase loop (“echoed silence” hit three times) and a mixed metaphor (“galaxy-chart alive, pulsing…edges fraying”) dilute clarity; neither touches the closure beat. Otherwise propulsive, rhythm varied, no scaffold clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied, sentences perform double duty (e.g., “The shard began to pulse faintly, its stony exterior warming…”), no scaffold or synonym loops; one mixed metaphor—“skeletal fingers” beside “windowpane”—is minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Varied cadence, no template runs; sentences breathe during anesthetic lull then tighten at decryption. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, not purple—vehicles stay coherent (mist ≠ shroud later). Information multiplexing: coral = talisman, graft, pulse-tracker. Minor micro-movement (“shifted, her cast brushing…”) is purposeful tactile cue, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentence variation carries the swell and retreat of the vision. One paraphrase loop (“pensive mirth” twice) and a single mixed metaphor (“breath hanging like tiny ghosts”) nick half a point, but artifacts avoid the closure beat, permitting 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear varies cadence; no template stems. Mixed metaphors avoided: “tide” and “ghosts” both belong to restoration lexicon. One scaffold fragment—“the hobo_nickel cool in her hand” (underscore artifact)—is minor, outside closure beat, so −0.2 only. Density high: “grinning rogue seemed to wink” packs object, verb, personification in five words.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, read-aloud clean; sentences open varied. Occasional flourish (“leaves like cracked green shields”) but never muddles causality. One scaffold spot: “chaos of nature obscuring the rebellion beneath” could trim. Final image crystallizes without overwriting. No loops, register drift, or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“ink swirling like nebulae”) so penalty waived; no mixed vehicles. Paraphrase loops appear (“pain bloomed into constellations” vs “photosynthesize pain into beauty”)—same concept twice, −0.2. Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; opening and closing lines are sharp. Overwriting stays on lyric side of line, never opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-stack; every sentence advances image or choice. High density: “glass ink well glinted, its contents shimmering like liquid starlight” fuses object, light, and metaphor in one breath. Rhythm varies: staccato promise clauses give way to sweeping crescendo paragraph without drum-beat monotony. Internal metaphors stay coherent—starlight → music → symphony → shattered constellation—no mixed vehicles. Final line lands on concrete noun “music,” avoiding abstract closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “He unrolled the chain, its brass links catching the dappled resolve of sunlight” advances action, imagery, and theme in one sweep. Rhythm modulates from long geothermal exhalations to staccato analyzer flickers. One metaphor cluster near climax—“encrypted compassion,” “blade” of thirst—skirts but does not cross into purple; all vehicles stay mechanical or geological, coherent with POV.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “the ghost of pipe tobacco” (smell), “grain of rice” (size), “spark of night flying into day” (sight) triangulate in one sentence. No loops or filter-verb stacks; metaphor obeys physics—dust motes “wither” exactly as stars do. One register drift: “infinitesimal” feels academic for the POV, but it appears in low-pressure exposition, not the climax. Final line cadence slows to match attic hush, recharging prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm alternates between propulsive anaphora and shorter crystalline clauses, supporting the ambient hush. Figurative density is high but patterned, so Overwriting Cap is waived. A few paraphrase loops (“thresholds felt sacred… necessary distances… sacred thresholds”) dock −0.2. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks; closure image remains luminous and unpolluted by scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: stacked metaphors ("ocean’s ceiling," "shadowseam wonder") risk purple yet stay anchored to concrete optics. Occasional paraphrase loop ("luminous respite" echoed three times) slows momentum without breaking clarity. Sentence rhythm breathes with the night-long pacing; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No grammar slips or pronoun drift; opening and closing images are cleanly lodged.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned (color-emotion equations) and pays off in the empty circles. No synonym churn or template cadence. Sentence variety supports the breath-and-burst rhythm of seed-fall. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-illuminate the motif. Minor scaffold: “cheerful gloom” is repeated without new inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic; no synonym loops or scaffold sentences. Mixed metaphors are intentional and coherent—“sky bruised with constellations,” “bishop’s shadow stretched like a phantom limb”—each returns to reinforce closure. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, interior motive, and foreshadowing. Final line lands with percussive brevity that mirrors Elias’s laugh and propels exit momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“moonstone dust speck...pulsing with residual magic that defied suppression”). No synonym loops; metaphors coherent (veins of light ≠ contradictory vehicles). One template cadence run (“from...from...from”) but purposeful parallelism teaching tidal sources. Final line propels outward, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    High figurative density in every sentence—sometimes three metaphors per line (“prism atrium,” “overgrown thoughts,” “nocturnal-daylight dialogues”). Pattern is consistent and voice-motivated, but peak beats (rings 4-7) risk purple haze that blurs causal clarity. No paraphrase loops, no template cadence, information dense. Mixed metaphors (“spine” + “atrium” + “rainbow droplets”) coexist without outright contradiction. Closure image stays sharp; earlier glitter could be pruned 15% for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template runs. Figurative language is selective, not stacked: “ink spilled across parchment” appears once and pays off in closure’s redrafted “internal mapping.” No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Minor scaffold: “the way he had held…how he had written…” could trim, but artifacts never touch the final beat. Information density remains high—each sentence advances memory, object handling, or setting charge.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm excellent; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe with tide cadence. No scaffold or synonym loops; information density high—each shell placement also characterizes. One mixed metaphor (“mantle” of purpose) but resolved within line. Closing image—“heart light as a balloon, tethered to earth”—earned by prior tether imagery; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (ivy=setting+symbol, negative=clue+threat). No synonym loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphor check: “coiled like a snake” beside “cold as the grave” is acceptable because both serve temperature+danger. Final-line paradox (“not weight—direction”) lands clean. Minor overwriting in “stubborn secrets” phrase (−0.1) but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear test strong: cadence accelerates from languid participle openers to staccato bell clauses, miraging then shattering. No mixed metaphors; “mirage dissolved gracefully into the morning light” is coherent. High information density—one sentence often delivers setting cue + sensory data + heartbeat update. Minor template cadence in opening descriptor stack but pattern is taught and serves lyric hypnosis. Proofing clean; pronoun “she” stays anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “ebony clipboard, its polished surface absorbing the midsummer sun” performs scene-setting, object characterization, and metaphor in one stroke. Figurative language is spare and pattern-driven—“slow dance of celestial bodies” recurs three times, each re-pricing the last—so density penalty is waived. Zero paraphrase loops; no sentence opens with identical template. Final line varies cadence: “a quiet understanding that redemption was not a destination but a journey” delivers closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful variation; only minor scaffold (“the very man who had caused it”) restates prior clause. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—salt as mirror, drought as silence—teaching the reader early. No mixed metaphors in the closure beat; the rain-applause image is precise and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but stacked metaphors (“threads of light,” “trapped fireflies,” “web of possibilities”) crowd several sentences and slightly dull the tactile immediacy the moment demands. No loops or paraphrase stacks; information density is high. A single mixed vehicle—threads that both pulse and burn—mutes precision in the climax clause.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“darkness descended like a velvet curtain”) and does not clog high-pressure beats. Strong verbs carry motion, and paragraph cuts tighten the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; metaphor threads (blushing stillness, stuttering flame) cohere without muddle. Minor scaffold: three successive “He…” openings mid-build create a faint template pulse, not severe enough to blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence layers new sensorial or causal data. Metaphors stay coherent—rope as serpent, aurora as choir—without mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and interior shift (“Light bloomed… projecting the card’s pattern onto the ice walls”). Rhythm modulates from long auroral sweeps to staccato name-murmurs, propelling the final cadence. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “He arranged his tools with practiced economy: a reed stylus, wax tablets, and a polished bronze mirror to catch the starlight” simultaneously reveals character, setting, and impending method. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors; “dusky harmony” is the only metaphor and it reprises at closure, paying off its pattern. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and acoustically matched. Micro-scaffold spotted once: “its surface cool against his fingertips” → “its surface dulled again” repeats “its surface” but the reprise is intentional callback, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor synonym churn: “shifting grace,” “grace shifting form,” “melody of shifting grace”—three instances within 80 words. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene—short sentences under client encounters, longer reflective lines at starlight. Figurative language stays coherent (waves, starlight). High information density: one sentence often conflates setting cue + emotional read + object state.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “shards of mirror glass he had collected from abandoned houses, each piece holding fragments of reflected fog” does three jobs—backstory, setting, metaphor—in one breath. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors (pale ghosts, prismatic wings) stay coherent within light-and-glass physics. Rhythm modulates from frost-bitten crispness to dome-sealing hush without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long anaphora of “She…” mirrors liturgical cadence, paid off in final spare “Grow.” Figurative density peaks at orchard personification but never muddles causality. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds soil, object, or symbolic nudge. Filter verbs minimal; props tracked cleanly across ascent→burial→descent.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density is high; most sentences double-duty (e.g.,“Each piece of fruit contained a stolen moment…” advances setting and stakes). Minor loop: “simply complicated” recurs eight times, a touch over-leveraged, but the phrase is motif-coded so penalty stays light (−0.3). No mixed metaphors or scaffold, but the repeated adjective-noun pairing borders on template cadence, preventing 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence either advances the search or re-weights the store’s grammar. Figurative language is selective (“cascade of silent, shimmering notes” is fresh and precise). One minor paraphrase loop: “a scent that felt like an unheard symphony magnified to a deafening volume” layers two metaphors for the same stimulus; the slip is local and does not touch the closure beat. No scaffold, no filter-verb clusters, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breathless sentences for fog, staccato fragments for card pulses. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful; occasional synonym swirl (“trapped freedom,” “fractured identity”) borders mantra yet supports dream-logic. No mixed metaphors or loops obstruct closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes during discovery, then shortens for final twists. Figurative language is selective—threads of starlight, candle-flame titles—avoiding purple drift. One paraphrase loop: “fables of absence whispered” is restated in same beat. High information density: brass oil / parchment / seal / rope pattern all serve double duty as sensory and plot gear. No scaffolding or filter-verb stacks obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphor chains (“storm of light,” “screaming light”) occasionally layer without fresh payoff, creating minor purple density. No loops or scaffold; clauses stay crisp, and the bloom sentence achieves breath-stopping clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but information-dense; each sentence layers astronomy, tactile motion, and memory flash. Metaphors are coherent—light as audible hush—never mixed. Minor scaffold: “three years of observations” repeats; “pattern” over-used near end, but loops do not infect the closure beat. Opening and closing lines are strong image-anchors; no paraphrase loops in final third. High read-aloud rhythm with purposeful paragraph variegation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“dome split by lightning that never struck” condenses setting, threat, and paradox in one image. Rhythm accelerates toward the dawn melt, then exhales into the final short clause. Zero loops, no synonym churn; “preemptively nostalgic” is purposeful pattern, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional poetic uplift (“twilight painted…lavender and gold”) is purposeful and patterned; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; final paragraph avoids explanatory bloat, letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythmic control is high; sentences ebb and flow like the tide. Two paraphrase loops (“between…between” and “texture of time” repeated) deduct −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Information density is strong; each sentence layers image, character, and theme. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often delivers setting cue, sensory bite, and emotional register (“air smelled like rain and starlight”). No scaffold or loops; each metaphor is unique and physically coherent. Occasional elevated diction—“xenial trellis,” “gilded hush”—is earned by lyric mode taught in first paragraph. Final third avoids artifact; the fractured hush and ghost aftertaste are precise, leaving closure image sharp.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The inversion-hour silence-harvest is a fresh synthesis of familiar portal-fantasy and sensory-memory tropes, made inevitable by bunker-raised claustrophobe who treats quiet as sustenance. Risk—lyric accumulation rather than plot reversals—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Specificity: trellis above clouds pulsing with silver vines feels native to this world yet nowhere else. Transformation test fails if Elara is swapped out; only her trained ear makes the silence flavors legible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each sentence layers sense-stuff while advancing orbit or breath. Minor loop traces appear (“the vial was... still” x2) yet never stall the final image. Metaphors stay physically coherent (light as breath, terrace as lung), avoiding purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “ruby flake older than floating cities” does world, history, and stakes in one clause. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for mural reveal, then staccato “precious minutes fading.” Zero filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s looping phrase “sally not into space, but back…” is purposeful cadence, not artifact, echoing opening.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    High information density; most sentences layer job, image, and metaphor. Figurative runs cluster in reflective paragraphs but pattern is taught early and paid off in the final metallic taste of the knock. One scaffold loop: “she had learned that … she had learned that” repeats concept without new pressure. Otherwise crisp verbs, zero synonym churn, no filter stacks; metaphor logic stays consistent (iron as flesh, emptiness as orchid).

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong sensory nouns and verbs, high information density; one paraphrase loop (“the weight of it, not just physically, but existently”) and a mixed metaphor (“forest of glowing caps that pulsed”) dull the knife-edge needed for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong cross-modal density—brass cool, sepia sigh—without purple overload. No loops or scaffold. Opening participle “casting” creates simultaneity hiccup, but causality holds. Closure image is clean, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies; long lyrical coils alternate with short declarative strokes, supporting breathless ascent. Metaphors stay within dream-logic (“liquid thoughts,” “time stretching like taffy”) and do not clash. Minor scaffold: “the knight…”, “the knight…” paragraph openers repeat four times, creating template cadence (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or mixed vehicles. High information density: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal freight. Proofing clean; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Syntactic variety carries information double-duty; “accumulated dust patterns wrote their own stories” marries tactile detail to metaphor without overwriting; near-zero filter verbs, no scaffold loops, climax line unmarred by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, high-density, and mostly free of loops; only minor scaffold (“as evening fell… as dusk settled”) repetition. Mixed metaphors avoided; “slow poison of altered records” is vivid and coherent. One simultaneity slip (“watching as the old technology hummed to life” during insertion) is forgivable. No artifact obscures the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet musical: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; “rainbows in the fading mist” carries dual literal/optical sense inside one image.
    Opening and closing sentences mirror each other (“dewdrops formed” / “dewdrops form”) to create a circular cadence that tightens the ritual frame.
    Minor scaffold appears in repetitive “the… the…” anaphora in paragraph 4; not dense enough to dull momentum but keeps this just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (action + world-rule). Figurative language is selective—“wings like dragonfly membranes” is the single simile in the climax, earning its keep. No scaffold loops; however, the refrain “something emerges transformed always” becomes a template cadence that mildly dulls momentum. Register remains coherent; no mixed metaphors or physics violations. Final line (“monument to all that would never be forgotten again) offers a crisp, inverted echo of the opening ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm alternates between short metallic clauses and longer liquid sentences, mirroring workshop drip vs. waterfall roar. High information density: one sentence often does description, interiority, and foreshadowing. Zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. “Skeletons of clocks,” “compass refused to choose a single truth” are fresh yet precise. Closure beat “sound like the universe exhaling” lands clean, no overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies, imagery dense but purposeful; however, three near-identical “rain-washed” stems and two “balance/balanced” loops create micro-redundancy. Metaphors stay coherent, no mixed vehicles. High-pressure forge beat is compressed, not overwritten. Minor scaffolding (“the foundry’s…” repeated possessive) slightly dulls propulsion. No artifacts touch the closure line.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong rhythmic variance; short percussive clauses accelerate during confessions, then lengthen into lullaby cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned—the harp metaphor is taught early and repaid at end. Minor template echo (“each step…each note…each confession”) but it functions as ritual incantation rather than scaffold. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences couple sensory data to philosophical weight (“the canopy above pulsed with a sickly violet glow that made the shadows writhe”). Metaphors are coherent—mask as ghost, forest as integral limit—no mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective pairs (“rough and unforgiving”) are earned by pressure. No loops or scaffold; final line is clean, propulsive, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    High sentence-level density; metaphors (glass as bridge) recur without overstuffing. One paraphrase loop—“between worlds… between childhood and now” earns slack for thematic echo. No filter-verb stacks; clauses propel. Final line cadence perfectly resolves lyric pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image, pressure, or tool-use. Metaphors stay physically coherent (fractured plaster “whispering,” dust “shroud”). High information density: one line can layer sensory detail, back-history, and method. Rhythm breathes—long clauses for vision, staccato for ladder work—without monotony. Closure line is spare, letting the pocketed weight do final work.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective, never obscuring causality (“bottled whisper…pressing against the glass”). Information density high: each sentence advances image, motive, or stakes. One paraphrase loop—“the whispers had begun…”—costs a tenth. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and closure-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information. Metaphors stay coherent: “light...pooled, wept” extends water imagery without contradiction. Minor scaffold: “the light within the room began to congeal, to paint images” could be one verb. No loops or register drift; final image is crystal-clear. Rhythm accelerates into the vision, then breathes out with quiet smuggling exit.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    High sensory density without scaffold; metaphors stay consistent (music / light / rust). Minor template cadence in “his fingers… with a dancer’s grace” and later “moved like minuet dancers” reuses syntactic stem; a few adjectival stacks (“filaments of starlight he had collected…”) could trim. Closure line breathes cleanly, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances scent, sound, or subterranean revelation. Only one soft scaffold paraphrase (“a place of perfect, suspended stillness” following the lagoon description) nicks -0.2; no loops or mixed metaphors obscure causality. Metaphors stay geologic and wet, coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density. Occasional modifier stacks (“turbine-hum reverie overtaking the storm’s fury”) flirt with overwriting but stay within lyric contract. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb clusters. One mixed metaphor—“timewoven alliances made manifest”—slips in mid-climax, dulling edge.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer time, scent, and paint texture without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent: moonlight as cloak, snow as melt-water tick. Only minor scaffold—“she had learned” summary in final paragraph could be dramatized, but it is brief and lands after closure image. Clean grammar; pronoun reference clear despite long sentences. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information density high: single sentences fuse action, metaphor, archive procedure (“ciphered text turning bones to water”). Varied rhythm mirrors pressure—participle openings cluster during retrocognitive surge, then stark subject-verb for final “REMEMBER.” Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. “Ink bleeding like penance” stays within physical logic. Final line cadence satisfies ear.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror town-assembly beats. Metaphors mostly coherent; one mixed strain—“infrastructure of possibility” is abstract. No synonym loops or scaffold. Information density high: one sentence often delivers sensory detail + world rule + emotional correlative. Closure line is clean, but preceding sentence packs three abstractions that thin the image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful; figurative chains (“languages that had ceased breathing,” “ghosts given temporary voice”) serve concept, not ornament. No mixed metaphors, no loops, no template cadence. Rhythm accelerates into compression at immersion—“pressed the wax shaving against his temple, closed his eyes”—matching tempo of neural overwrite. Clean copy; minor pronoun clarity slips (“its” referring to foghorn then city) do not impede causality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each ice crystal a "tiny verse"—and pays off in closure image. One paraphrase loop: "wild serenity" echoed as "wild serenity" without new charge. Otherwise high density, clean grammar, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “wind shifted direction slightly, and Elian noticed it immediately” performs triple duty—weather, senses, stakes. Only minor loop: “the sanctuary itself seemed to float...” followed by “an impossible structure built by those who had climbed...” slightly paraphrases the floating idea. Mixed metaphors avoided; “sea of white” and “sleeping python” coexist without clash. Final sentence carries momentum downhill without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, largely loop-free; occasional “she began to” scaffolding repeats but never obscures causality. Metaphors consistent—light, breath, warmth—no mixed vehicles. High information density: each sentence layers image or emotional increment. One paraphrase loop mid-final paragraph (−0.2) prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “He placed it gently atop the weathered wood, his gaze fixed on the bees as they swarmed around the glass, somehow understanding their role in this ritual” (action + setting + symbolism). No paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the mute eloquence motif without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is largely clean, but repeated noun-phrase openers (“The…”) and templated “his fingers tracing / his breath catching” sap rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “a puzzle with missing pieces, its mysteries just beginning to unfold” restates the prior sentence. No mixed metaphors, and closure line avoids clutter, keeping artifact damage minor.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
    <comment>Combining garage-sale cryptography with a post-numeric time collapse is a fresh hybrid; the concept’s oddity feels specific, not gimmicky. However, the capsule’s creators remain offstage, so the societal transformation reads as convenient backdrop rather than lived consequence. Still, the synthesis of mundane thrift-shop code and ontological rupture shows inventive risk within flash length.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, efficient; sentences vary in length and opening. Metaphors are coherent (wire as memory conduit) and sparse enough for accretive texture. No synonym loops or paraphrase stalls. Only minor scaffold: “each copper-wrapped branch creating a network” restates prior beat. Closing paragraph maintains propulsion; final line carries double duty—image and reconfiguration—without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent: longer sensory clauses tighten into single-line beats at pedestal. Metaphors stay geologic and chemical—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers weather, body, and concept (“rain had smoothed the stones, but the footprints remained”). Zero paraphrase loops; “bronze quiet” recurs with reweighted meaning, not repetition for filler. Clean grammar; opening and closing images echo without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new information (seed→crevice→tide→root). Metaphors stay coherent: “hollow expanse that mirrored the hollow…heart” sustains mirror-logic without mixed vehicle. High density: “ferrying not just passengers but promises between realms” collapses job, cosmology, and emotional cargo into one line. Only two near-adjacent “hollow” repetitions, but they serve echo, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong density: “gilded compass rose applique he’d salvaged from the bridge” does triple duty—object history, tactile focus, thematic seed—in one phrase. Metaphors stay physical and consistent (taffy, velvet, smoke). One paraphrase loop—“silence… echoing silence” in adjacent clauses—dings −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with action. Closure image is clean, no purple flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breaths with the climb-then-trade tempo; no template cadence. Information density high—each sentence advances stake or texture. Metaphors are spare and consistent: glassy air, blizzard bells, canvas sky—no mixed vehicles. Final line “painted his first stroke” is a concise, propulsive image that recharges the earlier sky-reset without overwriting it. Minor scaffold: “the sky was right again” repeats the earlier wrong-sky motif, but the echo is purposeful, not looped.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong information density: a single sentence often layers metaphor, motion, and thematic reprise (“chessboard without pawns became a metaphor…”). Metaphors are internally coherent (echoes = seeds, absence = invitation) and avoid muddled logic. Rhythm varies: cumulative clauses imitate circling, then tighten into punch-clauses. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; no filters clogging immediacy. Occasional elevated phrasing is earned by lyric mode; closure beat remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, tactic, and memory. Figurative layering is controlled—no mixed metaphors—but “woven hush” is repeated enough to flirt with template cadence. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. One scaffold phrase—“his fingers, trembling slightly”—could compress, but it doesn’t stall propulsion. Closure image is clean and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Varied sentence cadence mirrors echo-surges; no template churn. Metaphors stay physical and tested—spire as “containment device,” not abstract symbol. Minor scaffold: “each day as the ritual approached” repeats thrice but serves accumulative drumbeat. Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with submersion cycles; sentences vary openings, no template cadence. Figurative density peaks in the final third but pattern-earned (“golden lines flowing like mercury”). One paraphrase loop mid-piece (“between breaths held underwater” restated) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm: paratactic glide down alley, then caesura on “hidden oasis.” Metaphors stay physically grounded—“tiny metronomes,” “ink into parchment.” Zero template cadence; no filter-verb clusters. Information density high: one sentence slips setting, age, and lifetime ritual. Only micro-slip: “temporary eternity” phrase appears twice; second occurrence borders thematic echo, but final image justifies reprising the paradox. No artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, and causal push—without overcrowding. Figurative language is selective: “sky bruised from purple to rose” condenses time and mood in one verb. No synonym loops or scaffold; each noun is specific (cereus, moonflower, salt-summoned wind). Rhythm breathes with ascent: spiral stair sentences tighten, balcony sentences open.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but controlled: “each patch a memory of places he’d once known” does triple duty—world, character, thematic spine. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“the station’s silence returned, deeper now”) costs −0.2. Figurative logic stays coherent—bronze that “shimmers like liquid moonlight” keeps within the maritime/celestial palette. No artifact touches the closure image, so 9+ remains technically possible, but the loop keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “roots reached into soil-filled containers that swayed precariously” packages setting, danger, and object in one stroke. No filler loops; each sentence advances basket, storm, or mind. Metaphors stay physical—“glass eye gleamed with an inner light that seemed to capture the storm’s fury”—anchoring abstraction in sensory data. Final line lands with imagistic punch: “a few precious moments of being alone inside one’s own head” is concise, unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical but stays readable; some metaphor density in opener (“nautical twilight painted the mist…”) could trim. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance image or knowledge. Occasional stacked modifiers (“perfectly preserved dried Edelweiss boutonnière”) but meaning intact. Final paragraph risks paraphrase-loop on “shared isolation” theme, yet cadence serves closure uplift. Generally controlled, with ear-pleasing variation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence slips map lore, weather, and emotional stasis. Metaphors are lean and consistent (time as water, chip as compass). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated register (“bioluminescent fungi”) is justified by Elias’s scholarly tilt. Final line cadence mirrors creek hush—sentence lengthens, then clip—reinforcing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract on the climb, lengthen in grotto reveal. Mixed metaphors avoided; “starlight bled…to rust” is precise. Minor scaffold: “shared exhale spotting” could lose “of summer” without loss; no loops or register drift in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses build incantation, then snap to short final sentence “Their light did not fade.” Information density high—single sentences perform setting, metaphor, and emotional turn. One mixed-metaphor twitch: “palette of resolve” (paint) vs. “spectrum of immutable decisions” (light) within three lines, but does not obscure causality. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; every recurrence reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies from cascading anaphora to clipped fragments; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective: “creaked like old bones,” “wind howled like wolves,” each serving ambience without clutter. One mixed metaphor—“bruised purples and fiery oranges” stacked with “gnawed at his insides”—is minor. Information density high: single sentences deliver setting, bodily state, and temporal rupture; no paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances image or emotional state. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (mist like sigh, screw as map). Opening and closing lines bracket the arc with sonic echo. A single passive clause (“the water clock…was here”) is strategically placed to slow the beat before revelation; otherwise verbs are strong. No artifact intrudes on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is compressed yet lyrical; each sentence carries image + motion + stakes. Metaphors (“inkstone smooth as a placid lake”) are few, deliberate, never layered into purple. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn. Clause rhythm modulates from long inhalations to clipped releases as storm approaches, accelerating heartbeat without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density, no loops. Figurative control: “mournful blue light” is singular, not stacked; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during current pulse, then exhales into the quiet final paragraph. One minor scaffold: “the bottle was once again just an old object” could trim “once again,” but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    Individual sentences are often exquisite, but figurative density is near 100 %—every line stacks metaphor upon metaphor—creating a purple haze that slows propulsion (−0.5). Mixed-metaphor risk is high yet usually avoided; when it slips (“universe’s hiccup…shattered mirror with no reflection”) the physics collapses momentarily. Paraphrase loops recur (“to unravel…to unify…to weave”) handing the reader the same cosmic tautology in new garb (−0.3). Nonetheless, cadence breathes with emotional rises and the final blank page lands clean, sparing the closure beat from artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; paragraph cuts carry emotional charge. No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors precise: “razor edges of time” sustained without contradiction. High information density: one sentence fuses tool, body, concept (“mantle clock key…felt not like a tool…”). Opening and closing lines anchor and re-weight motif.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is restrained—one mixed metaphor (“wildfire burning in his chest”) but it does not obscure causality. High information density: sensory detail folded into action beats. Scaffolding is minimal; only slight paraphrase loop (“permeable barriers… letting go” restated) costs −0.2, leaving clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally clean, high density, with only minor loop risks (“rainwashed…rain…rain” in closing paragraph). One paraphrase pair: “a gambler’s maxim, a lucid contradiction” followed by “Another lucid contradiction” within six lines—minor echo. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final third artifact-free, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, stakes, and sensory hit (“Each night…between the hum of streetlamps…the disc would begin to resonate”). No paraphrase loops; each mention of the disc adds new sonic fallout. Occasional elevated diction—“melodically haunted,” “conceptual cost”—slightly drifts from tunnel vernacular but stays within Archie’s self-taught lexicon of sound. Closure beat is clean: final sentence crystallizes the question without metaphor clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tide; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and earned: “gentle fist” crystallizes closure without mixed metaphor. Information density high—“luminous flowers that had sprung from the weathered wooden planks” does world, sensory, and metaphor work in one stroke. Zero scaffolding or paraphrase loops; opening and final lines anchor and release cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors climb: short declaratives during ladder ascent, longer flowing lines inside dome. No loops or scaffold; each line advances knowledge or atmosphere—"smelled of damp earth and rust" doubles as sensory and metaphor. Figurative language sparse, precise: "vacuum in his chest" sustains celestial motif. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs—"he scanned," "he forfeited"—propel.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often does two jobs—“the ground itself spoke to him in tremors” reveals world rule + character method. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent: “yielding like a lover’s sigh” keeps tactile consistency. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Minor register elevation (“liquid sunlight”) is brief and motivated by epiphanic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences multitask: *“The anomaly’s pull was a language, and they had learned to speak it through the pen’s exotic nib”* simultaneously advances character, tool, and metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; each reprise of “confidently uncertain” adds pressure. Metaphors stay physically coherent—gravity as language, seeds as doubt. One micro-tighten: *“its history of dried-up ink a testament to patience”* could compress, but the cadence serves the hush before sleep; flaw is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence variety avoids template cadence. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent under the accretive lens—mixed metaphors are scarce. One paraphrase loop (“each wave a beat, each glimmer a chord”) repeats conceptually but serves pattern, not padding. No scaffold or filter-verb clusters; information density stays high.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high information density per line. Figurative layer is thick (volcanic, storm-cloud eyes) yet internally coherent; no mixed metaphors at climax. Minor loop: “paint and perseverance”/“paint and purpose” echo. Closing image is crisp, unscaffolded. One typo: “acntmporary” for “a contemporary” costs a hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences breathe with corridor length, then shorten at key-click; no template cadence. Concrete nouns predominate—“corrugated sides,” “disguised seam.” One mixed metaphor—“city of steel giants” beside “labyrinth listens”—but it’s taught early and functional. No loops, scaffold, or filter stacks; information density high. Final line propels without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyric density is high but patterned: mirror-glint, water-glint, star-glint form a taught triad that pays off. Occasional elevated diction (“spiralingly calm,” “luminous truth”) nudges toward purple yet remains consistent with the guardian’s meditation-in-motion. No loops, no template cadence; paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm is deliberate: paragraph lengths stair-step to the midnight switch, sentence pulses accelerate with motion-sensor lights. Information density is high—each sentence handles atmosphere, motive, and tactic (“He could hear unspoken words rippling…confusion giving way to curiosity”). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. A single mixed image—“starlight filtered…like scattered silver coins”—is the only figurative muddle, and it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm mimics wave-pulse; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor stack (“grace a stark contrast to brutish labor… violence become impossible”) is vivid enough to pass. High information density: each line layers sensory, emotional, or symbolic work. Proofing clean; only micro-glitch is repeated “the scrimshaw glow/glowed” within 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is spare but musical; sentence length varies to let carving beats breathe. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Information density high—“shavings collecting like snow on the tabletop” does triple duty: tactile, visual, and foreshadowing of frozen grief. Minor overuse of “dramatically announce” formula during inspections, but the pattern is voice-motivated and never muddles closure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density with zero loops: each sentence layers metaphor atop sensory action without paraphrase. Rhythm modulates from controlled, observational cadence to compressed dissolution beats, matching pulse of colonnade. Metaphors stay physically coherent (obsidian lake, cosmic cello) and do not collide. No scaffolding, template cadence, or register drift; final clause “fleeting masterpiece” is earned imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “kaleidoscope of hues he could only perceive as shades of gray” performs double duty—world-building + character limitation. No register drift; “ceramic,” “cerulean,” “sienna” belong to painter lexicon. Final line’s anaphoric triple—“glorious, messy, vibrant”—is earned cadence, not template, releasing the built pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is musical: long resonance-building clauses alternate with single-note fragments, miricking the struck fork’s decay. No paraphrase loops; each refractive image advances the stake rather than re-illustrates it. Metaphor density is high but patterned—light, sound, silence—so coherence survives. One hairline slip: “the light and sound merged, inseparable and whole” borders on abstract summary, yet it lands in the closure beat where conceptual merge is exactly the earned effect, so penalty waived.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is mostly tight, but three adjacent sentences open with “The…/His…/Two years…” creating template cadence that dulls momentum. Figurative language is selective—phoenix vines, storm clouds of grief—and stays within jeweler’s metaphor palette, so coherence holds. One paraphrase loop: “network of possibility, spanning time itself” restates the prior sentence’s expansion without new pressure. Closure image avoids overwritten flourish, ending on lantern-lit constellations, a visual beat that breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies; long reflective clauses contract into short, tactile bursts—“She drew a new card… The Hermit reversed.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and precise—“drops a tiny prism”—and never stack into overwriting. Opening and closing lines echo tape and starlight, creating a quiet, lyric frame that propels rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Some sentences stack metaphor—“atoms of nostalgia,” “essence of what had been”—in high-pressure beat, risking purple, but density stays below the −0.7 threshold. One paraphrase loop: “she had come to purify…purification required avoiding patterns” adjacent; −0.2. Grammar clean; no simultaneity errors. Overall propulsion high enough to keep 8-band within reach but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—“shadows stretched like fingers” stays physical. Information density is high: one sentence often does two jobs (worldbuild + emotion). Minor scaffold: “luminous regret” is repeated twice; could vary diction but does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “emerald to gold to dusk” does triple sensory+symbolic work in four words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new layer of evidence or emotional charge. Metaphors (shedding infected tissue) are extended consistently and paid off. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for backstory, staccato for present beats. Copy clean; pronouns unambiguous. One minor scaffold: “the quiet vividness of its hues” is abstract, but instantly embodied by color list; does not blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is rhythm-varied, image-dense, mostly propulsive; a few stacked metaphors (“concentric coffee rings…map to someone’s pain” followed by “moths to flame”) create transient purple tint. No template cadence or synonym loops; filter verbs minimal. Line-level clarity intact, but figurative layering in peak beats keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor extends the film-reel conceit rather than decorating it. Rhythm modulates with discovery, climaxing in the single-sentence paragraph that lands the “when” revelation, a drum hit that justifies the prior crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density high—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and mythic resonance. One paraphrase loop minor: “the stardust remembered, too, swirling…” restates prior image (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; “golden tear” and “frozen dawn” stay coherent. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“flared,” “swallow,” “collapsed”) propel. No scaffold or template cadence detected. Clean copy, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    Few loops; high density—each sentence layers image, rule, or stake; metaphors stay coherent (clock/leaf veins mirror frozen time); occasional template cadence (“the freight guard…”) is intentional refrain, not scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs, peak beats uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong sentence variety and purposeful density; only minor scaffold—“the same question” / “the same dawn” echo without new twist. One mixed metaphor: “consciousness has wandering feet” beside mechanical diffusion, but it pays off metaphorically. Pronoun “they” stays stable; no loops in final third. Clean enough for elite consideration, not yet crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but patterned: repeated “indirect routes,” “star-stamped,” and “shoreline lullaby” risk template cadence, though the recurrence serves accumulative design. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay maritime and astral. Occasional scaffolding (“the path is never straight,” “courage isn’t the absence of fear”) states what images already show, trimming density. No artifact obscures causality or dulls the final pool image, keeping the line-level above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances setting, character, or stake without scaffold. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“dust-covered steps swirling like clouds”—never crowding the mechanical clarity. No loops or paraphrase; sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with ascent/descent. Only a trace of template cadence in the three “the bellhop…” anaphora lines, but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final stasis, so it reads as intentional litany rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathe-able; every sentence advances image or pressure. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors—vehicles stay physical (nebula, silk, ash). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; openings avoid template cadence. Single near-purple phrase—“constellation uncoiled and a new star blazed in the dragon’s eye”—is earned by established celestial frame and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“atlas edges curled like salt-fried parchment” is specific, not decorative. Opening and closing lines echo station heartbeat, creating frame-rhythm. Micro-slip: “numbers flickering…meaningless” borders abstract tell, but immediately grounded in finger-tap response. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, mostly propulsive; figurative layering is purposeful—cosmic imagery mirrors internal scope. Occasional modifier stacks (“grimy skylights, illuminating dust motes that drifted like distant galaxies”) flirt with overwriting but serve accumulative texture. No mixed metaphors or loops; sentence variety healthy. Final line avoids cadence template, landing clean. Could trim two adjectives to hit 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense: one sentence often delivers setting cue + emotional tilt + plot pivot. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; volcanic and vegetal imagery stays coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“earth’s heated womb”) flirts with register drift but remains anchored in mythic tone she would use.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay vegetal and coherent—root systems, salt, succulents—without mixed-vehicle clutter. High information density: one sentence often layers gardening action, memory cue, and thematic echo. Minor scaffold: “quietly talented hands” appears twice; accepted as deliberate motif. Closure line is crisp image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Information density high; most sentences dual-task (e.g., “its broken edges sticky with salt and time”). Mixed-metaphor risk in “bones of a forgotten thing” but physical logic holds. Two scaffold spots: “he asked himself” twice in adjacent rhetorical clusters; minor loop. No artifacts in closure beat; read-aloud rhythm varied. One paraphrase loop costs −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rhythmic and compressed; sentences carry dual duty—description advances concept. One paraphrase loop (“the ink didn’t dry; instead, it dissolved”) is forgivable. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is generally varied, but repetitive anaphora (“The snow… The council… The echoing library…”) in the final third creates a detectable template cadence that dulls momentum. Mixed metaphors are absent; density is high. Minor scaffold: “contraband truths” is repeated four times in 70 words, a synonym churn that pads rather than deepens. Closure image itself is clean and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences vary in length, avoid template cadence. Occasional softeners—“shimmered in the relentless sun”—could be cut, but they don’t stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Final paragraph’s long sentence mirrors rose growth, earning its breath.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence performs two roles (image + causal push). No loops, no synonym churn. Mixed metaphor risk in “ghost in the machine of the cosmos” passes because it is brief and character-internal. Sentence rhythm breathes with action—long hums clipped by glyph cuts. Clean grammar; pronoun paths unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “grief didn’t bend a pen nib; force did” compresses causality + emotional pivot in nine words. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent. Occasional elevated diction—“conceptual repricing,” “teleological vector”—justified by observatory-heiress intellect. Final cadence slows into solemn promise without sagging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is textured yet clean: “flickering like ghosts against the stone walls” does double duty (visual + theme) without crowding. One scaffold loop—“the emergent hush that seemed to absorb even the whispers”—is restated in adjacent sentences, a minor paraphrase worth −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift; rhythm modulates from long breathy lines to the staccato “With a breath that tasted of lilac and courage,” supporting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “She carried a minaret mosaic tessera in her palm, its colors scorched but not erased” compresses history, object, and metaphor in one muscular line. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent (lion→watcher, ashes→garden). One mixed moment—“warm coldness enveloped her, the embrace of a world healing”—leans abstract, but the tactile setup earlier earns it. Final line “The world listened” lands as crisp Charged Poise without syntactic flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; only minor scaffold (“decades of performance had not merely…”) and one mixed metaphor (“temporal fragments worn thin”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line crystallizes the reconfiguration. No loops obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is strong, but occasional modifier stacks (“fractally precise layers shimmering”) verge on purple in a high-pressure beat, and two adjacent sentences open with “The light…/The static…” creating template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence advances color, body, or map—yet these micro-slips keep it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety is musical; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors (cave as instrument, fossils as lanterns) stay coherent and physically grounded. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. Only microscopic hedge: “almost alive” slightly softens an otherwise crisp image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is selective—buttons like river stones, echo as chorus—and stays coherent under the accumulative design. One paraphrase loop: “the prophecy was not a fixed path but a tapestry of choices” is conceptually restated twice within four lines, a minor scaffold (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or concept. Clean grammar and tense. Overall, line-level craft supports the lyric ascent without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is scaffold-free: no template cadence, no synonym loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“mist like cold, ectoplasmic water” sets tone without overwriting). High information density—each sentence layers sensory data, back-story cue, or tactical choice. Opening and final lines perform double duty: anchor atmosphere and stake / echo erasure motif. Copy clean: tense stable, pronouns unambiguous. No artifact touches closure beat, permitting 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and image-rich, but figurative language clusters in every sentence of the climax beat (“canvas for his spindrift serenity”) creating slight purple haze. A few template cadences (“the… the…” anaphora) are deliberate and paid off. No loops or mixed metaphors, but the over-ripeness keeps it shy of 9-territory.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: “a frozen amber tear in the fabric of the now” does triple image-work without purple drift. Rhythm modulates—long smoke sentence vs. staccato “He waited.” Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor (“sharp gentleness”) is intentionally oxymoronic and thematic, not accidental clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, with only one paraphrase loop (“luminous harbor by moonlight” echoed twice). Metaphors stay coherent—boats like corks, moonbeams redirected. No filter-verb stacks. One template cadence in “working with the rhythm of oars in water” repeated, but it is motif-driven and taught early. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting image carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“atomically reflective,” “tidal library”) and pays off at closure. One mixed-metaphor risk—“crystalline shell around her heart”—but physical logic holds. Information density strong; every sentence advances memory, image, or emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often does scene work, atmosphere, and metaphor. Figurative language is patterned (spiral imagery) and paid off, avoiding purple overload. Minor scaffold: “water still dripped… still dripped” could compress. Final line earns its uplift without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, information-dense, and largely free of loops or scaffold. A few template cadences (“the patterns subtly changed whenever…”) recur, but they serve as signal-leitmotif rather than artifact. Metaphors are sparse and unobtrusive; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-based economy. A stray adjective stack (“ethereal grit”) is the only micro-purple moment; it doesn’t blur causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong sentence variety and information density, yet figurative drift clusters in peak beat (“shadows elongating into impossible angularities while starlight fractured into prismatic shards”) risk coherence; no loop or scaffold, but overwriting nudges clarity −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: each sentence layers job—advances charcoal stroke, deepens mist, re-crimsons ribbon. No scaffold loops; synonym churn absent. Metaphors stay physically coherent (ribbon as lifeline, mist as veil). One mixed image—“quarry’s breath cold on his neck”—is instantly disambiguated by tactile context. Clause variety and paragraph rhythms modulate with pressure peaks. Copy-clean; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is generally smooth; sentence openings vary. Two scaffold spots: “the station’s automated systems groaned, battling the atmospheric chaos unleashed after the jet stream shifted” could be one compressed clause; “his motivation burned brighter than the flickering emergency lights” is a stock comparative. No mixed metaphors; no loops in closure beat. Information density is solid; paragraphs could be tighter. Overall clean but not yet dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates—short staccato sentences for vanish, longer flowing clauses for music—supporting momentum. Minor scaffold: “pixelated amnesty” is repeated four times in last third without fresh inflection (−0.2). Otherwise high density; no mixed metaphors; grammar clean; no loops in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: long accumulative sentences for the train description, clipped fragments during the startup collapse. Metaphors (“paper tapestry of journeys”) cohere without strain. One paraphrase loop—“patterns came to die and be reborn” echoes “cycles” trope but serves cadence, forgiven at distance from closure. Clean grammar, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, and tactile detail. Metaphors stay coherent—vortex as warlike serenity, seed as hunger for life—without purple overload. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety mirrors emotional swell. One buried clause mid-vortex (“trees within its grasp bending and unbending”) could be sharper, but clarity never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is botanical: long twisting vines of subordinate clauses break into staccato pulses at portal threshold. Information density is high—each sentence performs world-building, metaphor, and kinesthetic cue simultaneously. Only blemish: triple repetition of “jagged” within 40 words creates a micro-loop that momentarily stalls the final thrust. Otherwise, no scaffold, no synonym churn, and the closing star-line is lean enough to punch through the eclipse.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often does two jobs—“roots twisted into a natural altar” anchors setting + objects. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (roots as friends, silver as meaning). One near-muddle: “catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones” risks mixed metaphor, but the physical logic holds—roots literally thread skeletal gaps. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating echo without monotony. Clean grammar and tense.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence (“He needed to discover purpose after loss…”) compresses backstory and want without scaffolding. Figurative control avoids mixed metaphors—tube amp hum stays sonic, never becomes light. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift. Rhythm accelerates into noun-phrase fragments under memory pressure, then exhales into the long final sentence that mirrors valley echo, showing sentence-level propulsion aligned to emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “metallic leaves grew from suspended soil” packs world, image, and stakes in one stroke. Few filters, no synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (transition = translation). One scaffold trace—“the touching distance she felt from Hamid”—is repeated in closing line; intentional echo earns waiver, but still slightly dulls sonic freshness. Otherwise clean grammar, varied sentence lengths, and strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence variety avoids template; information dense—one line can layer sensory cue, world rule, and metaphor. Minor paraphrase loop “gleaming like distant memories… gleaming with the same winter light” (−0.2). Figurative language disciplined, never floods high-pressure beats. Opening line anchors voice & stakes; final line resolves via image that re-cues “after tomorrow disappears.” No scaffold clutter; pronouns & tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or emotional charge; no filler. Metaphors are clean—“crystal caves…holding their breath”—and never mixed. Rhythm varies: opening caesura-like list, then accelerating cadence toward communal climax. Minor template echo (“the inspector…” x3) but insufficient to dull momentum or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density: one sentence often layers action, metaphor, and emotional state. Rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks at emotional pivots. Occasional modifier stacks (“raw solace,” “relentless heart”) flirt with purple but stay within POV lexicon. No loops, no template cadence; closure image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm is deliberate incantation; repetitions (“documented frantically,” “backward cycle”) serve accumulative pulse rather than accidental template. High metaphor density is justified by dream-mode, yet occasional stacks (“waves breaking on distant shores” inside a mist library) flirt with excess. No paraphrase loops; sentences carry double duty (image + motion). Copy is clean; opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line releases with resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud cadence is varied; paragraph breath matches beats of authentication, decision, disappearance. No paraphrase loops—each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors are coherent: “mulberry ache” stays taste-based; “velvet observatory” remains tactile dome. Information density high: one line can do description + telepathy + foreshadowing (“the voices of ancient specimens pressed against her consciousness”). Minor lushness in “impossible color” is earned by refractive logic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long creaming sentences for aurora, staccato bursts for static crackle. Figurative control is extreme: no mixed metaphors, no modifier stacks. One scaffold loop spotted—“the silence of the dead” twice in four lines—drops the score a hair. Otherwise information is dense: one sentence can layer tool-action, sensory input, and metaphysical stakes without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and musical—“steps scalloping softly,” “vineyard hush”—with only minor loops (“cycle of rebirth” echo); metaphors stay coherent, no scaffold obscures closure, and final line lands clean, though occasional adjective stacks flirt with purple.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“cloak of doubt” introduced early), and paid off in final mantle image. High information density: “campfire…surrendered its last spark” compresses time, signals appointment. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for wind swell, then stark “Thank you” to close.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length modulates from long, hypnotic accumulations to the single-word exhalation “Oh” at the climax, mirroring ripple expansion/contraction. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language is patterned—stone/ripple/grotto/starlight form a closed metaphor set—so density feels earned, not purple. Zero filter-verb stacks; immediacy is sustained through tactile verbs (“traced,” “hunched,” “snapped”). Final line lands on monosyllabic stillness that recharges the opening hush, achieving cadence symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet airy—information dual-tasking every line. No loops; “stone” recurs with shifting charge. Metaphor vehicles stay physical (ink-splash crows, vortex of feathers) and coherent. Minor over-modification: “river-washed surface of a flat stone” could trim, but momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences deliver setting, backstory, and stakes (“automated magical systems hummed their perfect, soulless melodies”). Varied sentence openers; no scaffold loops. Metaphors (golden haze as honey) stay consistent and physically coherent. One mixed image—“world tilted sideways—not physically but metaphysically”—is earned by context. Pronouns clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; every sentence at least dual-task (lighting lamp + hiding motive). Figurative language is sparse, deliberate: “paper globes like captured stars” teaches lantern = cosmic vow motif. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds (rope stays taut, key turns clockwise). High density: 723 words yet spans years of obsession, one ritual night, irreversible perceptual change. Final line “amber and rose against the morning sky” crystallizes closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and lyrical; figurative language appears sparingly and always in service of the reversed-time conceit. No paraphrase loops or template cadences; sentences vary in length and opening, creating an elegiac rhythm that accelerates slightly toward the collapse. Occasional nominalizations (“wavelength align,” “conceptual repricing”) are justified by the scientific register Elara would plausibly use. A single mixed image—“coins whispered… spoke”—is minor; it does not obscure causality or dull the final line, keeping the piece within the 8+ band for line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates from long, dusk-heavy sentences to staccato naming beats, accelerating as crystals form. Information density is high: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and mythic work without redundancy. No mixed metaphors; light → crystal → scar is a single coherent vehicle. Minor scaffold: “the reaper’s X” opener appears three times but serves as ritual cadence, not clutter, and is pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “crystalline arches refracting the first light into a thousand fractured rainbows” packs sight, motion, and metaphor in one breath. No synonym churn or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or interiority. One micro-loop: “his earnestly naive hope renewed” re-uses the exact adjective pair from the opening; while thematically circular, the repetition is intentional and brief enough to avoid momentum drag. The final line—“leaving the bell to its silent vigil over a world slowly, impossibly, healing”—lands with cadence-perfect closure weight.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“the aroma of anise and regret rising in the still air”). No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent—reservoir as bruised moon, photos as fallen stars—without mixed logic. Zero scaffolding; each paragraph advances placement or memory. Closure line breathes cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “shattered light into a million dancing prisms” risks cliché yet is redeemed by immediate instrumental use—she reads the prisms for calibration data. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances instrument, perception, or stake. One mixed metaphor—“orchestra to its conductor” applied to gardens—passes quickly enough not to dull the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm modulates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lines routinely double duty: “The parachute buckle had once belonged to someone else—someone who’d jumped and never return” seeds backstory, object history, and stakes in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each spiral reference adds new sensory angle (braille, chill, pendulum). Figurative layering is patterned, not piled—mixed metaphors avoided. One clause of slight overstuff: “archipelago in a sea of fog” survives because it is the only visual panorama before immediate bodily action re-anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: “history rewriting itself, stars realigning” compresses cosmic stakes without exposition. Mixed metaphors minimal; “cold blanket of numbness” is stock but isolated. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. One adjectival stack (“perfect, steady beat”) in closure beat but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence craft is lean and double-tasking: “the storm-born silence that followed a summer downpour settled over the valley” marries weather, mood, and sonic echo in one stroke. No loops, no mixed metaphors; informational density stays high without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Density is high: “mournfully eager” carries contradiction in two words; “macerate the memory” fuses tender culinary verb with geologic substrate. No mixed metaphors—vehicles of wind, sound, and geology stay coherent. One paraphrase loop spotted: “the silence that remained was different, softer” immediately after “the silence was almost deafening,” but the second line reweights the first, earning its keep. Rhythm modulates from jack-hammer anaphora to the hush of single-sentence coda.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly figured yet purposeful; metaphor density serves the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or internalization. Occasional stacked modifiers (“gray luminescence that filtered through the gloom”) risk purple, but the hypnotic rhythm earns them. Closing cadence slows clauses to mirror pendant’s dimming—line-level craft supports closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—ember nexus as both literal furnace and cosmic philosophy—yet never muddles causality. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory detail, backstory shard, and emotional turn. Minor scaffold: “successive approximation” phrase repeats 5×; since pattern is thematic spine, not accidental, deduction minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; most sentences carry dual duty (e.g., “copper glinting serenely electric under the lunar perigee’s oversized glare”). Two adjacent near-paraphrases—“the shard of hush that promised answers” / “the shard of hush now a part of him”—create mild echo; not at closure. Mixed metaphors avoided. No template cadence, no scaffold loops in final third. Clean grammar, tactile specificity, strong read-aloud rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is restrained—prismatic starlight, multiversal ocean—never clogs the merger beat. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal accelerator,” “harmonic convergence”) is justified by concept-driven lens. One mixed micro-metaphor: “timelines knitting through the soles of his boots” is vivid enough to pass.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pressure—short clauses at collapse, longer braided sentences during weaving. Metaphors stay coherent (thread as moonlight, corridor as storm-memory) without mixed-vehicle clashes. No synonym churn or template cadence; each sentence advances image or causality. Minor scaffold: “the texture of connection now” momentarily abstracts, but is immediately grounded in tactile “frayed, knotted, alive,” so clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Information density high: one sentence can anchor body, tool, and heritage. Only micro-loop: “luminous spires… filtered daylight” sits near “bioluminescent corals… pulsed with gentle light” in adjacent paragraphs—slight shimmer surplus. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges anchor/bridge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; sentences multitask (“she worked during the most mysterious hour—when the dead called out to the living”). Minor loop: “persistent/persistently” appears three times in close proximity, and “pulses” is over-leveraged. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding that obscures causality. Final third is clean; artifacts do not touch closure. High density, strong read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence delivers setting, sense anomaly, and stakes (“water… thicker… transitioning between states”). Occasional poetic overlay (“electric serpents,” “quantum ghosts”) but metaphors consistent with tech-horror tone and never muddle causality. Minimal scaffold; no paraphrase loops. Final third clean—closure beat crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is velvet-dense yet propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are purposeful—“captured dawn in moonlight” twins luminescences to echo digital/organic doubling. Sentence rhythm accelerates with heartbeat spikes, breathes with snowfall pauses. Filter verbs serve voice: “he admitted” embeds monitor habit. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean, monosyllabic drop.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric density occasionally flirts with purple excess (“rainbows that touched the canyon walls like liquid sound”) but rhythm modulates with scene breath; no loops, scaffold, or register drift; information dense, propelling toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong density—earth/mint juxtapose regret/absurdity in single phrases; most sentences do two jobs. Metaphors stay internally consistent (gravity = levity). Minor scaffold: “static-laden confessions” is repeated almost verbatim within 30 words; a −0.2 loop. No mixed metaphors or register drift; final image breathes without overwriting. Rhythm modulates from long clauses underground to staccato phone bursts, supporting momentum rather than showing off.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: “locust’s memory of winged escape warming her ribs” does three jobs (object, emotion, foreshadow) in one breath. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (sound as tide, glass cracked by laughter). Two near-simultaneous participle openers in climax but cadence mirrors musical acceleration, reading as purposeful texture rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is textured and propulsive; sentences open varied, information dual-loaded (“glided from one side of the chasm to the other” embeds geography and peril). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay consistent (storm↔pulse, ghosts↔neon). Two near-simultaneous “soft sigh” / “soft” dock within two lines—minor echo, not fatal. Closure sentence breathes cleanly. Errors: present tense once shifts to past (“had helped”)—correct; otherwise copy-clean. Within high band but not 9+ because figurative height in peak beat (“glass coffins…brittle hush”) slightly overwrites the EM-pulse practicality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the emotional arc: long, vowel-rich clauses in discovery tighten to staccato when he sings. Figurative language is spare—only the halo “pulsed with increasing intensity”—so no metaphor pile-up dulls the climax. One paraphrase loop detected (“silence had become both his language and his canvas” echoes two sentences later) but it does not recur in the finale. High information density: each sentence carries sensory, emotional, and causal payload.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances world or want. Mixed metaphors are deliberate and coherent (“hyperbolic space…each curve a line of poetry”) paid off by portal geometry. Information density high: one sentence can set, characterize, and foreshadow (“the scarf, like her, was a relic of a time when stories were tactile”). No artifact intrusion in closure beat: final line breathes cleanly. Opening and closing lines function as symmetrical narrative hinges without drum-beat cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; metaphor density peaks in the opening 100 words, risking purple, but pattern is taught early and paid off. Occasional soft repeats—“light” appears 8× in 800 words—create shimmer rather than loop. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final third stays legible, allowing 8-band, but “luminous absence” phrase recurs without fresh inflection, holding it below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose density is high: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work without scaffold. Metaphors (“pressure valve across decades”) stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from patient mountain sentences to staccato “snap…flooded…crashed” at release, ear-test passed. Only micro-slip: “the feeling of enveloped secrets intensified” repeats “enveloped” concept; prune one for 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “glass fractured into something resembling ancient star charts” packs visual, tactile, mythic data in one stroke. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new angle on light-water-mushroom triad. One near-purple patch—“decades later…where morning and evening can occupy the same moment”—but pattern is taught early and pays off, so forgiven. Final line cadence echoes opening boots-on-gravel crunch, giving circular music.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: sinuous alliterative runs (“shard-mirror archivist paced”) alternate with staccato release (“now come home”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new information or image. Metaphors are coherent—shadow as captive, tea leaves as map—without mixed logic. One minor scaffold: “the method had been her own creation” could compress, but it does not touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean; pronouns and tense stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, with only minor scaffold: “the thunderous roar…profound silence she inhabited” is a near-paraphrase but occurs early and does not stall closure. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent under accumulative lens; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high—each sentence performs sensory + causal work. No artifacts appear in the final third; 9+ remains eligible.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or procedure; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (vault = question-mark ceiling, silence = map). Minor overwrought cluster in paragraph 3 (“visual cadence resonated… shadow that moved without source”) knocks 0.3; still clear and propulsive. Final image is crisp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; metaphors are spare and coherent (“voice as hollow as a shipwrecked bell”). No loops or scaffold; sentences do double duty. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines anchor and release with mirror-craft. Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” is justified by Elias’s scholar-bent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    Read-aloud cadence pleasing, but occasional modifier stacks (“white sea of vapor,” “weathered hands,” “timeless moment”) create micro-redundancy. No hard loops; however, “weathered features / weathered hands” within 30 words is near-paraphrase. Punctuation clean, sentences varied; high metaphor density tolerated because pattern is storm-sensory. Closure line earns its brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, clear, and propulsive; sentences vary; little scaffold. Minor synonym loops (“scattered light” triple-tap) and one mixed timeline (“had been preparing her specifically for this moment”) momentarily lift causality into flashback ether, but clarity recovers. No cluttered metaphors; compression suits elevator countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is patterned—“quietly explosive” recurs with payoff in final cloud circle—so density penalty waived. High information density: each cloud name carries meteorological precision + emotional weight. Zero scaffold loops; no synonym churn. “Spooled wholeness” risks abstraction but is grounded in cable/thread imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm is varied, sentences doing double duty: “He traced the grain…his fingers memorizing textures his eyes could not” advances setting + character in one breath. Occasional scaffold—“the library trembled…inside the sky held steady”—is justified by the situational lens. Metaphors stay coherent (sky inside wood) and do not congest the climax. Two near-paraphrase lines (“He walked away…He walked on”) appear in the denouement, a minor loop that does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose propels: each sentence either advances discovery or tightens atmosphere. No filter-verb clusters or cliché loops; metaphors (“cradle for his breakthrough thoughts”) are sparse and purposeful. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—longer cadence for drifting airship, staccato when starlings explode into pattern. One mixed metaphor (“captured what…still journeying”) is minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract during mirror-blindness, lengthen during thaw. No scaffold loops; each descriptor (“crystalline windows,” “brass and steel components”) does fresh spatial work. Mixed-metaphor risk in “driftwood nostalgia” is accepted because it teaches tone early and pays off in final warmth. Information density high—single sentences deliver setting, mood, and bodily stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean: zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, strong verbs (“shimmer,” “race,” “pulse”). Information density is high—each sentence either advances discovery or adds sensory layer. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line resolves by image (“cosmic wink”) that recharges earlier nebula. Two minor scaffolding traces: “for months following” is transit summary, and “years later” is a leap that could use one bridging clause, but both are strategic compressions, not artifacts. Closure beat is untouched; deduction is −0.2 for near-simultaneous “would continue / would fail” conditional pair; still lands above 8.2 cap for 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is densely figurative but pattern-driven, not overwritten: the spirals and nested motifs justify the cadence. A few phrases edge toward poetic template (“across the hush of what had once been time”) yet serve the accumulative design. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops; information density remains high. The final clause “nested patterns preserving a lullaby” is a concise closure recharge that avoids explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, high density (“wires woven from strands of moonlight” does triple duty), no scaffold loops; one mixed metaphor (“blue light that cast shadows like reaching arms”) slightly blurs physics but occurs pre-closure and doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; most sentences advance both image and causality. Minor scaffold: “the polymer chemist…,” “the symphonically minded chemist…” repeated openers create template cadence (−0.2). Figurative density high but patterned early, so allowed. No mixed metaphors; river/foam logic stays physical. Final line avoids explain-everything; ends on image. Clean grammar and pronoun reference.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “crystalline branches heavy with books that hummed” does triple sensory work. Occasional soft filler—“his clean slate ready for the next customer”—but no loops or mixed metaphors. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“incised,” “swirled,” “gleaming”) propel. Final line mirrors opener with cadence shift, supplying quiet closure. High-band, but one template cadence run (“The woman nodded again… The young man nodded…”) blocks 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, pressure, or interiority. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent—“sandpaper rough memories,” “remorse collected like seafoam”—and never mixed. High information density: one line can anchor setting, backstory, and emotional state. No filter-verb stacks or scaffolding. Opening line anchors voice and mythic stake; final line resolves by image that recharges “salt on tongue.” Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts pass—removing any would drop sensory or causal data.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty: “Under the hush of borrowed starlight filtering through the tower's celestial dials, Elara prepared...” sets scene, tone, and stakes in one breath. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors (“voices—like knowledge—meant to be shared”) are spare and coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Zero grammar, simultaneity, or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences often couple world-building with interiority (“moonlight carved the canyon into infinite shadows and possibilities”). Mixed-metaphor risk (“sugar in hot water” for ego dissolution) is minor and apt. Paraphrase loops are minimal; only slight scaffold is the repeated “archeologist of abandoned dreams” tag. Filter-verb clusters absent; temporal sequencing clean; closing image lands with sharp, breath-held cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density; sentences advance multiple jobs (“gravity began its strange inversion—light objects becoming heavy, her body wanting to drift upward while stones rose”). Minor template cadence in “she would need to protect…” trio, but does not touch closure. Mixed-metaphor risk (“architecture of reality recalibrate”) is justified by prism-mind frame. Proofreading clean; no loops in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“porcelain insulator… would bridge the gap”). No scaffold, loops, or paraphrase. Metaphors stay coherent: sound as textile, silence as fabric. One mixed vehicle—“steps softer than the hedgehog’s uncurling dusk”—but the lyric pattern justifies it and it does not touch closure. Register stable; no thesaurus-itis. Final line is crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, high density; each sentence layers tactile detail or metaphor without scaffold. Mixed-metaphor watch: “tension before a championship match” beside “magnetic nexus” stays coherent. One paraphrase loop: “discover beauty in the difficult circumstances that had defined his exile” restates prior beat. Final paragraph rhythm accelerates into closure without clutter, earning upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet rhythmic: “oscilloscopes, tuning forks, frequency generators, and an absurd collection of listening devices” packs four tools into one breath without clutter. Metaphors are precise—silence as “mathematical precision” versus “artistic intuition”—and never mixed. One near-loop: “theatrical yet sincere” is reused; otherwise no synonym churn. Final sentence is a controlled crescendo that lands on image, not explanation. Read-aloud ear test passes; cadence modulates from languid to staccato as fireworks approach.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; sentence rhythm mirrors seasonal accumulation without monotony. Metaphors are spare and anchored (moonlit web, tide’s thought) rather than stacked. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances archive, scent, or social encroachment. Opening and closing lines bookend with rope ladder and seed dispersal, creating cadence symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong nouns/verbs—“corrugated surfaces,” “affixed sensors”—minimize adjectival bloat. Occasional stacked prepositional phrases (“within the steel canyon”) slightly dilute propulsion but never obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final sentence cadence earns its weight, re-charging silence motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: clauses swell and ebb like the piece they describe. Occasional stacked metaphors in peak beat (“kaleidoscope of sound and light”) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and pays off at closure, so −0.3 only. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory angle or causal nudge. Tense stable, pronouns clean, no simultaneity errors; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is textured but disciplined: metaphor chains (“avalanchingly quiet,” “wounded spirits”) stay coherent and sensical within the fantasy aura. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Occasional elevated diction (“guardianship ended,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register above the Keeper’s likely idiom, but the mythic tone justifies it. Momentum stays high; each paragraph advances either spatial progress or metaphysical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies; figurative layer is dense yet patterned—fractured light, constellations of type—without obscuring causality. A few scaffold phrases (“between vanishing stars” repeated) and one mixed metaphor (“sugar in water” for crystal dissolution) dull precision, but artifacts do not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary and paragraphing tracks emotional breath. Figurative language is dense (aurora “like a ribbon of liquid silver”) but patterned and consistent with the courier’s heightened perception. A few near-redundant phrases (“echo with the weight,” “vanished like morning mist”) mildly dull propulsion. No loops or mixed metaphors touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; figurative layers serve hush-building rather than ornament for its own sake. No template cadence or synonym loops; each metaphor extends the conceit (frost as stanza, battlefield). Filter-verb count low; perception rendered directly (“prism cold against fingertips”). One paraphrase risk: “patience that was almost tactile / almost impossible” could compress, but cadence supports breathlessness. Final line returns to concrete image, avoiding abstract summary. Copy-clean; no tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric cadences collapse into staccato “wait.” Information density high—single sentences splice memory, plea, and physical toll. Metaphors stay internally coherent (silence as textile) and physically tracked. Minor scaffold in “the silence wasn’t empty, she realized” could compress, but artifact does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety supports propulsion: short bursts for underground labor, longer lyrical coils for dawn reveal. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances choice or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor river/liquid night is allowed for pattern consistency. Minor density spike—“azure defiance” repeated—but it pays off in final image, so forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory map, motivation, and world history (“ghosts of machinery…murder of half-remembered dreams”). Metaphors are controlled; no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase loop on “withheld truth” phrase costs −0.2. Opening and closing lines are sharply cadenced, propelling entry and exit. Read-aloud ear test passes; only hairline repetitions keep it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job—description, interior, and motion: “his boat slicing / the lamp cold / ghosts leaning.” Metaphors are spare, sea-worn, never purple: “lighthouse stood like a sentinel” is allowed cliché because it is Jonah’s own internal shorthand. Opening and closing lines carry symmetrical salt-rhythm that booksends the voyage. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; openings rotate to avoid template monotony. Some metaphor layering approaches purple (“memories of futures not yet born”) yet stays coherent under lyrical lens. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected; information density is high. Closure line breathes cleanly, achieving image-led cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; only one scaffold loop (“sun trails… sun trails” across adjacent clauses) and a single mixed metaphor (“quietly explosive” used twice) but neither touches the closure beat; high information ratio, strong verbs, no filter-verb clot.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, vivid, loop-free until the final clause (“ordinary miracle of this knowledge”) which slightly abstracts the preceding concrete image. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences. Information density is high—each sentence advances tool, dream, or tree data. The near-miss on 8.8 is the single conceptual summary in the last line; trimming it would leave pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vivid figurative density supports mythic mode; only one mixed metaphor (“seams of gold stitching… reality”) under peak beat. Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences open with body, tool, image, avoiding template loops. Minor filter verb cluster “he could coax…he could swaddle” rescued by tactile immediacy that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—clipped as midnight nears, expansive during reflection. Figurative language sparse and precise (“streetlights cast gentle patterns”). No mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “nested paradoxes” appears twice without new angle (−0.2). Information density high; sentences multitask. Opening line anchors stakes and voice. Final line resolves by image. Proofing clean. Closure beat untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence rhythm mirrors breath, paragraph cuts tighten toward final chirp. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor. Density high—“bread…perfect map of forgotten streets” does two jobs. One near-filter verb cluster mid-seed-planting but does not stall closure. Opening & final line frame and recharge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic drum; each sentence advances task or cold. Only micro-loop: “luminous vows” appears four times—yet each recurrence tracks brightness drop, so serves pattern. Metaphors (quartz hush, dying star) stay consistent with frozen glass motif; no mixed vehicles. High density, zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm steady; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and safe—“echoed like distant thunder” is shopworn but brief. Information density decent: one sentence often advances plot + atmosphere. Passive voice minimal. Copy clean; no typos. Micro-redundancy: “rotting timbers above” appears twice in 800 words; a small −0.2. Closure beat is clear and unpadded.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry dual duty: “tin compass ring absorbed the familiar glow, spinning without direction” fuses object, light, and tension in one clause. No synonym loops; “luminous,” “amber,” “blue” are chromatic anchors, not churn. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“taste of honey as his calm presence sweetened the air”—and avoids mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with aurora pulses, propelling toward the final stillness without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence performs double duty (image + interior move). Metaphors are coherent—charcoal as needle, memories as lava—without mixed vehicles. Information density peaks when three senses (grit, glare, echo) compress into one line at the first stroke. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp; no fat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density: one sentence often paints setting + emotion + stakes. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Scaffold minimal—only one paraphrase loop (“lost conversations… silenced conversations”). Occasional elevated register (“conceptual cost,” “conceptual repricing”) momentarily cracks POV lexicon, but beats are short. Clean copy; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long, cloud-wreathed clauses to hammer-blow fragments, mirroring the shift from contemplation to vibration. Two mixed metaphors—“cold trying to speak,” “sunrise buried for centuries”—soften clarity but fit the lyric license. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances light, sound, or motion. Minor redundancy: “glisten-ing” hyphenated twice, probably artifact; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, with high information density—each neighbor vignette advances pattern. Occasional softening filters (“seemed,” “felt like”) dull one or two peak beats; no mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality. A single paraphrase loop (“stories waiting to be told… stories waiting to be heard”) knocks back from 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies: long liquid clauses mirror underwater drift, then shorten at alarm beat. Information density high—“spider web patterns that measured her remaining time” packs metaphor, clock, and stakes into one line. No paraphrase loops; however, three successive “She…” openers in paragraph 5 create template cadence that dulls propulsion. Mixed-metaphor risk: “lyrical code breaker,” “hangman’s dice,” “ballet of decryption” stacked in same breath, yet coherence survives because pattern is taught early and paid off in dance sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is textured yet propulsive: “gravity pocket shifted around her, the air thick with potential energy” compresses two senses into one rhythmic clause. No synonym loops or scaffold. Metaphors (petals as ghosts, crystals as lenses) stay consistent with physics of light and memory. Minor alliteration (“gleaming silence”) is purposeful, echoing crystal facets.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    High metaphor density in every sentence risks purple overlap, yet pattern is taught early (“creased edges sharp as starlight”) and mostly coherent. One mixed metaphor: “hour stretched taut like a drawn bow” alongside “smoothed hush” later—tension vs. smoothing—creates micro-friction. Paraphrase loops minor: “the brook’s soft rush was the last thread of noise… the brook resumed its murmur” restates function. Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic; information density is poetic rather than propulsive, acceptable under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances image or pressure; no scaffold or synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and coherent—meteor streaks as sealing wax, bricks softening like old men—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm mirrors pulse of disclosure: longer clauses for star-drifts, clipped fragments when seal flares. Opening line anchors voice and object; final line recharges sugar motif with crisp release. One near-simultaneity—“she smiled, though her heart raced”—drops this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from languid twilight cadences to staccato activations, supporting nocturnal tempo. High information density: one line often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“velvet petals…absorbing the emotional frequencies”). Metaphors are coherent—sound as light, memory as wave—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances grid or grief. Read-aloud ear test passes: no template cadence. Minor scaffold: “resonance structures” repeated three times in close succession (−0.2), but pattern taught early and serves ritual refrain, so artifact does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Density high: vellum/quill/ink/wax all work double duty as tactile detail and plot gear. Single mixed metaphor—“memories surfaced like drowning bodies”—but it is brief and fits emotional register. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges thorn and unlink motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, or shell mythos. Zero paraphrase loops; no “the canyon was old and ancient” churn. Metaphors stay coherent—nexus as conduit, web as strata—without mixed vehicles. Opening and final lines are image-anchors, not scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence can layer globe handling, breath fog, and ghost fatigue. Metaphors are spare and coherent—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts land on micro-turns. Minor scaffold: “always more stories waiting beneath the surface” edges toward template, but it is isolated and does not dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud cadence is musical without drumbeat repetition; sentence openings vary. Information density is high—each sentence adds image or motion. One minor loop: “hidden effort that stitched the world together” is conceptually restated three times in different guises. No metaphors clash; “moon paths” extends cleanly from firefly light. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No mixed metaphors or loops, but two near-paraphrase pairs (“truth…comfortable narratives / comfortable lies”) dull momentum slightly. Density is high; every paragraph advances knowledge or image. Artifacts stay clear of closure beat, so 9+ not disallowed, yet the slight repetition caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: “cobalt glass portico trembled as lightning struck nearby, its deep blue suddenly luminous with captured storm energy” does three jobs—sensory, plot, symbol. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed metaphor—“map drawn in static”—but cleared immediately by radio imagery. Final line cadence matches quiet resignation. Minor: occasional adjective padding (“weathered notebooks”) could trim.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    Figurative language is selective, never clustering more than two metaphors per high-pressure sentence; vehicles stay coherent (rope → regret → honey). Rhythm modulates: elongated sentences for dune vastness, staccato for music-box death. One scaffold phrase—“lonesome splendor” repeated—earns its echo by closure. No synonym loops or template cadence; information density is high (one line often layers sound, object, and emotional state).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; most sentences do two jobs (image + causality). A few metaphor stacks (“jagged, silvery landscape that seemed to hum…”) flirt with overwriting but serve the lyric mode. No synonym loops or template cadence; openings vary. Minor scaffold: “the key began to warm… began to…” could compress. Closure image is sharp and uncluttered, sustaining high-band readability with only hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, but occasional modifier stacks (“softly purposeful movements,” “restrained wildness”) edge toward purple. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Metaphors are coherent though sometimes abstract; closure image remains clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density: single sentences often do double duty (“the lantern’s glow seemed to reverberate through the tunnel, each pulse a reminder…”). Only minor scaffold: two instances of “seemed to” which slightly hedge sensory certainty. Mixed metaphor count is low; one possible clash—“pendulum counting down to unspoken truth”—is acceptable given POV’s analytic mindset. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths create visual breathing space before and after graffiti beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “light can break through storm clouds” carries double duty—literal optic and thematic rupture. No filler loops; each sentence advances knowledge or menace. Metaphors are spare, mechanically apt (“lodged in Elias’s mind like a splinter”). One near-purple phrase—“the vibrant hush of the room pressed in”—is earned by prior sonic seeding. Clause rhythm varies; no template cadence clutter. Closing image—“quiet, determined steps of redemption”—avages explanation, trusts the ticking box to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythmic control is evident: clause-stacked sentences mirror gearwork but never stall momentum. Mixed metaphors (“consciousness...into something resembling desire”) are minor. Filter-verb clusters absent; sentences open with varied agents. Information density high—each paragraph advances plot or reveals world. A faint loop of “acid sea” repetition costs a hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: each sentence advances clue or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: “his days spent excavating…his nights haunted…” is a template cadence; not in closure. Metaphors are controlled (“ghost in the machine”) and consistent. No loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“reality slipping like sand” appears once and pays off in the water-cupped hands final image. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, interior shift, and object cue. No scaffold; even reflective lines advance stance. Minor alliteration in “salt, sorrow, strange, clean scent” reads intentional, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length; information density is high—each line advances image or emotional tilt. Minor loop: “the sentinel… the sentinel…” openings in paragraph 1, but pattern breaks quickly. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Clean copy; one typo (“edge” repeated) does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero paraphrase loops, metaphors stay internally consistent (sand / silk / crystal). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes closure. Filter verbs appear only when the walker literally filters whispers through peripheral awareness—motivated, not slack. A single strained phrase—“kinetic parapet beneath the dunes”—initially jars, but the conceit is immediately embodied by gear-grind sound and is forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence layers scent, object, or emotional physics. Metaphors (nest/heart/wings) converge cleanly at climax without mixed logic. No synonym loops; “arc” repeats only when the pattern demands it. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propulsive. A single paraphrase loop—“a lullaby of survival” immediately after “hummed a lullaby”—drops the score a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: “salvaged from the library’s grand fixture before it was disassembled for scrap” supplies history and scarcity in one line. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, stakes, or sound. Metaphors precise: “first light finger the spines” (synesthetic), “crystal had testified” (organic personification). No mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines echo glass/hush without repetition. Read-aloud rhythm varied.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the fog—long exhalations of description punctuated by the chalk’s short scrape. Figurative layers (sandbar mind, tidal longing) recur with variation, never stacking into purple. One paraphrase loop—“the sound of growing older… the sound of time settling”—is forgiven because the reprise reweights meaning at closure. Otherwise, high density, zero scaffolding, clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric glide (“the observatory… the clock… the leaf…”) gives way to staccato crash beats. Information density high—single sentences layer tool, body, stakes. One paraphrase loop (“luminous ache” repeated twice) but occurs outside closure beat; −0.3 applied. No metaphor clash; lunar vacuum and leaf whisper cohere as conceptual contrast. Minor scaffold: “its silver dome catching the light” appears twice—accept as motif reprise, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, mostly propulsive, but relies on several stock stems (“the weight of the moment,” “pulsing stillness,” “scent of hope”) that blunt specificity. One paraphrase loop: “executing a flawless goodbye” echoed as “execute a flawless goodbye.” Mixed metaphor risk in “clouds blushed with pink” is minor. No closure obscurity; density sufficient; artifact presence keeps this from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“stars … like shattered glass” is single, apt simile. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and tactile stakes; final line resolves with charged key and drifting isle, re-echoing “quietly deliberate.” One minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” diction slightly above POV, but occurs once and does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“starlight dripped”—and never muddies causality. High information density: tooth, corpse, garden, child, surrender in <800 words. Zero scaffolding; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: “coiled like a sleeping serpent” packs place + threat + beauty in five words. No paraphrase loops; each polish stroke adds new sensory angle. Metaphors consistent—sea, sky, breath—no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraph cuts purposeful. Minor scaffold: “memories resurface” twice in opening; does not obscure causality or dull closure. No artifact in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is clean: zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, strong verbs (“draped,” “traced,” “refracting”). Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, emotion). Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph breaks mirror attention shifts. No filler stacks or filter verbs in peak beat. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motif; final sentence propels outward without overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lush figurative density risks purple in spots (“molten silver forming impossible geometry”), yet stays aligned with dream-logic rule-set. One paraphrase loop detected: “steps confident across shifting sands where reality bent” repeats bent-reality notion within three lines. No mixed metaphors; time-sequence is clean. Opening and closing lines are sharp; middle contains minor scaffold (“each moment stretching according to need”). Overall propulsion maintained; artifacts never touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative density is high but patterned—moon-threads, vine-tendrils, golden pools—taught early and reprised at closure, so the lyric overlay earns its place. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; “golden stories” recurs with deliberate choral effect. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “his fingers… his heart… his hands” triplets could be trimmed, but they occur pre-closure and do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean-lyric: every sentence adds image or procedure; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“starlight spread...like something both alive and sentient”—avoiding mixed vehicles. One minor template cadence (“Kaelen...withdrew...then removed...then carefully tipped...”) but it occurs mid-ritual, echoing ceremonial steps without dulling momentum. Line-level craft is confident, only hairline short of 9.0 due to slight surplus of participial openers.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: “He fitted brass custom-worked components, adjusted resonant frequencies, calibrated…” carries three jobs in one line. Figurative control is tight—echoes as condensation, cellar of reason—without mixed-metaphor clutter. One minor loop: “wounded season” is repeated three times in close proximity; trimming one would sharpen. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks; the final image lands clean and luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is dense but controlled: “kerosene lamp burner cast erratic shadows” (precise noun stack), “ribbons of starlight filtering through unseen cracks” (visual metaphor without purple). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. The only micro-drag is occasional stacked modifiers in mid-paragraph, but they never obscure the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, mirroring the grotto’s recursive hush.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long syntactic curls for contemplation, short chips for cuts. Information dense—“ash wood carving blank sat squarely…devoid of the story it would soon contain” does triple duty (object, emotion, foreshadow). Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors consistent (rain=lenses, shavings=snow) and physically coherent. Minor elevated register (“autumnal rust-hued peace”) is earned by reflective mode. No artifacts touch closure beat; final line lands clean. High-band entry but not immaculate—one near-cliché “miniature lens” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “carousel horse, frozen mid-rear” does triple duty—setting, symbol, mirror—in five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, motion, or knowledge. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“kinetic lagoon hummed” remains audible motion, not mixed vehicle. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo—“hummed above” vs “hummed its farewell”—pattern taught and paid.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density high: one sentence often fuses action, tool detail, and metaphor (“its curved edge catching the dim light like a sliver of a captured star”). No paraphrase loops; each groove/water/trace mention advances the pattern. Rhythm breathes—long cadence for wonder, hammer-tap for valve turns. Minor filter verbs (“she watched”) appear twice but do not stall momentum; no figurative muddle in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm breath-syncs with content—long humid clauses yield to clipped droplet fragments. Figurative language sparse and coherent; no metaphor muddle. One paraphrase loop (“excruciatingly gentle” x4) deducts −0.3, but pattern is purposeful, not scaffold. High density achieved: each sentence advances either sensory data or interior shift.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do double duty: “The lie…had funded his expeditions and defined his purpose” compresses biography and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical or emotional info. Metaphor is spare and physical—“skeleton of the fabled wagon”—never purple. Final paragraph risks two abstractions back-to-back but saves itself with tactile radio crackle. Clean grammar, no scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence varies: long anaphoric fog lines alternate with crisp knot verbs. Information density high—most sentences deliver sensory data plus symbolic load. Two mixed-metaphor hazards: “lightning’s frozen scream” and “library” for rope verge on excess but serve concept. Minor scaffold: “the fog swirled” appears twice within eight lines; doesn’t obscure closure but keeps score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose breathes with scene tempo: longer cadence for twilight bloom, single crisp beat when thread catches starlight. Figurative control high—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Density strong: one sentence often fuses setting, emotion, and concept (“Writing obituaries…integration—the geography of understanding…”). Minor scaffold: “explained absences” repeated exact phrase three times; does not touch closure, so −0.2 only. Elsewhere, verbs are strong, pronouns clean, no filter-stack.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong nouns/verbs (“stalactite anchors snapped”) carry momentum; only minor scaffold (“quaking reverie” repeated thrice). One paraphrase loop (“beautifully painful / painfully sweet”) survives cut-test. Mixed metaphors avoided; physical logic consistent. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful. Final third free of artifacts, preserving 9-band eligibility elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: varied sentence openings, strategic breathers after long clauses, no template cadence. Figurative language is dense yet precise—“sky emptied as the last of the migrating geese paused their clamorous flight” layers motion and silence in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances either atmosphere or causality. Copy is clean; no tense drift, no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rich but borders on overwritten in the sustained metaphor streak across high-pressure beats (“river of memories,” “silent prayers,” “comet tails”). No loops; sentences vary; diction precise. One paraphrase duo (“garden sighed, once and for all, into being”) slightly dulls the final image, preventing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty: advance hand motion, shade mood, seed metaphor without purple drift. No template cadence; openings vary from participial breeze to noun-edged declaratives. Figurative layer (“ribbon...dormant serpent”) is sparse, pattern-taught early, paid off when ribbon slithers unrolled at end. One near-loop—“the ribbon wasn’t just an object; it was...”—survives because it crystallizes grandfather’s lesson; no clarity occlusion.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—every sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, or ritual precision. Metaphor vehicles remain internally consistent (clock heart, pendulum judge). Rhythm modulates with pendulum arc, final line exhales into quiet cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the scene—long coils for descent, staccato clicks when tweezers pick the knot. Information density is high: one sentence can locate us spatially, name the object, and hint at history (“silver worn smooth by centuries of handling, though Elias had only possessed it for seven years”). Metaphors stay consistent—tapestry as cartography, clock as mortality—without mixed-vehicle pile-ups. A single paraphrase loop (“frayed threads…threads unraveling”) costs a nip, but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; almost every sentence advances atmosphere or concept (“The quill trembled slightly, sensing the weight of its purpose”). Figurative language is sustained but patterned—ink as river, feather as kingfisher dive—so it reads as coherent texture, not purple overload. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. The only minor slip is “his ignorance now a map, his imagination a seed, his legacy a story” triplet that edges toward list, but it lands in the coda where rhythmic summation is permissible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary length and opening; no filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is selective (“dust motes in the sun”) and never muddies causality. High information density—each clause adds sensory or emotional tilt; “the broadcast’s voice lingered, a secret hum” compresses aftermath into one resonant phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is taut, rhythmic, image-dense; every sentence advances texture or stakes. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor density spike—“shattered porcelain shards, each fragment sharp enough to cut, yet delicate as butterfly wings”—but the dual image is paid off when the shard actually falls. Final paragraph breathes cleanly to single-line whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; sentences layer image and idea without scaffold (“autumn leaves pressed themselves against the tall library windows”). One paraphrase loop: “subtracting noise from both their conversations and their ancestral melodies” repeats the concept inside one line—minor. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay acoustic. Opening and closing lines are image-based, satisfying the ear. No artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between lush horticultural catalog and compressed synaptic commands, propelling without drumbeat monotony. Occasional stacked modifiers (“iridescent light that shifted…”) flirt with purple but stay purposeful to the lyric mode. No synonym loops or paraphrase stalls; each sentence adds new sensory angle or causal step. Tiny scaffold: “she reminded herself” appears twice within five lines—minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Occasional elevated diction (“gaunt frame,” “systemic failure”) fits the tower’s grandeur but nudges slightly above Elias’s probable lexicon, keeping the score just sub-8. Closure beat is clean of figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence length, no template cadence. Information density high—one sentence links shard, scent, and cosmic pressure without padding. Metaphors stay coherent: “compressed magnitude of quiet” extends auditory gold without contradiction. Only micro-slip: “drooping shutters” edges toward stock image, but offset by fresh coinages elsewhere; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from 7-word pulses to 40-word surges, propelling the revelation beat. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “phantom tide of thought” compresses invasion without mixed metaphor. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; “silent” recurs but accrues thematic weight. One near-filter stack (“He perceived their leader…”) is acceptable mid-revelation. Copy is clean; opening and closing lines frame stakes and echo.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Every sentence carries double duty: “He stopped mid-step, the groan of the stone echoing like a sigh” advances action, embodies setting, and layers metaphor without mixed vehicles. No scaffolding, loops, or synonym churn; even abstract nouns (“perpetual motion”) are tethered to physical stakes. Figurative language peaks only twice and is pattern-earned. The final clause—“the world stretched before him, not as a trap, but as a choice”—delivers a clean, propulsive cadence that recharges prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening sibilants mimic smog, later clipped phrases echo brush taps. Information density is high—“moon-tipped brush” does triple work as tool, image, metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances scene or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor—“language... spoken through sensation instead of sound”—is forgiveable in a lyric frame that privileges synesthesia. Closing line crystallizes without scaffold: “rare genuine smile” lands because prior clauses shed weight.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies from panoramic survey to staccato kneading beats; no template cadence. Sentences perform double duty: “damp, rosewater dread that clung to the limestone walls” embeds smell into setting and mood. Metaphors are coherent—waterfall sigh, bread as tombstone—without mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate. Figurative density is high but patterned (reverse motion) and paid off, avoiding overwriting penalty. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Strong verbs (“unwound,” “hoisted,” “tore open”) replace modifiers. Minor scaffold: “bleak exhilaration” is repeated verbatim; trims −0.2. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the sky-void image land. Proofing clean; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm surges and ebbs like tide; clauses carry triple duty (image, sound, motion) with almost no scaffold.  One paraphrase loop—“each obstacle found its note, each challenge its rhythm”—is forgiven because it serves as mantra, not filler, and arrives before the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no mechanical stem runs. Figurative language is sparse, pressure-driven: “sun bleached white” first line, later “sunset painted…orange and violet” both serve tonal shift rather than ornament bloat. Information-dense lines (“cross-referencing the watchers’ movements with ancient turtle shell carvings”) fold world rule + obsession in one stroke. Zero scaffolds, paraphrase loops, or mixed metaphors; copy is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences perform double duty (advance action + charge image). One paraphrase loop—“decay…rotted…decay” across adjacent clauses—costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent (ivy strangles, gilt warns). Opening and closing lines are punchy, each re-inflecting the other. No filter-verb clusters or register drift; near miss for 9.0 but loop keeps it at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty (anchor, characterize, foreshadow). Figurative language selective—metaphors (crystalline puzzle, bruised canvas) paid off by mirrored glass flare at end. Zero paraphrase loops; no template cadence. Strong verbs (“wrest,” “wedged,” “swirling”) carry motion. Minor register lift “conceptual repricing” fits surveyor’s archive mindset. Opening line arresting; final line cadence resolves with echographic click.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “reclaimed stillness” and “dappled resolve” are reused intentionally to accrue resonance, not pad. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances index evidence or emotional pressure. Figurative language is spare and apt—“light dancing through water” literalizes both the dome and the intellectual dance of new knowledge. Final clause “light eventually finds its way” lands as earned cadence, not aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm courses from long gleaming clauses to staccato chip-“click” of fracture; occasional metaphor density in the middle third (lantern/sun imagery) nudges the upper limit but never stalls propulsion; copy is clean, no loops, no mixed vehicles—only a single paraphrase echo (“luminous torment” repeated) costs a tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is high-wire: long noun-heap sentences risk density but information multiplies (sensor hum, grief shard, metaphysical premise) without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors appear once (“circuit breakers cooled their relay-sensitive hearts”) yet fit personification pattern and pass. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs drive clauses. One scaffold tic—“the… the…” anaphora near end—creates faint sermon cadence but also mirrors obsessive mindset so allowed. Closure image is crystalline, uncluttered. Proofing clean; no typos or punctuation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing participial/ nominative shapes. Information density high: one line fuses drone stall, energy barrier, and time dilation. Occasional lyrical stack (“brilliance and dimness swirled”) borders purple but pattern-taught early and pays off in final dome image, so permitted. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“heat haze with purpose”—slight ding. Grammar clean; paragraph cuts purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative language is selective, each metaphor carrying weight: “guilt had settled in him like a disease” justifies the terrace’s viral color spread. No mixed metaphors; “sieved hush” maintains acoustic filter logic throughout. Rhythm breathes with beats—long sentence for terrace sweep, fragment for gear placement. Only micro-loop: “the same color as his regrets” echoes earlier “same color as the terrace”; the tautology is purposeful, but still a blip.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet transparent; metaphor pile-ups (“mist curled…like fingers”) are limited to two per high-pressure paragraph, avoiding purple drift. No synonym loops; “mist,” “moon,” “pull” recur with functional variation rather than churn. Strong verbs (“worry,” “trace,” “squeeze”) replace modifiers. One micro-scaffold: “between apology and forgiveness existed a liminal space so thin…” repeats concept already implicit; a −0.2 nudge but it lands outside the closure beat. Otherwise, cadence breathes with scene temperature and carries momentum to the final moonlit hush.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; each image extends last (“glowed a soft blue… smooth as glass… pulsed in time”) without contradiction. Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “procedure had wiped him clean… left a void where memories once festered” compresses backstory + stakes. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“unfolded,” “waded,” “surrendered”). Final line resolves by image, not explanation. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating pressure then quiet acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense—figurative language in ~65% of sentences—yet the moon-orchard conceit is established first, so later scent-smoke spirals read as intensification, not clutter. No mixed metaphors; ember, blossom, and purr maintain coherent physics. One near-loop: “transformation…transforming” within two lines, but the second use is grammatical (verb to gerund), not synonym churn. Final image line is taut and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    High figurative density is pattern-taught early and paid off in closure image; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“impossible blossoms… choking beauty”) but it tightens rather than drags. Read-aloud rhythm varied; no scaffold artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene phases—longer sentences for floating search, clipped fragments during stitching. Information density is high; most lines advance goal or atmosphere. Two paraphrase loops (“humanity’s final wars… humanity facing its inevitable twilight”) and one mixed metaphor (“stitch open the barrier”) slightly dull the peak beat; they do not touch closure but keep the score below 8.0. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes—short beats for stumble, elongated for beach hush; no template cadence. Metaphors are consistent (bug = rogue star) and physically coherent. One paraphrase loop (“whispering hush” repeated for island and beach) and occasional “he felt” filter-stack nudge it shy of 8.5; no artifact touches the closure beat. High density, clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence variety and sensory density propel momentum; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language selective—twilight shadows, quill tracing metal—without cluttering beats. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“traced,” “loomed,” “trembled”). No artifacts in closure beat; prose remains transparent.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm modulates well; high information density in compressed phrases like “collapsed star dust levitate, drawn toward the pattern.” Occasional modifier stacks (“shimmering curtains of aurora that danced”) edge toward purple but stay within lyric contract. One paraphrase loop (“sacred patterns… patterns… patterns”) mildly dulls propulsion. No scaffolding; final line lands clean with image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic variety; sentences breathe with storm tempo. A few soft loops (“poem… map… map” restate) and stacked metaphors (“storm-kissed wonder,” “tempestuous and serene”) slightly over-season high-pressure beats. No artifact reaches closure beat; clarity intact. Minor tightening would elevate to 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught in the opening line and pays off in closure, so density penalty is waived. No mixed metaphors; “fractured compass” and “velvet-covered blade” stay within visual/tactile logic. Paraphrase loops are absent; each sentence advances image or angle. Final line “The brook murmured its agreement” is a hairline cliché, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm modulates to match quiet night work and dawn exhalation; sentence openers vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional scaffold: “beauty from anarchy” phrase recycles without fresh inflection; “luminous fracture” likewise repeats. Filter verbs minimal; imagery mostly concrete (“rusted library,” “tattoos peeking from sleeves”). One mixed metaphor: “blossoming resistance...like wildflowers through sidewalks” asks reader to merge plant/ideation metaphors, but meaning survives. Copy clean; no typos, pronoun drift, or continuity gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphor density high yet patterned (tide, film, clock) and paid off. One scaffold trace: “he had devised a method” tells ahead of showing; minor. No loops or synonym churn; sentences vary in length and syntax. Closing line lands with quiet resonance, no artifact interference.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “salt-laced air carried the scent of wet earth up from the soil that covered the small island” sets smell, scale, isolation). No synonym loops; “cerulean regret” appears only at opening and payoff, earning its repeat. Figurative density peaks in final paragraph but remains coherent. Minor hedge—“he mused”—drops score 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “shattered lilies” conveys setting, mood, and motif). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor redundancy: “slow quietude” and “slow, inevitable decay” echo slightly, but not enough to dull closure. Figurative language is coherent (butterfly = transformation, dust = agency), never muddled. Final line’s “silent prayer” resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line yield (“scent that clung to the luminous glass rods like memory”). Figurative language is purposeful, not excessive; metaphors cohere (frost as map, ash as testimony). Minor redundancy in “quiet canyon” phrasing, but no scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph propels toward closure with syntactic variation and concrete action—zero line-level artifacts dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or concept. Rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph cuts matching emotional beats. However, minor overwriting appears in peak moments: “phantom symphony of chaos,” “palette of possibilities,” and “tyranny of nothingness” verge on elevated diction that slightly distances. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“The capsize survivor had lost so much... but here... she was building something new”) edge toward paraphrase. Closure remains sharp despite these hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff (“fractured like frozen lightning against velvet”). Figurative language is controlled—no purple excess—and metaphors cohere (light as signal, seafoam as fleeting peace). Minor scaffold in “three life-threatening diving expeditions later” slightly compresses causality, but momentum holds. Final paragraph’s cadence (“chase began anew”) echoes opening tremor, creating resonant closure without redundancy. No loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “hollowed out their community,” “gently persistent,” “warmth rather than currency” do double duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minimal scaffold—no paraphrase loops or filter stacks. One slight overwriting in “wildflowers in the cracks of their harsh reality,” but closure image remains sharp. Read-aloud rhythm supports thematic hush without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line yield. Sentences vary in structure and length; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “milky substance inside seeming to pulse” edges toward abstraction, but most imagery remains concrete. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (sparks, pilgrimage, tears). Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“he knew his journey…”), but the closing image redeems it. Read-aloud rhythm is musical without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but controlled, with high information density (“bridges arced in impossible spirals, their surfaces blooming with moss and ivy, yet they pulsed faintly”). Figurative language is consistent—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm shifts with action. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“writhing,” “thick with scent of decay and possibility”) slightly slows momentum, but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “keys arranged not by pitch but by frequency” conveys both plot and character intellect economically. Figurative language is purposeful (“dust motes danced… tiny specters”) without purple excess. Minor redundancy in “chains bit deeper… metal warm from his blood” slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final paragraph’s rhythm breathes just enough to land closure without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (aurora “bleeds violet,” shipwrecks “creaked in approval”) and avoids muddle. Minor redundancy in “forge had cooled years ago, but its embers still glowed” slightly dulls momentum, but not enough to obscure closure. Rhythm varies skillfully, and the final line’s whisper blends color and sound with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: metaphors (“liquid starlight,” “emerald luminescence”) deepen atmosphere without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies effectively—long, flowing descriptions contrast with abrupt beats like “Instead, he heard silence.” Minor overwriting in peak moments (“chest ache with luminous disbelief”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every line advances mood, character, or stakes. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“plunged,” “swirled,” “wept”) and varied sentence openings. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent—icicles as “miniature clocks,” steam as “first shock of truth.” However, slight overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: three adjacent sentences use “narrated” variants, creating a template cadence. Also, “weighty lightness” recurs without evolution, verging on paraphrase loop. Closure image remains clear despite these minor artifacts; no causality obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in high-pressure beats: “stars glittering like scattered salt,” “shelves loomed like skeletons,” “whispers now a roar” create figurative density without pattern-teaching payoff. Paraphrase loops occur (“his phobia… tightening its grip” / “phobia screamed at him to flee” / “phobia a shadow”) and filter verbs stack (“he realized,” “he knew,” “he flinched”). Final paragraph suffers register drift (“trembling certainty,” “adaptive and alive”) that edges into therapy-speak, dulling the closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“star flickered like a dying candle,” “marbled hush,” “negative space that gave shape to absence”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“spaces between silences”) borders on abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final image (“booklet glowed softly… doorway into it”) resolves with resonant specificity. One near-miss with figurative density prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “metallic bristles scraping against crystalline frost” establishes character, setting, and tone in one phrase. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—staccato during sweeping, flowing during resonance—without syntactic monotony. Minor overwriting in “fractured it into a thousand tiny rainbows” risks purple prose, but payoff justifies it. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“steps steady, mind remarkably composed”) recharges opening motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “shattered reception desk” implies backstory; “concert tickets… sketching cryptic doodles” conveys method and motive in one phrase. Sentence variety supports propulsion—no template cadence. Minor overwriting in “resonant hush of the world settling into itself” risks abstraction, but it’s anchored by immediate physical detail. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final paragraph’s “quiet and full” echoes opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “weathered bark of the ancient grapevines that twisted around the lattice walls” establishes setting, character, and motif in one breath. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “mended deception at the heart of Elias's collection was his own invention” slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final line (“now truly knowing himself recognized”) resonates without sentimentality, recharging the marble motif.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“surrendered,” “pulsed,” “resolved”) and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful—“hush of beating wings at rest settling like a blanket”—but risks overwriting in peak beats (“perfect icy warmth”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “mechanically warm” borders on repetitive motif without evolving function. Final line resonates, but “scientific history might be rewritten tonight” leans slightly toward exposition over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is evocative with strong rhythm, though minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“water-laden theatre,” “wordless conversation spanning decades”). No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences summarize the program’s transformation redundantly. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “unstruck chords” verges on mixed metaphor. Final paragraph’s “inspiration and tragedy intertwine” leans abstract, but momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“auroral sorrow,” “fray the edges of reality”) without muddle. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence, and no loops or scaffolding dilute momentum. The final lines (“contours now, defined by the charcoal smudges”) land with resonant specificity—zero artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rust-stained concrete,” “frantic calls to talk-radio psychics,” and “tears frozen in time” avoid cliché. Minor overwriting in the opening simile (“scalpel” slightly strained), but figurative logic holds. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors release—long sigh after groaning stem—earning high marks despite one near-purple flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. However, adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase: e.g., “language decay and rebirth itself in cycles untouched by the frantic world above” followed by “fascinated by iron's rust turning to beauty… empires rising like flowers only to wither.” Minor scaffold appears in repetitive constructions around “regenerative silence.” No fatal loops, but slight overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., “cryptic folds in a well-worn origami swan, its paper creased into impossible geometries…”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and mostly lean, though occasional overwriting appears (“tree's dreaming roots spread like unseen rivers beneath the earth”). Figurative density peaks appropriately during totality. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“neither child nor therapist could have created it alone, but together…”) slightly dulls momentum. Final paragraph’s reflective summary (“darkness had brought illumination…”) risks telling, yet earns its place by anchoring to the locket’s physical return.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “concrete curves once meant to contain apocalypse now cradled the weight of accumulated memory” establishes setting, history, and theme in one breath. Sentence openings vary (“Aria moved,” “The dragons,” “For three years”), and rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in “emotional resonance embedded within walls like sediment in stone”—mixed metaphor (resonance/sediment)—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is controlled (“ghost in the machine,” “confetti in the wind”) and coherent. Minor scaffold in “life, transposed, hummed a new tune” leans slightly abstract, but rhythm varies naturally, paragraph lengths breathe, and closures land with imagistic precision. No loops, no redundancy—information density remains high without muddling cause or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “tapestry of rhetorical devices—metaphors of shadow, similes of decay, paradoxes of silence” leans toward cataloguing. One paraphrase-loop: “the silence returned, heavier now… the silence followed him.” These don’t obscure causality but prevent 9+; closure remains sharp despite minor textural excess.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (nautilus/spire spiral, mirrored horizon) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in “upturned hush” risks abstraction but is grounded by context. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates toward dawn then collapses with Ai’s exhaustion. Final line (“The world had his symphony, even if it would never know it”) recharges the opening motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally overwrought (“neon veins of the city,” “obscene shapes”). A few adjacent lines verge on paraphrase loops (“he had been here before… this time, something felt different” / “the darkness was brighter…”). Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure moments without pattern payoff, slightly blurring clarity during the viaduct’s collapse. Closure image remains sharp despite minor density bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but never cluttered; each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful—the “severed spear” of the needle, the “reverse architecture of sound”—and never contradictory. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in the climax (“tapestry of scrapes… frantic, buzzing text”), which borders on purple without sacrificing clarity. Rhythm varies masterfully: paragraph lengths breathe with Elara’s tension, culminating in the stark final line that echoes the opening’s hush—but transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured (“stone walls absorbed the city’s noise like a sponge,” “constellation of defiance”), risking density over clarity in mid-story. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Minor redundancy in “meticulous precision of his mind racing to intuit” weakens propulsion slightly, but the final lines recover with clean, evocative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“glass panes cast crystal shadows” establishes setting while echoing thematic fragility). Figurative language is coherent—scents take “shape and color,” memories “unravel”—without muddle. Sentence openings vary (“His name was...”, “He moved...”, “The air grew...”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “phantom shimmer of another scent layered within the primary one,” but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (rope as scripture, time as fabric) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “origami made of twilight” slightly risks coherence, but propulsion remains strong. No loops or scaffold; final line (“tapestry, impossible and beautiful in every unraveling”) recharges motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “chronic hush that settled like ash,” “vibration traveled through the bronze, soft at first, then clearer.” Figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental—each image advances atmosphere or character. Minor overwriting in “skeletal hulls of shipwrecks long claimed by the earth” slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the melody’s release—clean, resonant, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “light thickening like honey” conveys time, atmosphere, and transformation in one image. Figurative language is pattern-taught (static, amber, half-truths) and payoff-integrated, avoiding muddle. Minor scaffold in “professionally thorough as ever” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or register drift. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“extinguished the light… stepped out into the night”) resolves with resonant cadence, though “warm in their hand” borders on generic.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “grease stains on his cuffs a testament to his role behind the velvet curtains” conveys status, labor, and invisibility in one image. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (fog, tide, moths). Minor overwriting in “papers slipped from between pages like falling leaves”—a slightly stock simile—but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. No loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. High information density: “fruit-like prisms” implies both botany and optics; “wind over glass” conveys voice and setting. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“days blurred into weeks… fragile tapestry”) borders on abstraction but recovers with concrete action. No loops or scaffold; figurative language remains coherent (light as memory, reeds as threads). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “charcoal smudge,” “primal musk,” “neon rivers” do triple duty (atmosphere, character, momentum). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or deepens stakes. Figurative language is coherent (time as “fragile thread,” echoes as “ghosts” then “seeds”) and avoids purple excess. Final paragraph’s rhythm—stillness, light, release—mirrors thematic shift without muddling causality.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “tears sizzled… creating tiny wisp-like clouds” does emotional, atmospheric, and causal work. Figurative language is consistent (mathematical/emotional mapping) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “gently inventive approach” appears twice but doesn’t loop. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with ritual phases. One slight redundancy: “nourished by slow and steady drips” echoes earlier drip motif without new pressure—but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language (“beams like aged bones”) is purposeful and coherent. Minor overwriting in “boundless curiosity about the stories recorded on those fragile ribbons” slightly softens momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mar peak beats. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with scene rhythm. Closure image (“true illumination came… when the librarian held the tape fragment”) avoids purple prose while delivering thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“sky bruised purple,” “stem a taut wire”) without muddle. Syntax varies dramatically—complex clauses for observation, fragmented urgency during storm, flowing rhythms in surrender. Zero paraphrase loops; high information density (e.g., “circuitously sincere” conveys method and flaw in two words). Final lines resonate without overwriting: “dampness with a new awareness” crystallizes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “silver ribbons” conveys light, water, and guidance in three words; “canvas-stained fingers” implies history and vocation. Sentence rhythms vary effectively, accelerating toward the vortex climax. Minor overwriting in “unearthed rather than created” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Figurative language remains coherent—amber pulses, rain trails etch, waters swirl—all obeying established physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose maintains high information density: “shadows stretched... in impossible geometries” conveys spatial anomaly and thematic uncertainty in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/sound fusion) and pays off in the “cosmic grammar” climax. Minor redundancy in “steadily unpredictable” phrasing slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes stakes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ocean-spray archivist” fuses setting and role; “valve that broke when the announcement became too much” embodies thematic weight. Sentence variety supports momentum—no template cadence—but minor overwriting appears in “rain-washed ivory buildings” (redundant after “ivory harbor after rain”). One paraphrase loop: “fragments into meaning” / “compile fragments into meaning.” Closure beat remains artifact-free, with high information density (“tarnished brass... gave shape to what had been formless”).

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “arrows glowed faintly, their light pulsing like a lantern at the end of a tunnel” does triple duty). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and figurative language is mostly coherent. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “spires piercing the starlit vault like needles of judgment” mixes spatial metaphors, and “truths he’d avoided” slightly flattens the mirror-shard imagery. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines summarize (“his meticulous route mapping done... just the start”) without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally, though the phrase “unheard symphony” appears three times—functional as motif but risks slight redundancy. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Minor overwriting in “cascade of light and sound, the unheard symphony swelling into a palpable chorus”—could be tighter—but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “cursed amulet fragment, smooth and dark as a sealed promise”). Figurative language is pattern-taught: “hushed thunder” recurs to modulate tone, prisms refract both light and consciousness. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“cartographer of unseen maps”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes opening hum, creating lyrical closure without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “liquefied,” “breached”) and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful (“deathly vitality,” “footsteps echoing like a heartbeat”) without overload. One paraphrase loop: “helping without taking” / “assistance for a political refugee” slightly redundant. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; momentum sustained through kinetic beats. Final line resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept (“fingertips tracing the delicate patterns embroidered by dawn's light” establishes both setting and Silas’s attentiveness). Figurative language is coherent—light as prism, time as texture—and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy appears in “earnestly studious” and “quiet revolution” phrasing, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and the final paragraph’s cadence (“chart the hum of lamps and to refract time into gold”) delivers resonant closure without overstatement. One near-slip: “incandescent restraint” slightly strains metaphor but earns its place through context.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“The man moved…”, “He had no name…”, “One morning…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound-as-memory, container-as-monolith) and pays off in the closure. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “narrative transmutation” (borderline abstract), but no loops, scaffold, or muddled metaphors obscure causality or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences multitask (e.g., “telescopes had once reached for the stars, now sat Elias’s makeshift laboratory” conveys time, place, and thematic shift). Figurative language is precise (“ephemeral compass,” “music of questions”) without purple excess. Minor scaffold in “retelling not just the words but the unspoken doubts” slightly over-explains, but rhythm varies effectively—short staccato phrases during action, longer breaths in reflection. Final line (“direction” echoing “compass”) closes with resonant economy.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “neon lights... painting the floating maze in shifting hues of hope and decay” establishes tone economically. Figurative language serves theme (graffiti as “armor,” stone as “glyph”). Minor overwriting in “porous surface held the salt and sweat of generations” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors perpetual motion—“float through the storms”—without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“defied lunar physics,” “radiated an otherworldly glow”). However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “impossible violets and blues that defied lunar physics” leans into purple prose. Also, “dawnlit melancholy” and “dawning hush” verge on redundant lyricism. No loops or scaffolding, but figurative density slightly muddles the scientific grounding at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is restrained but potent (“fingers dancing like a musician over strings”). Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“warm glow,” “steady, confident thrum”)—slightly generic modifiers—but never obscures causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., ship’s horn interrupting focus). Final lines avoid summary, resolving through image: “hum of a machine reborn.” One near-paraphrase (“mist outside swirled… inside, only clarity”) slightly dulls momentum, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “condensation collected in ways that defied natural laws” does triple duty (atmosphere, anomaly, foreshadowing). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Minor overwriting in “turbulent beneath” (cliché) and “dry as dust” (redundant idiom), but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent—water motifs unify condensation, rivers, lake. Final line’s “stories” risks slight sentimentality but is earned by preceding restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“its dark surface drinking the last light as if it were thirsty” conveys image, mood, and object agency). Rhythm varies naturally, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and figurative language remains coherent (no mixed metaphors). Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“weaving the town's dissonant past into a harmonious present”)—slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete imagery—but doesn’t obscure causality or dull closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“materialize,” “unsnares,” “embraces”) and varied sentence openings. Figurative language is purposeful (“silence… felt like a weight”), though “crystalline spirals that capture and distort sound” slightly strains physics. One paraphrase loop: “time runs short” repeats verbatim three times—functional as motif but risks scaffold. Final paragraph avoids purple prose; closure image (“message… waiting for the next explorer”) lands cleanly. No filter-verb stacks or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies skillfully, and paragraph cuts heighten tension. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“becoming nothing more than story and air”)—a slight figurative excess—but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final third maintains propulsion without artifact. Information density is high, though one or two adjectives (“melancholic,” “bruised”) verge on expected.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “bride of mist and sorrow” conveys form, emotion, and motif). Figurative language is consistent—bioluminescence, frost, ash—and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“sorrow of her loss tempered by the joy…”) slightly slows momentum, but peak beats (“lifetimes collapsed into a single, searing instant”) are sharp. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold, though one near-redundancy (“mournful elation” echoed twice) nudges score down.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield (“loom stood like skeletons,” “paths… illuminating the pattern of transformation”). Figurative language is controlled: metaphors cohere (loom/skeleton, canyon/wound, orchids/heartbeat). Minor overwriting in “residual magic of the labyrinth’s creators” slightly strains credibility, but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports emotional arc without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots snaking like veins through skeletal remains” merges setting and theme economically. Figurative language is coherent (orchard as body, history as soil) without purple excess. Minor scaffold in “purposeful yet wandering” slightly flattens momentum, but final paragraph’s cadence (“not behind her, but had just begun”) resolves with rhythmic precision. Zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“vaporized memories,” “temporal convergence”). Minor paraphrase loops exist—e.g., repeated emphasis on “juxtapose” and “margins”—but don’t obscure clarity. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One scaffold phrase: “careful invention had been his hallmark since childhood” slightly summarizes rather than dramatizes. Closure beat remains sharp despite slight figurative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “unraveling conspiracies” appears three times with minimal variation; “echoed silence” recurs as near-paraphrase loop; “adjacent possibilities” is repeated without functional evolution. High figurative density in climactic beats risks muddling causality (“needle darting between threads of fate” blurs metaphor and action). Still, rhythm varies purposefully, and key images land with precision—especially the final shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line payoff. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“skeletal fingers,” “fierce tenderness”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“unsent letters began to cascade…”) edges toward purple prose but doesn’t obscure clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s “just stone again” risks slight abstraction but is anchored by tactile history.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—most lines multitask (e.g., “fronds glistening with twilight’s tears” merges setting, tone, and emotion). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“lotus-hearted ache,” “reef-turned-battlefield”) risks figurative saturation, but pattern is voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic resolution—cadence breathes as pain transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“skeletal trees fleshed out,” “laughter echoing… in the depths of her soul”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as developer, memory as emulsion) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent descriptors (“vibrant and pure”), but no paraphrase loops, template cadence, or scaffold clutter. Sentence propulsion aligns with scene needs—accelerating during resurrection, slowing at closure—and the final line (“if only one knows how to paint with it”) perfectly recharges the core motif.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “a dance of precision and whimsy that brought ghosts of color back to life” establishes character, method, and theme in one stroke. Figurative language is coherent—water, music, and light motifs interweave without contradiction. Minor overwriting appears (“thrumbing that bewitched her senses”), but no loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the chapel’s hum, closing the sonic motif with earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “moth wings fluttering like coded syllables” merges image, theme, and setting. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—longer cadences for greenhouse ambiance, staccato for raid urgency. One minor flaw: “candidly cryptic” slightly strains as a descriptor, bordering on label-speak, but is redeemed by the gourd seed’s tactile handling. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line propels character or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly disciplined: metaphors cohere (galaxy/postcard/blossom/light), and rhythm varies effectively. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“photosynthesize pain into beauty” used twice; “shyly unstoppable” repeated). The phrase “reef-shadow joy” borders on coined abstraction, slightly dulling immediacy. No fatal loops, but figurative density occasionally edges toward purple—e.g., “ghosts of long-dead tides”—without payoff, costing a half-point.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“foxglove regret curled… poison-sweet” conveys emotion and motif). Sentence rhythm varies skillfully, and metaphors cohere within the story’s logic (sound as tangible force, memory as thread). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“unraveling like a threadbare tapestry” slightly strains), but no loops or scaffold dull momentum. Closure image remains sharp despite lush texture.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “liquid starlight,” “constellation of hope,” and repeated “symphonies of truth” verge on purple in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“paths had diverged… paths converge”; “silence was broken… silence was no longer a void”). However, rhythm generally serves momentum—sentences accelerate with her writing—and closure image (“shards caught the light”) remains clear. Figurative coherence holds; metaphors align with musical/textual motifs without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “dappled resolve of sunlight” conveys light, mood, and thematic weight). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“geological—it had been a conversation”) slightly dilutes clarity, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence variety supports rhythm; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Figurative coherence remains strong despite rich imagery (“dust like forgotten confetti”).

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes (“The mars meteorite chip felt impossibly old…” ties object, emotion, and backstory). Figurative language is pattern-taught (dust as wildfire flowers, stars) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “silent symphony” and “desperate, beautiful act” slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence—“blooming, withering in the solitary shaft of light”—perfectly echoes opening, earning its lyricism through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“grain flowed outward like water disturbed by stones”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match scene needs. However, adjacent lines occasionally restate concepts (“thresholds had begun calling… why some doorways felt sacred”), creating mild paraphrase loops. Figurative language is coherent (butterfly wings → reality fracture → wood grain), though “featherly determined” appears three times with diminishing returns. No artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “carbonized veins still visible beneath the char” does triple duty (image, texture, mystery). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shadowseam wonder,” “luminous respite”) borders on label-speak but is redeemed by context. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One paraphrase loop (“patterns identical to constellations above” / “echoed constellations”) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere (“red bloomed like blood—fear”). Figurative language is purposeful (seeds as “tiny stars,” light as “nervous fireflies”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “cheerful gloom” repetition (three mentions), but it serves thematic resonance. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; closure beat (“missing pieces that somehow told a more complete story”) is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“eyes like shattered glass,” “shadow stretched like a phantom limb”) and varied syntax. Nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting in two adjacent metaphors (“wild thing tamed by design” / “waiting masterpiece”) slightly dilutes closure beat. No loops or scaffolding; information density is high. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, though one or two elevated phrases (“theater of calculated wilderness”) flirt with register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“veins of light,” “obsidian grace”) is coherent and recurring, not muddled. Minor overwriting in the climax (“burned with obsidian grace—sharp, elegant, absolute…”) edges toward purple but serves tone. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Final line’s propulsion (“rewrite the world not through what it said, but through the gaps it created”) perfectly echoes the core method.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought—“prism atrium in mist” repeats four times, verging on scaffold. Figurative density is high yet mostly coherent, though “noctilucent reckonings” borders on jargon. Minor loop: “Before everything shifts” recurs without deepening. Final paragraph tightens well, but earlier redundancy costs momentum. No fatal artifacts, yet proximity to purple prose prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ink spilled across parchment” immediately establishes tone and visual motif. Sentence variety supports rhythm—fragments for emphasis, flowing clauses for memory. Minor overwriting in “constellation of burn scars that mapped his skin like topographic lines of trauma” risks mixed metaphor (astral + cartographic), but it’s character-consistent. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure image (“path barely visible in the darkness”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“tide-polished grotto,” “lucent shells,” “soft blue light”) and high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence structure varies purposefully, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“serene upheaval” repeated), but metaphors remain coherent (balloonist’s gauge as hope-meter). No loops or scaffold; the final paragraph’s propulsion (“heart light as a balloon…”) earns its lyricism without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“leaves that clung… like stubborn secrets,” “negative coiled like a snake”) and varied syntax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Slight overwriting in “the corridors held the ghosts of those who’d listened too closely”—metaphor verges on explanatory. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully resolves motif and theme, though “burned in his pocket” slightly contradicts earlier “gloved hands trembling” handling (minor continuity slip).

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: “dew still held the night’s secrets,” “shadows walked their own paths” do double duty in atmosphere and theme. Minor overwriting in “perceptively calm purpose” (slightly redundant), but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm—complex during creation, staccato at bells’ chime. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors dissolution and return.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with high information density—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though a few adjacent lines paraphrase (“ledger of failures,” “testament to flawed beauty”). Figurative language is consistent (celestial dance, weight of past) but slightly dense in the opening paragraph. No loops or scaffold; closure image is clear. One near-redundancy (“slow dance” appears three times) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density (“manufactured drought… transforming wetland into otherworldly mirror”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in “fractured beauty of this moment was almost too much” edges toward abstraction, but peak beats remain concrete. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s “arrhythmic patterns that almost resembled applause” earns its lyricism through setup.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—threads “pulsed like a living thing,” prisms “relieved”—but occasionally overwrites: “alarming serenity,” “lullaby of conformity,” and “space between sigh and smile” verge on abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, yet some metaphors repeat conceptually (light/echo/thread motifs). Sentence variety supports momentum, though the final paragraph’s cascade of affirmations (“She was... She had... The night was...”) risks rhythmic saturation. Still, information density remains high, and closure image (“world answered”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical (“darkness descended like a velvet curtain,” “meteor hush”) but occasionally over-ornamented—e.g., “half-lit, incomplete yet illuminating” risks abstraction. Sentence variety supports momentum, though a few adjacent lines verge on paraphrase (“stories don’t end—they transform” / “reverse creation is... evolution”). No fatal loops or scaffold; closure image remains sharp. Minor figurative density in mid-text slightly dulls propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“interrupted cadence,” “blushing stillness”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent descriptions of stillness, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final paragraph avoids purple prose, landing with restrained power: “a knot tied in the loose thread of time” crystallizes the motif without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “snowmelt ardor” fuses scent and emotion; “light bloomed… projecting the card’s pattern” merges action and image. Figurative language is coherent (rope as serpent, voices as droplets) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in “waves of jade and violet” slightly dilutes urgency, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line—“hands empty, but full”—resolves with resonant concision.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “a dance of foresight made manifest,” “gritting with corrupted data.” Sentences vary rhythmically; paragraphs cut meaningfully. One minor flaw: “conceptual, a cancer of purpose” slightly strains metaphor coherence. No loops or scaffold; every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Final image (“only one who could walk it”) recharges the vine-break opening with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “crumbling bricks humming with a dusky harmony that was part decay, part waiting” does triple duty. Figurative language is coherent (light “bled,” stars “pricked,” world “tilted”). Minor redundancy in “encrypted devotion” phrasing, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors cosmic calm—short clauses (“He left... disappeared...”) after the tile’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is evocative but occasionally overwrites: “reality shifted around him like waves in a pond” borders on mixed metaphor when paired with “walls flickered between stone and mist.” Minor paraphrase loops exist (“broken cylinder pin” repeated verbatim). However, rhythm varies naturally, sentences advance multiple aims, and the final paragraph’s cadence recharges the opening. No scaffold or template cadence; figurative language is mostly coherent. One slip: “releasedresentment” typo slightly mars closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fog swirled like pale ghosts, erasing boundaries between earth and sky, between what was real and what might exist only in memory”). Figurative language is coherent—glass, light, and fog motifs interlock without muddle. Minor overwriting in “quantum alchemy” risks abstraction but is immediately grounded by tactile action. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm accelerates precisely at the ritual’s peak.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sunlight filtering through stained glass in dappled rivers” advances atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is coherent (orchard as “leafy sea,” vows as deciduous). Minor overwriting in “whispers of forgotten prayers brushing against her cheeks” slightly softens immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“understand”) resonates without redundancy, and sentence openings vary naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “crystalline fruits containing stolen moments” conveys concept, image, and stakes in one phrase. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm (short staccato beats for transitions, longer flows for epiphanies). Minor overwriting in “simply complicated” repetitions (−0.3), but no loops or scaffold dull closure. Figurative language remains coherent—orchard as repository, cameo as key—without mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “pages a mosaic of pressed, silent leaves that smelled of forgotten seasons” establishes voice, setting, and theme in one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (silence as symphony, gaps as pressure points) and pays off at closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the rescue moment—Kael’s return feels slightly swift—but rhythm remains controlled, and the final line (“quiet hum… imprinted on their Hearts”) earns its capitalization through accumulated resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “laughter echoed without bodies”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting occurs in peak beats: “blissfully aberrant nature of their existence finally making sense” verges on explanatory, and “unkindled solace” repeats without deepening. No fatal artifacts, but slight figurative stacking dulls the climax’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “scent that usually grounded him, but now it mingled with the faint, unplaceable perfume of fables of absence” layers sensory detail with thematic weight. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“The door shouldn’t exist…”, “Elias, an adaptable archivist…”, “On the nearest table…”). Minor overwriting in “void stitched from threads of starlight and shadow”—mixed textile/cosmic metaphor—but payoff justifies it. Closure beat (“chimed… heard the notes as words”) avoids artifacts, landing with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled (“storm of light and sound,” “blueprints of silence”) and coherent within the established physics of resonance. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “temple of silence” and “world gone mad,” slightly diluting precision. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies naturally. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fractured rainbows that danced,” “cloak woven from starlight and silence.” Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shard of hush” repeated closely) nudges toward purple prose but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety sustains momentum; paragraph cuts align with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop (“patterns still matter, connections still exist”) slightly dulls the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“lightning flickered like a dying star” borders on mixed metaphor with earlier “never struck” motif). Minor paraphrase loop: “preemptively nostalgic” repeats three times without deepening. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports cadence shifts. However, “sculpted identity from experience” near end echoes prompt language, slightly dulling closure’s originality.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “combustion would smell sweet when it met these blooming walls” merges sensory layers economically. Figurative language is purposeful (twilight’s “strokes,” hopelessness’ “gravity”) without purple overload. Sentence openings vary (“As the day surrendered…”, “From the satchel…”, “The chant was not…”), and paragraph cuts serve momentum. Minor flaw: “resonating against stone and petal in equal measure” slightly abstracts, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift dull closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies effectively: long, flowing sentences mimic tides; short phrases (“Something shifted”) punctuate turns. Minor overwriting in “microscopic ridges that generations of sea salt had carved” slightly slows momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Figurative coherence is strong—cicada, tide, stars form an integrated metaphor system without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting (“intangibly tangible,” “gilded hush”) edges toward abstraction. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor redundancy in describing the doll’s warmth/cool cycle, but no scaffold loops or register drift. Final lines land cleanly, though “symphony of silences” risks slight cliché—still, propulsion remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density (e.g., “rails humming beneath like a sigh” conveys sound, motion, and mood). However, repetitive phrasing in the final third (“The vial was still,” “The silence was kind”) creates paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Figurative language remains coherent (storm glass as emotional barometer), but the closing cadence leans on template-like repetition, preventing 9+ despite strong opening propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with strong verbs and selective sensory detail (“dizzying prism,” “synth-skin coating”). Occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats (“fingers working frantically,” “breathless into a sanctuary”) leans toward abstraction. Minor paraphrase near climax (“plunged through the liquid veil, emerging breathless”) borders on redundancy. No syntactic monotony or register drift, but figurative density slightly blurs immediacy during mural revelation. Closure image remains clear despite minor padding.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and stakes simultaneously (“burned bridges… with the quiet precision of a surgeon”). Minor overwriting in “loaded emptiness” (abstract) slightly dulls an otherwise concrete lexicon. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language is coherent (sanctuary as orchid, connections as amputation) and pattern-taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“beam cutting through... forest of glowing caps”), varied syntax, and strong verbs (“palmed,” “crackled,” “crystallize”). One paraphrase loop: “pressure of his past” / “metaphorical pressure” / “pressure Lee carried” slightly blurs momentum. Figurative language is rich but coherent—no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph risks slight overwriting (“quiet resolve,” “living reminder”), but closure image remains sharp. No scaffold or register drift; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“shadows danced like old memories,” “waves cresting like a tide”) without muddle. Minor overwriting appears in “eloquently silent” and “bridge of intuition”—slightly abstract—but quickly grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Final line earns its lyricism through accumulated resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“time stretching like taffy, then snapping back”), but rhythm varies effectively. Key flaw: “unsnap” is grammatically jarring—should be “unsnapped” or “unscrewed”—and appears at the pivotal action, dulling immediacy. Otherwise, high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. No loops or scaffold, though one mixed metaphor (“roots intertwined like old secrets” + “murmured allegiance scrawled”) slightly muddles coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is precise and evocative, with high information density—e.g., “dust patterns wrote their own stories” conveys both setting and theme.

    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances character, theme, or pressure. Figurative language (“shavings collecting like snow,” “mechanical breath”) is consistent and purposeful. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies to mirror tension (short declarations during inspection, lyrical flow in solitude). Final line’s “dangerously authentic blooming” perfectly recharges prior motifs without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and musical, but occasionally over-ornamented (“cosmic cello,” “cobalt atrium that dwarfed the landscape”) without advancing causality. Minor paraphrase-loop: “dissolving boundaries” and “become the boundary itself” echo closely. Final paragraph’s “trembling certainty… grew stronger” slightly dilutes the earlier sharper “tremor.” Still, rhythm varies effectively, and every sentence serves atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“pulled a glowing glob,” “fractured light”) and purposeful figurative language. Sentence openings shift naturally; paragraph lengths mirror emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in “kaleidoscope of hues Leo could only perceive as shades of gray”—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but controlled—high information density with minimal redundancy. Figurative language is consistent (light/sound metaphors never contradict), though near the climax, phrases like “cascade of harmonics” and “frequency so soft it could only be felt” flirt with abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One slight overwriting moment (“powerfully gentle expression, as if their very being were calibrated to soothe”) edges toward label-speak but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brass dome reflected Elian's weathered face” establishes voice, setting, and interiority in one stroke. Figurative language is pattern-taught (curtains, blooming, weaving) and pays off in closure. Minor redundancy in “timeless space outside of normal chronology” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create rhythm—long for reflection, short for revelation. Final line (“grief had been repurposed into purpose”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“rain beaded against the skylight,” “metallic ruler of destiny”) and varied syntax. High information density: each sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Minor overwriting in “multiplying paths” explanation leans toward abstraction, and one paraphrase loop exists (“cultural rituals of faith, loss, and rebirth” echoed later). No scaffold or register drift; closure beat remains clear and propelled.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror the ritual’s cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “atoms of nostalgia” is repeated four times with minimal variation, and phrases like “steadily unpredictable” verge on label-speak without deeper embodiment. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines summarize the purification method redundantly (“avoiding patterns — a steadily unpredictable dance…”). These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“shadows slipped away like secrets,” “leaves turning inward to create sanctuaries”) and avoids loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs shift visually to mirror library transformation. Minor overwriting in “luminous regret filled her chest” slightly abstracts emotion, but immediacy returns in tactile actions (tracing the stone, placing it in the chamber). No artifacts obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-ornamented (“quiet vividness,” “shimmering stillness”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density high (e.g., “emerald to gold to dusk” conveys both color shift and emotional arc). Minor register drift in “fragile convictions” risks abstraction but is grounded immediately by tactile action. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, though “blend of truth and hope” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “concentric coffee rings… map to someone's pain” does triple duty (image, character, theme). Minor overwriting in “displaced miracle born from modern medicine's kiss”—slightly ornate for Maya’s lexicon—but redeemed by context. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Final paragraph’s “unfinished coffee” callback exemplifies high information density. One mixed metaphor (“meteor hush”) slightly muddles sensory logic but enhances tone.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“silver serpent,” “hushed thunder”) is coherent and payoff-driven. Minor overwriting in “ghostly echo of a melody, a tune for which forgotten lyrics searched endlessly” slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully resolves the central metaphor without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or action. Figurative language is pattern-taught (stardust as memory-weaver) and paid off (coating hands at end). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“kaleidoscopic hues dancing,” “golden tear in the night”) borders on purple but serves tone without muddling clarity. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Final line (“one last whisper… urging her onward”) perfectly recharges the opening aurora image with forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“luminescent crystals bloomed like ghost flowers” establishes setting and metaphor simultaneously). Figurative language is coherent—quantum foam, frozen glass cities—and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in one beat (“packaged in silver spheres”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure remains sharp. Sentence variety supports cadence shifts, especially in the lullaby-like final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density (“brass vines wrapped around copper trunks, each leaf trembling with the precision of clockwork”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Minor overwriting appears in “resonant frequency the mechanical trees only revealed to those who listened with the awakened sense”—slightly redundant after earlier establishment. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language remains coherent. Final beat (“teeth rearranged to match… neural network”) lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled—high information density, varied sentence openings, strong verbs (“unfurls,” “lapped,” “crystallize”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “foam on waves—ever forming, ever reforming” edges toward redundancy. No scaffold loops or register drift; figurative language coheres within the mythic register. Final paragraph’s “gently persistent as tides” slightly echoes earlier phrasing but serves closure resonance, not loop.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary (“The silent-choir bellhop stood…”, “Today, however…”, “He would remain.”), rhythms breathe with scene needs. One minor flaw: “seraphically mundane” borders on elevated diction that slightly jars with the bellhop’s pragmatic role, though it’s thematically justified. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; the final image (“cobalt walls seemed lighter”) crystallizes the entire arc without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “inky blooming like a miniature nebula,” “sound like fine silk tearing.” Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (ink = cosmic force). Minor overwriting in “graceful collapse” repetition slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—elegant, restrained, inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or motif. Figurative language is controlled (“creaked like a dying whale,” “colors bleeding into the water like ghosts”) and coheres within a marine-decay lexicon. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“periodically eternal, its cycles…”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors tidal ebb—propulsive yet calming.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“toes gripping concrete as if it were a celestial body” fuses setting, character, and metaphor). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“solemn theater of废弃ed dreams”—note typo) slightly muddles flow, but closure beat is pristine. No paraphrase loops; rhythm accelerates into the hum then softens organically. Figurative coherence remains intact—stone song, brass chime, stellar dust all harmonize tonally.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “steam rising from the geothermal vents that dotted the valley—remnants of a war” merges setting, history, and atmosphere in one clause. Figurative language is controlled; metaphors cohere (amber as egg, traditions as roots). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Slight overwriting in “wave of potential that washed over the valley”—“washed” slightly muddles the tactile precision—but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “wind-swept junipers that clung to the edge of the precipice” does setting, character, and theme in one phrase. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines (“physical memories that surged without warning, transporting her back...”)—a slight paraphrase loop. Otherwise, syntax varies purposefully, and metaphors stay coherent (roots = trauma, salt = memory). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors “pearl of stillness” with earned lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“splintered wood scattered across the floor like fractured memories”), but the pattern is taught early and pays off in closure. Minor redundancy appears in adjacent lines (“each card, each shelf, each splinter of wood was a thread, interconnected yet isolated”), triggering a −0.3 loop penalty. Otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully, and every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“his steps measured but unhurried” reveals discipline; “ink shimmering like oil on water” foreshadows transience). Figurative language is coherent—wind sculpts stone and fate; anger is “the calm eye of a storm.” Minor overwriting in mid-section (“fleeting as they were intricate… fleeting as it was”) risks synonym loop but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence variety supports rhythm; paragraph cuts heighten focus. Final line (“The story of time was written in vanishing ink, and he had finally learned how to read it”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from dense figurative repetition (“ghost,” “spark,” “pulse,” “tomb”) without pattern payoff, creating purple overwriting. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“She had scandalized them, yes, but she had also freed them” / “The dangerous liaison letter had torn the veil…”). Final paragraphs loop through near-identical thematic declarations, dulling momentum and closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “velvet around her father's knife” conveys memory, rejection, care). Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “engraved quiet of her sanctuary”—“engraved quiet” risks abstraction despite contextual grounding. No loops or scaffold; rhythm supports theme. One near-paraphrase: “weave continuity through chaos” and “create beauty where destruction had reigned” slightly echo, but not enough to stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“flowers of humming air,” “sleepwalking constellations”) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in “dissonant beauty of this place” slightly dilutes propulsion, and “profound and cosmic sorrow” edges toward abstraction—but immediately countered by concrete action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: sentences often multitask (e.g., “Its point was bent, a tiny imperfection that felt like a key” links object, emotion, plot). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors or purple prose. Minor scaffold in “She would prove it was murder...” slightly tells rather than shows, but momentum recovers swiftly. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors resolve: short clauses building to “The only thing left was to print it.”

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “fingers steady as the northern star” conveys skill, setting, and emotional control in one image. Rhythm varies purposefully—long sentences for atmosphere (“air hung heavy with ghosts…”), short staccato phrases for crisis (“When Orion touched the device…”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or texture. Figurative coherence is masterful: sound-as-substance metaphor (“whiskey burning through wires”) persists without contradiction, and the final “quietest cry… constellation” payoff feels inevitable, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“lilac unease” → “tasted of lilac and courage”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“violet to lavender to deep indigo—each hue infused with the lilac unease”), slightly blurring propulsion. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase (“emergent hush… absorb even the whispers” / “muted by the emergent hush”) costs precision.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, setting, or theme (“jagged edges bit into her skin” embodies both pain and presence). Minor overwriting in “ghosts of the fire rising not as wraiths of terror, but as witnesses” slightly muddles metaphor, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. Final line (“The world listened”) resonates without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fractured timeline worn thin by ghostly repetition” compresses backstory while advancing atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (synesthetic taste → musical fruit → temporal ripples) and pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Arthur floated…”, “He drifted…”, “Miles away…”). Final line’s “haunted not by despair but by possibility itself” recharges “encore-seeking” with earned resonance—no scaffold or purple prose obscures cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or method. Rhythm varies effectively—lyrical during setup, propulsive during dance. Minor overwriting in “fractally precise rainbows skittering” and “willowglass hope,” which verge on ornamental abstraction. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (light = emotion, geode = mind). Final paragraph tightens momentum without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; figurative language serves texture (“ghosts of tides,” “opalescent glow”) without muddling causality. Minor overwriting in “factually mystical, a paradox that defied her logical understanding”—slightly redundant. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “the caves weren’t silent; they were waiting” echoes earlier silence motif without new pressure, but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“buttons polished like river stones,” “sand a relentless descent”), and sentences vary rhythmically. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though two adjacent lines repeat “as the truth unraveled” near start and end—a minor redundancy. Figurative language is coherent (echo hums, sand defies gravity) and pattern-taught. One slight overwriting: “unearthed silence, as if the very air held its breath” risks personification cliché, but it’s brief and tonally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “Unfurling it felt like cracking a bone” merges sound, texture, and emotional weight. Minor overwriting in “study in silver hush” risks abstraction but is grounded immediately by tactile details. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors thematic closure—rhythm slows as mist swallows him, echoing the erasure of his code.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“spindrift serenity,” “palimpsest promise”) borders on ornamental, but these terms are earned by context and payoff. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (stitching, percolation, fog as veil). Final lines achieve propulsion without clutter. One near-redundancy: “fragments of their lives until they made sense again” slightly paraphrases “distill complexity into essence,” but not enough to trigger loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose achieves high information density: “hands knew the sharp gentleness of turning clay” establishes character, theme, and tone in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent—light fractures like heat haze, smoke as “silent grey river”—without mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “dissonant hum from fractured timelines he sensed” slightly muddles causality, but peak beats remain clear. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., single-line “He had come to understand” after dense description).

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence matching nocturnal labor.

Closure image remains sharp, unblurred by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery, though occasionally over-ornamented (“atomically reflective fingers,” “crystalline shell around her heart”) risks tipping into abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“The library's tidal nature reflected her own emotional rhythms, sometimes drowning in sorrow, sometimes flowing with acceptance…”) verge on restatement. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with thematic cadence, and the final line delivers resonant propulsion. Minor figurative density in peak beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff. Figurative language is pattern-taught (spirals, prisms, threads) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in “colossal, metallic God’s-wort” slightly strains metaphor logic, but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every image advances atmosphere, character, or theme—zero scaffold or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph cuts align with beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“cosmic tricksters,” “celestial silence”). Final line resonates without overstatement. One near-miss: “structured signals that defied conventional explanation” borders on generic, but specificity quickly returns. Otherwise, line-level craft is publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“shadows elongating into impossible angularities while starlight fractured into prismatic shards”) and strong verbs (“transfix,” “reverberation”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—three adjacent metaphors in the climax (“hungry maws,” “captured auroras,” “defiant cry against entropy”) risk density overload.

Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly modulates resignation and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “oxidized green hue matching the perpetual twilight” merges setting and mood efficiently. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, “spongey dread” appears three times with diminishing returns—a faint loop that borders on scaffold. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “geometric patterns” on the horizon lacks tactile specificity. No fatal artifacts, but minor redundancy prevents 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs and concrete nouns. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “luminous disbelief” and “pixelated amnesty,” which verge on coined abstraction. One paraphrase loop: “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” repeats conceptually in the ending. No syntactic monotony, but the phrase “bridge-song” recurs mechanically without evolving function, slightly dulling its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “iron elephants and carved horses stood petrified beneath decades of rust” does triple duty (setting, mood, character). Minor overwriting appears in “colorful paper tapestry of journeys that always ended where they began”—a slight abstraction amid otherwise concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong information density: “brass fittings gleaming in the moonlight,” “shoulders stooped with a burden she couldn't yet identify.” Minor overwriting in “startling clarity” and “strange healing properties” edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “variable stars” repetition borders on motif-forcing. Final paragraph’s lyricism lands cleanly, though “midnight solace” appears twice, slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Strong verbs (“churned,” “unbend,” “lapped”) and specific nouns (“flesh-eating plant seed”) avoid fluff. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “swirling orchard vortex” repeats with slight variation; justified as motif. Final beat avoids artifacts, maintaining clarity even in lyric mode. Deducted slightly for one near-purple flourish (“warlike serenity”) that risks opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“its spiraling form felt like a map, but to a place that had already arrived”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (scars, blue, static) and pays off at closure without muddle. Minor overwriting in “bioluminescent light and song” slightly dilutes specificity, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift impair clarity. Final line’s “learn to wait” resonates without sentimentality, closing the anxious elation motif with earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“glow,” “roots,” “bones”) and pays off in the fruit.

Minor scaffold appears in the phrase “confidently uncertain” (slightly abstract), but it’s grounded immediately by context. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with emotional beats, and the final paragraph’s cadence (“listen to the silence, and finally understand its song”) resonates without purple excess. No loops, synonym churn, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong verbs (“pulsing,” “whipping,” “germinated”) and varied syntax. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “philosophy rendered in equations,” “entire constellations of information” verge on purple. One paraphrase loop: “haunted ambitions had become her inheritance” / “haunted ambitions had begun” slightly redundantly echoes “haunted.” These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+; otherwise, line-level craft is precise and momentum-sustaining.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (light as memory, identity as turning pages) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in “wintersun serenity” (slightly redundant) and one paraphrase loop (“contradictions were not merely tolerated but embraced” / “wisdom thrived in the spaces between opposites”). Otherwise, syntactic variety, strong verbs (“crept,” “meld,” “distilled”), and rhythmic control sustain momentum. Final line resonates without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and high information density (“flesh meeting flesh as if discovering touch for the first time”).

Closure beat remains clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information per line (e.g., “tape-wrapped folds a promise of repair”). Figurative language is controlled—ivy as “grasping hands” is the sole borderline mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Deduction for slight overwriting in two beats: “daringly methodical” repeats verbatim three times, creating a minor template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is consistent (temporal waves, breathing books) without muddle. Minor scaffold appears in “documented carefully… documented frantically”—a slight paraphrase loop—but it’s brief and pressure-driven. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the scene, and the final line (“ready to guide her back”) recharges the watch motif cleanly. No register drift or purple excess; even elevated phrases (“ethereal splendor,” “liminal space”) feel earned by the dreamer’s perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: “velvet observatory,” “molecular hum,” “propagate life wherever her thoughts touched” serve atmosphere and theme. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“deep indigo,” “slow dance,” “crystalline structure”) edges toward density without immediate payoff. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor: “perforated destiny” (textural) clashes slightly with “holes in what was meant to be” (spatial). Final lines are clean, resonant, and propel closure without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “memory-infused serenity,” “cold electromagnetic sea of his cellular memory.” Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs.

Final paragraph’s rhythm—building from grip to gaze to preparation—creates perfect cadence shift toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “smooth and ancient against the freezing metal” conveys object history and setting in seven words. Figurative language is precise (“luminance... clinging like honey”) without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line: “key tag burned against his thigh” conveys object, emotion, and secret in one image. Minor overwriting in the underwater sequence (“soundless symphony that only he could perceive”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (lanterns as vows, sound as color). Final paragraph’s “amber and rose” gulls earn their lyricism through prior sensory groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances theme, character, or atmosphere (“photons dwindled into the contracted universe’s singularity”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (backward prophecies, static bursts) and payoff-earned. Minor scaffold in “quietly enthusiastic” repetition (lines 1 and 16), but no loops or muddle in peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence varies purposefully, avoiding monotony while crystallizing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: sentences vary in length and structure to mirror emotional shifts (short staccato during naming, flowing during resolution). Figurative language is purposeful—“frozen flames,” “whispered voices clinging like mist”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “crystalline sea monsters, their forms eternal” slightly dilutes momentum, but closure remains sharp. Zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “crystalline arches refracting the first light into a thousand fractured rainbows” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is coherent (water as “forgotten song,” magic as “embers in ash”) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “his devotion to the world’s balance was brittle—easily shaken, yet stubbornly held together…” slightly over-explains, but immediate physical grounding limits harm. Sentence variety supports rhythm; no loops or artifacts dull closure. Final line (“slowly, impossibly, healing”) recharges “plausible impossibility” with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“bruised moon,” “stars fallen to earth”) and coherent. Minor overwriting in “anise and regret” borders on abstraction but is redeemed by immediate embodiment (“burning a precise, humane line”). No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line crystallizes the motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “kaleidoscopic waterfall shattered light into a million dancing prisms” advances atmosphere, theme, and setting simultaneously. Minimal loops; figurative language is coherent (light/shatter/prisms motif sustained). One slight overwriting in “pure, unadulterated understanding” (abstract), but immediately grounded by tactile vibration. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “silence so profound it felt like its own heartbeat” fuses atmosphere and interiority. Figurative language is pattern-taught (soundless echoes, static as sea) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “fireflies in the dark” metaphor, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“threads they’d woven”) recharges motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “history rewriting itself faster now, timelines colliding like waves” advances atmosphere, conflict, and setting. Figurative language is pattern-taught (void, ice, sea) and payoff-earned (brain’s glow dissolving clone). Minor overwriting in “searing reality of his own existence” borders on therapy-speak but is offset by concrete immediacy elsewhere. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or mystery. Figurative language is restrained but potent (“mythic weight settled over the room like a shroud”). Minor redundancy appears in “faint, almost imperceptible warmth” and “subtle, internal current,” but these don’t obscure causality. The final paragraph’s cadence breathes with earned quietude, avoiding purple excess. No loops, no scaffold—just controlled, evocative compression fitting a 700-word lyric-accumulative form.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “a wound in the earth,” “mac erate the memory,” “crystalline tinkling against the symphony’s bass note.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound as physical substance) and pays off in the diamond-mote climax. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“guttural growl that should have felt violent but felt…”) slightly dulls momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its hush.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density without clutter: “crystalline flowers held the memory of a warmth they’d never felt” conveys setting, theme, and character in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (light boundaries, vortex of belief) and purposeful, never muddling clarity. Sentence openings vary (“Sylvan waited…” / “Through the veil…” / “He did not touch it…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-text, but no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with figurative language purposefully deployed (e.g., “frozen bloom amidst the ashes”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in “molecule by molecule while simultaneously building it anew,” where simultaneity slightly muddles causality. Otherwise, sentence variety and concrete diction sustain momentum without artifact interference near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density: “steel bones vibrate,” “liquid silver” signal. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“serenely electric” appears twice, slightly redundant. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences vary in structure and opening. Final paragraph’s cadence (“always listening, always tuning”) risks slight template echo but pays off the motif. Closure image remains sharp despite one ornamental modifier.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “prismatic patterns,” “sideways-running clocks,” “multiversal ocean” all advance atmosphere and concept. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in the climax (“physics realigned itself…”) borders on abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; every line propels story, character, or mood. Final line resonates by reprising Elijah’s tagline with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere (“walls curved inward without bending”), character (“jaw tightened”), or stakes (“texture of connection”). Figurative language is coherent—sinew thread “shimmering like spun moonlight” aligns with “realistically imaginary” logic—and avoids muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting in the climax (“heap of fractured light and sound”) slightly dilutes clarity, but rhythm varies purposefully (short punches amid lyrical flows). No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Syntax varies purposefully—e.g., the cascade of stellar light “mimicking the sky most of these students had never personally witnessed” uses subordinate clauses to embed pathos. Minor flaw: “balancedly curious” slightly jars as adverbial overreach, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or purple prose; metaphors cohere (anchor as bridge, corals as stars).

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful (“mist-clad atrium,” “reeling hush”), with strong verbs (“clutched,” “scratched out,” “trembled”). Sentences vary rhythmically; paragraphs breathe with scene needs. One paraphrase loop: “persistently curious nature” repeated twice with minimal variation. No scaffold or purple prose; metaphors cohere (mist = liminal space, pulses = unheard truth). Final line lands cleanly without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “codex margin illuminant gold fleck pulsed with rhythmic warmth” conveys object, function, and emotional valence in one phrase. Minor overwriting in “beautiful, terrible signatures” slightly muddles peak beat, but figurative logic remains coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary purposefully. Final paragraph’s lyrical compression (“eternal tide”) earns its resonance without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “snow fell in silent curtains,” “ink swirled into constellations that should not exist”—each image advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “porcelain facade shimmering like captured dawn” risks purple prose, but payoff in final shard placement justifies it. Zero paraphrase loops; every line propels toward closure’s charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield—e.g., “copper veins that hummed with the resonance of forgotten words” conveys physiology, history, and stakes in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (light as “liquid sound,” bone as “powdered memories”) and pattern-taught. Minor overwriting in the middle (“fragments of conversation, lullabies, arguments, and declarations”) slightly dilutes momentum, but closure beat remains sharp and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “wind chimes breaking in reverse” conveys uncanny sound economically, and “frostbitten hope” merges tactile and emotional registers. Sentence variety supports momentum, and paragraphs cut at pressure points. Minor overwriting in “harmony untamed” repetition—used thrice without evolving function—and “metamorphose” appears twice in close proximity, risking scaffold. No loops or artifacts dull closure; final lines land with clean propulsion. Deducted for two small redundancies in high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but “resonantly soft” recurs four times with diminishing returns, bordering on motif fatigue. One paraphrase loop: “the weight of it both anchor and key” / “anchor and key” concept repeats without added pressure. Figurative coherence holds—stone hearts, winged escape, strings of light—but “splinter steel” clashes with later “crumbled” statues (steel ≠ stone). Final paragraph’s “harbinger of wonders yet to come” leans toward abstraction, slightly dulling the otherwise image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “neon ghosts flickering in their glass coffins” does triple duty (atmosphere, metaphor, character perspective). Zero paraphrase loops; syntax varies naturally (short staccato beats during EMP deployment, longer cadences in reflection). Figurative language is coherent (“thunderstorm in a bottle,” “negative space”) and never muddles causality. Final line (“cobalt lights continued their silent, long vigil”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful—“whispered gleam,” “misting hush,” “forgotten music stirring within his bones” serve atmosphere and theme. Minor overwriting in the oasis description (“unspoiled by time’s usual ravages”) edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “silence had become both his language and his canvas” followed shortly by “communicated through his craft.” Final paragraph’s cadence is masterful, though “seed of possibility” risks slight cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but risks overwriting in peak beats: “hyperbolic space was alive, each curve a line of poetry, each angle a plot twist” borders on stacked modifiers. Minor paraphrase-loop in “stories lived here, not just as ink… not just on shelves…” slightly dulls momentum. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings diversify, and closure image (“stories lived, breathed, and waited”) lands with clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: phrases like “luminous absence,” “cipher of longing,” and “improbable beginnings” verge on abstract lyricism that risks diluting immediacy. Minor redundancy in closing paragraphs (“dream lingered… dream finally come home”) creates slight paraphrase loop. Yet rhythm is masterful, sentences multi-task, and imagery remains coherent. One scaffold beat near the end dulls propulsion just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (locks, resonance, cosmic thresholds) and pays off cleanly. Minor overwriting in “geometry of his small workshop started to slip sideways”—slightly strained—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose avoids loops but has minor density issues: “fractured patterns across the water’s surface” and “light fractured into something resembling ancient star charts” verge on paraphrase. Otherwise, high information density—“mycological chronophysics” implies whole discipline in two words. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“studying not just broken constellations...”) earns momentum. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically (“Her fingers traced… their contents protected by dust”) and do triple duty (character + setting + theme). Figurative language is coherent—mirrors, shadows, tea leaves form an integrated system. Minor overwriting in “combative tenderness” risks abstraction but is immediately grounded in action (“force of her voice… gentleness with glass”). No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence shift (“The forgotten library seemed to sigh…”) earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful, with high information density—e.g., “fingers stained with green of sap and brown of soil” conveys history, labor, and embodiment. Minor overwriting appears in the middle (“hues and scents that had no name in the ordinary world”), slightly slowing momentum. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase tendency: “radiant hush” appears twice, slightly diluting its charge. Final lines avoid purple excess, grounding lyricism in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “knots... dark with years of accumulated silence”). Figurative language is consistent—light, knots, masks—and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “symphony of hues” slightly dilutes peak pressure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold; final line earns its lyricism through prior grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield. Sentences vary syntactically; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One flaw: slight overwriting in peak beats (“charged with a presence that seemed both terrifying and familiar”) edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but “tears” metaphor recurs just enough to risk strain. Final line’s lyricism earns its weight without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (ocean as weight of unspoken goodbyes, static as desperation) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “water pressing against the reinforced portholes like the weight of a thousand unspoken goodbyes” slightly strains the metaphor, but clarity holds. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence, and the final line (“he found his own quiet release”) lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“ink infused with crushed minerals and luminescent moss” conveys method, resource, and tone). Figurative language is pattern-taught (lightning as revealer, mist as veil) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“tapestry of interconnected symbols that seemed to breathe”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“another unspoken need… another bridge”) resolves with rhythmic grace, recharging the core motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrites: “scattered light from a passing sunbeam through the frozen wall caught the lenses at an angle” could tighten. No paraphrase loops, but “unfold” repeats functionally (not ornamentally). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes during ascent, accelerates at revelation. Final line’s “affectionate detachment” risks abstraction but is anchored by fogged breath imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (“cable snapped like a taut thread,” “wound in the cerulean skin of memory”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with descent. However, “quietly explosive” appears four times—functional as refrain but risks scaffold repetition. One paraphrase loop: “spooled wholeness” used twice in close proximity without added pressure. No mixed metaphors or clarity issues, but figurative density occasionally edges toward ornamental in mid-text beats.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (light as paint, silence as shroud) and payoff-driven. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“fractally precise puzzle, each groove stretching into infinity”) borders on redundant, but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s “roadmap to infinity” risks abstraction but is anchored by the physical coin, preserving clarity. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“drifted,” “traced,” “mimicked”) and varied syntax. Figurative language is controlled—“cradle for his breakthrough thoughts” enhances without muddling. One slight redundancy: “patterns and possibilities” followed by “patterns on the dusty hopscotch board” risks near-paraphrase, but momentum holds. Final image (“light to arrive”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“driftwood nostalgia,” “ink shimmering like starlight”) and high information-per-line yield. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting appears in the climax (“kaleidoscope of images: eclipses, clocks, broken hands…”)—a slight figurative stacking—but clarity remains intact. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and efficient, with high information density—e.g., “dirt under her fingernails and a gentle smile” conveys history and character in seven words. Sentence variety supports accumulation: short clauses for discovery (“They found a hidden cave”), lyrical flows for revelation. Minor overwriting in “intricate butterflies with wings that seemed to tell stories” slightly dilutes specificity, but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull momentum. Final paragraph’s chime metaphor resonates without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally over-ornamented (“pane of hush,” “nested patterns erupted”). Minor redundancy appears in repeated descriptors (“beautifully flawed,” “bruised awe”) and near-synonym stacking (“sorrow, joy, failure, and triumph”). Sentence openings vary effectively, and rhythm supports emotional arc. However, the phrase “vouchsafe meaning” borders on register drift, and the closing lines verge on paraphrase-loop (“lullaby continued to whisper… testament… vouchsafe of meaning”), slightly dulling the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gears salvaged from fallen birds, wires woven from strands of moonlight” does triple duty. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes during assembly, tightens during bird shrieks. Minor flaw: “crystal者” appears mid-text—an apparent typo that momentarily breaks immersion. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language serves causality (“shadows like reaching arms” foreshadows guidance).

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“intricate paths through the earth like nature's own chromatography” leans decorative). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“ghost of metamorphosis” paired with “molecular arrangements of possibility”) slightly muddles physical logic. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters with abstract phrasing (“jagged edges of divided loyalties”), dulling the otherwise strong closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (light as essence, memory as sliver) and avoids muddle. However, subtle paraphrase loops appear: “mindfully scattered” repeats without added pressure; “bottled moonlight” descriptions verge on synonym churn (“tiny galaxy,” “essence of untold beginnings,” “constellation of lost chances”). No scaffold or register drift, but minor redundancy in closure beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“remorse collected like seafoam,” “columns of regret reached toward the cavern ceiling”) without overwriting. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with action. Minor figurative density in the pavilion description risks slight muddle, but coherence holds. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line perfectly echoes the opening motif, closing the textual circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “empathetically decisive fingers” and “vigorously tender quality” flirt with diagnostic label-speak. Minor redundancy appears in descriptors (“harmonious choral librarian” repeated; “construct bridges from silos” echoed verbatim). Yet rhythm varies effectively, sentence openings diversify, and information density remains high—each line advances character, setting, or theme. The closing cadence (“strong and energetic, yet profoundly caring”) risks sentimentality but lands due to prior concrete grounding. No fatal artifacts, but slight inflation prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., “dissolving like sugar in hot water” followed by “shimmering veils of forgotten dreams”). Sentence openings vary, but some adjacent lines paraphrase (“fractured yet coherent” / “chaotically precise care”). No scaffold loops, though “synaptic plasticity” repeats without added pressure. Closure image remains sharp despite minor density bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“mist coiled around her ankles, whispering in languages that predated human speech”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/refraction motifs) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in “molecular structures encoding mathematical relationships” slightly drifts into abstraction, but closure image (“refracted the coming sunrise into impossible new spectrums”) redeems with concrete lyricism. Zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “steps softer than the hedgehog’s uncurling dusk” establishes tone, character, and setting in one stroke. Figurative language is consistent (music/silence motifs) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“tapestry of sound that felt as old as the grove itself”) edges toward abstraction, slightly dulling immediacy. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or action. Final paragraph’s “quiet symphony” risks echo but earns it through earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “twilight painted the horizon in shades of lavender and charcoal” establishes tone economically. Sentences vary in structure and propulsion; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “translator of silence” phrasing borders on abstraction but is grounded by immediate tactile detail. No loops or scaffold; every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Closure image (“lined up its dent with a particularly bright point of light”) is concrete and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“patchwork kimono over cargo pants,” “frequency representing... what sound cannot express”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—phrases like “resonance of understanding itself” flirt with abstraction—but are grounded immediately by concrete action (clasp clicking open). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary naturally. One slight artifact: “theoretical sincerity” slightly repeats “theatrical yet profoundly sincere” earlier, but not enough to dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm supports emotional cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “suspended between worlds like a spider's web catching moonlight” fuses setting, mood, and theme. Sentence variety supports cadence—longer spirals for reflection, short clauses for revelation (“The seasons turned around them”). Minimal scaffold; no paraphrase loops. One slight overwriting risk (“impossible colors” at bud formation), but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “liquid spines,” “sweet decay and new growth,” “branches swaying not in wind but in rhythm with the echoes” all advance atmosphere, character, and theme. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the gravity cycle. Minor overwriting appears in “quiet chaos” and “fragile equilibrium”—slightly redundant modifiers—but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; every line earns its place, though one or two phrases flirt with purple prose near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “corrugated surfaces painted in weathered reds and blues that seemed unnaturally vibrant” does atmospheric, thematic, and character work. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes then accelerates. Minor overwriting in “rapidly adapting mind traced potential causal chains”—slightly redundant—but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (vortex, monoliths, pulse of patch) and never muddles causality.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: sentences vary in length and structure, advancing atmosphere and plot simultaneously (“Each glint of ice a high, pure note”). Figurative density peaks appropriately during the song without muddle; metaphors cohere within the synesthetic framework. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “sculpted hush” appears three times with diminishing returns. Final lines avoid scaffold, landing on the resonant “ghost of a song.”

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “avalanchingly quiet” fuses metaphor and state; sentences vary rhythmically to mirror tension. Minor overwriting in “fabric of reality began to fray like an old tapestry”—slightly mixed vehicle—but quickly grounded in sensory consequence. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“promise of what could yet be understood”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously (“fingers knowing each curve as if they were his own”). Figurative language is controlled—halo light fractures into “impossible geometries,” prints scatter like “fallen constellations”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“mathematics of emotion” repeated twice) triggers a −0.3 density penalty, but clarity at closure remains intact. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts support momentum; no loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language serves texture without overwhelming (“ribbon of liquid silver,” “vanished like morning mist”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“stories of countless winter survivals”) edges toward abstraction, but closure beat is precise. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support momentum. No loops or scaffold—each line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears (“fragile, temporary art of a frostbitten window” borders on decorative). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, and information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. One minor artifact: “truthful lies” is repeated as a motif but risks label-speak; however, it’s earned through contextual embodiment. Final lines avoid summary, resolving through charged image (“ghosts of our hearts”) that echoes earlier motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (“silence wasn’t empty—it was a barrier”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“hush of time’s unraveling tapestry” recurs thrice), slightly blurring propulsion. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “raveling silence” borders on mixed metaphor (ravel = untangle; silence as fabric?). Final image remains sharp despite lyrical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences multitask (e.g., “The silk unfurled like a river of liquid night” conveys action, image, and tone). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“molecular structures”) slightly distances immediacy, but rhythm breathes with scene needs. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (silk as river, defiance as azure). Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors Elias’s transformation—quiet but resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “ghosts of machinery” conveys decay, memory, and absence in three words. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the jump (“world dissolved… disorienting silence”) and slowing for closure. Minor overwriting appears in the final paragraph (“cartographer of his own soul”)—a slight register drift—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly controlled, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that mirror emotional cadence. Information density is strong—e.g., “ink’s faint saltwater scent” conveys setting, backstory, and character in six words. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the climax (“luminescent ache,” “sorrow so profound it felt beautiful”) risks purple prose, but the metaphors remain coherent and serve the Accumulative lens. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances atmosphere, character, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (light as memory, prophecy, song) without muddle. Minor overwriting appears in “a thousand possible futures refracted through its surface”—slightly redundant after earlier refraction imagery—but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes, and the final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors dawn’s quiet arrival. One paraphrase loop (“ancient shadows” / “shadows not yet seen”) costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “iridescent caution” encapsulates philosophy and visual phenomenon). Minor overwriting in the climax (“detonated with light… hues that had no name”) risks slight abstraction, but the concrete anchor of “purest essence of sky” redeems it. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence variety supports rhythmic breath, especially in the meditative sun-tracking passages.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “metal tools clinking softly,” “golden threads connecting the tower to the distant tree.” Sentences vary in structure and length, supporting momentum. One minor density issue: “quantified sorrow” appears three times with slight paraphrase in final third, risking scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closure image (“preserving the trees' quiet witnessing”) crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “bark etched with... hollowed-out tunes” conveys setting, history, and theme). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “fragile as a newborn’s cry” borders on cliché, and “swaddled the light, cupping it like a fragile child” verges on redundant simile stacking. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near climax (“The keeper’s hands trembled... warmth seeping”) slightly paraphrase the same emotional beat. Otherwise, rhythm and imagery are masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “nestled paradoxes,” “staying while leaving,” and “compassion no longer a retreat but an offering” do thematic, character, and atmospheric work simultaneously. Minor overwriting in “spectacular volumes of human contradiction shelved beside philosophical resolves”—slightly abstract—but quickly grounded in action. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors resolve: deliberate, luminous, uncluttered. One near-redundancy (“crumpled invitation” repeated) costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“seeds scattered like tiny prayers,” “bread’s sweetness lingering… like a promise”—without overwriting. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and every line advances atmosphere or character. Minor redundancy in “tenuous absolution” phrasing slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting occurs: “ephemeral crystals that drifted lazily before dissolving into nothingness” slightly dilutes momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats (e.g., “pulsing like a dying star”), risking slight density overload. Final lines resonate without artifact, and rhythm supports thematic cadence. Clarity remains intact despite lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “pierced,” “shatter”) and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful (“echoed like distant thunder”) without purple excess. One paraphrase loop: “false starts—failed attempts that would ultimately lead to success” repeats concept unnecessarily. Final paragraph’s “irrefutable evidence of broken trust” leans abstract; earlier concrete imagery (“pressing the watch fob against the canvas”) is stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “her body's natural response to atmospheric shifts” conveys physiology, world logic, and character in one clause. Figurative language is pattern-taught (weather = emotion) and payoff-consistent. Minor overwriting in “dactylic rhythms” slightly disrupts flow, and “terrestrially cosmic” risks abstraction but is grounded by immediate tactile context. No loops, no scaffold—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final line crystallizes the arc without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“pry,” “spilling,” “staggered”) and purposeful figurative language. Sentences vary in length and structure, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. However, adjacent lines occasionally verge on paraphrase (“sorrow in his chest gave way to… cathartic release” / “act of creation undoing years of exile”) and “auroral sorrow” appears twice with minimal evolution. No fatal artifacts, but near-purple density in the climax prevents 9+ despite high propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “gilded leaves curling with anticipation” merges action, setting, and character. Figurative language is pattern-taught (gold/brown motifs) and payoff-earned. One paraphrase loop (“shredded fragments… shredded treasure map”) and slight overwriting in “iridescent dust where crystalline waters once shimmered” prevent 9+. Rhythm varies effectively, especially in the climactic confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“his hands steadied by a lifetime of harmony” establishes character, profession, and physicality). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “refracted colors of a sunrise that had been buried for centuries” edges toward purple, though justified by the tuner’s mythic role. One paraphrase loop: “glisten-ing” appears four times with diminishing returns; final instance feels decorative, not propulsive. Otherwise, syntax varies, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“petals curling like pages burning at the edges” conveys decay, time, and fragility in one). Figurative language is coherent—fire, static, and organic motifs intertwine without contradiction. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“strangely organic tendrils already beginning to interface”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure beat (“seed… chaos contained but not destroyed”) delivers crystalline clarity. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentence openings vary purposefully to mirror rising/falling tension.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-embellished: “sandstorm calm,” “brushstroke in the masterpiece of healing,” “humming softly against his skin” risk purple prose in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“unlocked mailbox now stood open… unlocked by those who dared to listen”). Sentence openings vary well, and information density is strong—most lines advance plot or atmosphere. However, the final paragraph stacks metaphors (“canvas,” “brushstroke,” “masterpiece”), dulling the closure image’s clarity with decorative language.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. However, figurative language occasionally overloads (“ballet of decryption,” “spider spins its web” as countdown), risking slight muddle in peak beats. No paraphrase loops, but minor scaffold appears in repeated emphasis on “calm defiance.” Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final line lands cleanly—yet not flawlessly sparse enough for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—lantern light refracting through salt facets, coffee grounds dancing into maps—but avoids purple excess. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with action (shorter during gravity fluctuation). Minor redundancy in “ghostly reminders” / “ghostly but vibrant” could be tightened. No loops or scaffold; high information density in every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: metaphors like “starlight-sharp creases” and “earth’s breathing” border on purple in high-pressure beats. Minor redundancy in describing silence (“smoothed hush,” “unseen veins of hush,” “hush it was to out-silence it”). Yet rhythm varies skillfully, and key lines (“the crane’s wing flared… a tranquil blaze against the darkness”) achieve striking clarity. One paraphrase loop in the middle dulls momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “patience nimble as jasmine vines” avoids purple excess by grounding metaphor in setting. Sentence rhythms vary purposefully—longer during meteor gazing, clipped at “He knew.” Minor artifact: “meteor-laced silence” slightly strains logic (meteors don’t lace silence), but clarity holds. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“some languages are never truly dead”) resonates without summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: lines multitask (e.g., “tragedy radiant like starlight about to burn out” conveys tone, object trait, and stakes). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in one high-pressure beat (“resonance structures... vibrational frequency”) slightly slows propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“stalactites formed translucent pillars around her, each drip marked another moment she resisted fleeing”). Figurative language is coherent (aurora as shifting emerald waves, memories as drowning bodies) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in one beat (“forgery so complete it transcended its own deception”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mar peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“webs,” “hum,” “echoes”) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“segmented currents mirroring the webs of intrigue strangling…”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; final image crystallizes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “water preserved both memories and mistakes with terrible clarity” compresses theme, setting, and stakes. Sentence openings vary (“Elara descended…”, “The candle-lit shrine…”, “That night…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor flaw: “whispering to ghosts trapped beneath the waves” slightly over-explains a concept later shown more vividly. No loops or scaffold; every image (fractured glass, starlight) pays off. Final line’s “arctic night pulsed with stories” resonates without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “slick with recent showers, seemed to hum beneath her” merges touch, sound, and emotion. However, minor overwriting occurs—“scintillatingly somber” appears three times, risking label-repetition—and the phrase “cosmic echo of effort and form” edges toward abstraction. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, but two adjacent lines restate fireflies’ purpose (“not random but a map… cipher written in light”), triggering a slight paraphrase-loop deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance multiple layers (e.g., “fruit trees… stood in defiant rows” conveys setting, tone, and thematic stance). Figurative language is controlled (“radioactive morning light”). Minor redundancy in “comfortable lie… masking… truth” slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Closure image (“truth, waiting to be reassembled”) ties back cleanly without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“scribbled prophecies on star charts, his handwriting increasingly spidery”). Figurative language is coherent (storm as renewal, static as prophecy) with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “fragmented radio frequencies whispering in staccato bursts of prophecy”—slightly stacked modifiers—but clarity remains intact. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution: earth beneath feet, loneliness as fertile space.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“skittering,” “pierced,” “sweeten”) and controlled figurative language. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“achingly beautiful,” “honey of what might otherwise have been lost”)—slightly elevated diction that risks sentimentality but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple aims. Final lines avoid purple prose, grounding resonance in action (“winding the music box once more”). One paraphrase risk (“fleeting sounds” / “fleeting but not inevitably lost”) narrowly avoided penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and musical but occasionally overwrought: “fleshly and ethereal” strains metaphor coherence; “hoarded sorrows” edges into abstraction. Minor scaffold in “deliberate orchestration of his logically emotional state”—label-like. Yet rhythm varies effectively, sentences multitask (e.g., “boots crunching… harmonizing with heart’s resolve”), and closure image (“pathways of light”) avoids purple excess. One paraphrase loop (“vibrations… disarming… vibrations rose”) slightly dulls peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Strong verbs (“unyoke,” “radiated,” “shimmered”) and specific nouns (“basalt,” “viaduct,” “crystalline ice”) avoid fluff. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One flaw: mild overwriting in peak beats (“restrained wildness of growing roots breaking through stone”) risks figurative clutter, though it pays off thematically. No loops or scaffolding; closure line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is often lyrical and evocative, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structure. However, recurring figurative density—especially in high-pressure beats (“shadows danced like puppets,” “memories tangled like roots,” “lantern’s light reverberated”)—edges into overwriting. The phrase “reverberated” is used three times with diminishing returns, creating a faint template cadence. Final paragraph’s “storm inside her” / “freedom within reach” pairing risks abstraction over concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density: “tick[ed] with a rhythm so faint it was more a vibration than a sound” conveys both object and mood. Sentence variety supports rhythm—longer descriptive clauses yield to short, urgent questions at climax. One minor paraphrase loop: “deliberate pace, each motion slow and deliberate” slightly redundantly emphasizes caution. Figurative language is coherent (light as weapon, heart as monument), though “splinter” metaphor for Silas’s phrase borders on cliché. No scaffold, no purple prose; every image serves plot or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (kaleidoscope reflections, acid sea erosion) and pays off at closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally. One slight overwriting moment: “steadily curious energy” borders on label-speak, but is quickly grounded in physical twitching. Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates cleanly toward Charged Poise without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “ghost in the machine, a breadcrumb trail leading to nowhere” compresses motif and plot. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer sentences for atmosphere, staccato for action (“He found the drop”). Minor redundancy in “forgotten songs” refrain (lines 1 and 12), but payoff justifies it. No scaffold loops; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final sentence’s propulsion (“broadcasting Eva’s song on every public channel”) crystallizes momentum without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“trees bearing crystalline fruit growing in spiraling patterns” establishes setting and function). Rhythm varies purposefully—breath-like cadence during unwrapping, staccato urgency at climax. Minor overwriting in “fourteen hundred facets” (slightly excessive precision), but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language coheres (“shadow-laced,” “frost-kissed”) without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“reality slipping like sand,” “cumulative texture of a thousand small surrenders”) and avoids overwriting. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and paragraphs breathe with visual cadence. One minor flaw: slight abstraction in “fold in patience” risks label-speak, but it’s grounded by context. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final paragraph’s water metaphor (“cupped in his hands”) earns its lyricism through prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“passionate subtlety,” “amber-hued glass panels had witnessed countless destined mismatches”). Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats slightly dulls propulsion. No paraphrase loops, but phrases like “whispering secrets” and “fragile connections” flirt with abstraction. Sentence variety and rhythm support mood, yet one or two stacked modifiers (“weathered hand,” “burned love letter edge”) verge on purple prose without functional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“tempest of forgotten voices,” “abyss of sound”) slightly dilutes clarity, but metaphors remain coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors earned stillness. One near-redundancy (“consecrated… again”) costs 0.3, but momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“hinges sighing like an old secret” conveys history and sound). Figurative language is consistent (light/shadow, weaving, botany) without muddle. Minor overwriting in the climax (“constellation of shared pain transmuted into something beautiful”) slightly softens impact, but rhythm accelerates effectively toward closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“chill seeping into his bones,” “heart a slow, heavy drum”). Figurative language is purposeful (“first light finger the spines”) and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “symphony of an ending” borders on abstraction but is grounded by preceding concrete sounds. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line crystallizes motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“junkyard prophet,” “tidal longing,” “static of the world”). Figurative language is coherent—water/tide metaphors unify mind (sandbar), emotion (longing), and setting (fog)—without muddle. Minor overwriting in one beat (“low hum beneath the static… resonance that only he… seemed to hear”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence (“clinging to echoes… finally captured”) delivers earned lyricism without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“luminous ache,” “plucked string,” “unshed tears”), but occasional overwriting risks clarity—e.g., “rebellion of metal against order” slightly strains metaphor coherence. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts feel intentional. Minor scaffold in “he had to… he hurried… he stood” sequence, but not repetitive enough to trigger loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“hovered,” “plucking,” “tracing”) and varied syntax. Information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. One paraphrase loop: “fragile yet persistent” / “fragile yet persistent hope” echoes redundantly. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “sea of cotton-white peaks” slightly clashes with later “blushed with pink” clouds—minor tonal drift. Final paragraph’s “one note at a time” risks cliché but earns resonance through context.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (“shadows danced at noon, defying the sun’s tyranny”). Figurative language is coherent (shadows as “liquid smoke,” stars “like shattered glass”) and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “her focus narrowly aimed… ignored them” slightly dulls immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Final paragraph’s rhythm modulates perfectly—exhaustion to resolve—without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“bones are setting incorrectly between worlds” conveys worldbuilding, stakes, and urgency in six words). Figurative language is consistent (starlight as binding/revelation motif) and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold appears in “her notes completed for the day, Eleanor drove…”—a slight momentum dip—but it’s brief and serves spatial transition. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary naturally. Final line (“fractures… meant to be navigated”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—each image serves character, theme, and atmosphere. Sentence openings vary (“Elara walked,” “The grotto seemed,” “She knelt”), and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“reflectively vibrant in its potential, though its luster yet lay hidden”), risking slight figurative saturation, but clarity at closure remains intact. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; propulsion aligns with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“synthetic animals returned to organic form,” “methodical maps of moisture”), though occasional overwriting appears (“honeyed hush” used thrice). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, mirroring emotional shifts. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor deduction for slightly strained metaphor (“amber warm against her sternum” borders on precious), but closure image remains lucid and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (watercolor rain, molten silver geometry) and pays off in closure. However, adjacent redundancies appear: “conflicted about his craft” followed by “understood writing wasn’t creation but extraction” slightly paraphrases. A few stacked modifiers (“sacred space,” “lucidly watchful”) flirt with purple prose but remain legible. No fatal artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, sometimes risking overload (“moon’s light pooled like liquid gold,” “melody threading like a vine tendril”). A few adjacent lines verge on paraphrase (“the arbor’s gathering hush deepened… turned to reverent stillness”). Yet rhythm varies effectively, and key images land with precision. The final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, though “spun new golden stories” echoes earlier phrasing slightly too closely for flawless line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or ritual mechanics. Figurative language is pattern-taught (starlight “alive and sentient,” glass as “resonance chamber”) and pays off in the luminous map. Minor overwriting in “organizations of light that could capture and amplify the rhythms of life” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s propulsion—“preserving not just copper and starlight but the continuity of knowledge”—resolves with earned lyricism, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff (e.g., “stories would gather like condensation on stone” conveys setting, theme, and mechanics). Rhythm varies purposefully: languid during observation, taut at testing. Minor overwriting in one beat (“resonant crystals that responded to specific frequencies” slightly redundant), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence—“The harvest was secured...”—resonates without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent (shadows pulse like circuits, silence presses like weight) and pattern-taught early. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density is high (“whalebone reverie,” “metallic veins”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“light but endless threads pulled taut across eternity”) risks slight muddle, but clarity holds. Final line crystallizes theme without redundancy, satisfying read-aloud rhythm and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “shavings fell like soft snow” conveys action, atmosphere, and emotional tone). Figurative language is coherent (raindrops as lenses, grief as raw material) and peaks without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Minor deduction: “crystallized time” slightly risks abstraction but is grounded by immediate context (shifting light on wood).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “chronologically confused time twisted his memories into bits of dialogue”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“dreams and disappointments tangled in the mist”) slightly dulls momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language remains coherent (lagoon as cage → rhythm). Final paragraph avoids purple prose; “humbly free” risks abstraction but is anchored by physical action (“stepped into the unknown”).

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water flowed, then pooled, then began to creep” varies rhythm while advancing action. Figurative language is controlled (sextant as “sliver of captured star”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “maze of intentions... labyrinth of forgotten dreams” risks synonym churn, but payoff justifies it. Closure beat (“threshold crossed”) avoids artifacts; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled—“glacial hush,” “petrichor nostalgia,” and “excruciatingly gentle” recur with purpose. However, “excruciatingly gentle” appears three times with diminishing returns, bordering on scaffold. One paraphrase loop: “bear not just the memory… but its continuing presence” echoes later as “bear his abandoned dream not as a burden.” Final paragraph’s “soundless sanctuary had become complete” slightly over-explains; image alone would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“errant legend seeker… more like a legend’s undertaker”). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no purple excess. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-story, creating a faint rhythmic uniformity, but closure lines (“blueprints for the bridges we wish we could cross”) land with perfect clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “fulgurite glass—hollow and twisted as lightning’s frozen scream” conveys object, origin, and metaphor in one stroke. Figurative language is coherent (lightning/frost/smoke motifs interlock) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in “oceanic hush” repetition, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“all was still beneath the snow’s silent descent”) resolves with rhythmic and thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency—e.g., “geography of healing mapped through careful curation” conveys concept, character, and setting in one phrase. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (thread as narrative weave, garden as archive). Minor overwriting in “vivid as he projected” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its resonance without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “crystalline floors vibrating with the hum of a thousand clockwork mechanisms” establishes setting, sound, and mood in one phrase. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “snake-like” thread borders on mixed metaphor amid otherwise light/shadow imagery. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “quaking reverie” repeats three times—functional as motif, not redundancy. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates then stills with Kael’s breath, mirroring collapse and peace.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“flame she’d learned to tame,” “black glass,” “symphony of resilience”) and pays off in the closing image. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“quiet promise of rebirth,” “foundation of her argument against despair”)—slightly abstract where concrete sensation would deepen immersion. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are sharp, and the final line’s “first, clear note” echoes the opening grace, creating resonant cadence without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—stained glass catching light, geese like scissors—but avoids purple overload by grounding metaphors in action. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and paragraphs cut meaningfully. One paraphrase loop: “unstick the box… had unstick himself” echoes awkwardly; also, “defiant hush” repeats without evolution. Final third remains artifact-free, preserving closure clarity. High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “petal unfurling—a slow, silken motion that had repeated for eons” conveys time, texture, and stagnation in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (light as river, gear as secret), though “Canada edges” is a jarring typo that briefly obscures imagery. Minor overwriting in “weaving them into a net of warmth”—slightly redundant after “strands of photon.” Otherwise, propulsion is strong, with varied sentence lengths and zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“ribbon coiled like a dormant serpent,” “thundering calm”), but occasional overwriting appears: “the shimmer of ghostly wings” borders on purple prose, and “spectral mentorship” repeats with slight paraphrase. Still, rhythm supports pressure, and closure remains sharp. One minor loop in describing the ribbon’s role slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“brass heart,” “ghost of his failure”) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “slow, heavy, and impossibly steady” slightly dulls the descent beat, but rhythm otherwise varies naturally. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight the pendulum motif with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lantern cutting through the velveteen gloom that clung… like memory itself” merges image, atmosphere, and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with action (short during untangling). One paraphrase loop: “frayed threads… began to fray” (lines 14–15) triggers −0.2. Figurative language is coherent (threads = souls, gloom = memory), though “stormy blue that vibrated” slightly strains physics. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; high information density maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. However, figurative language occasionally overwhelms propulsion: phrases like “ink flowed like a river, carving paths where none existed” verge on ornamental. Minor redundancy appears in descriptions of the quill (“feather flickered,” “feather dancing”). Still, rhythm varies effectively, and the final lines achieve resonant clarity without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “mist curled around him like a cloak of forgotten time” conveys atmosphere, emotion, and theme). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shimmering shapes—the ghosts of stories long lost”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every image serves escalation or closure. Final line (“dust danced around him”) recharges the opening motif with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “porcelain shards gleaming with a soft, inner light” does triple duty (image, emotion, theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (fragility motifs recur without muddle), and sentence openings vary (“The rocking chair groaned...” / “Elias stepped forward...”). Minor redundancy in “mirage of safety” phrasing (lines 6 and 14) slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks mar peak beats. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the rocking chair’s fade—elegant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line: “abrasive calm,” “sedimentary layers that held centuries of secrets,” “methodical mapping of coastlines.” Sentence rhythm varies effectively, though occasional overwriting appears (“rationally rebellious caver in the sunken city ruins” stacks modifiers). The Chinese insertion disrupts flow and isn’t integrated stylistically. No paraphrase loops, but “competing narratives” repeats without deepening; final paragraph’s clarity compensates, though minor register drift (“epistemological diversity”) slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“leaves pressed themselves against windows,” “chord hung like autumn amber”), but occasional overwriting dilutes propulsion—e.g., “subtracting noise” repeats four times with diminishing returns. Minor paraphrase loop: “vanishing arts” appears in near-identical contexts twice. No scaffold or momentum drag, but figurative density in mid-story slightly blurs focus without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (“nectar dusk,” “fallen stars”) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “honeyed glow” and “silver sheen” slightly edges toward ornament, but rhythm remains varied and propulsion steady. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final paragraph lands with clean, resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “windows rattling softly in response to some cosmic pressure” merges image, sound, and scale. Figurative language is controlled—“photograph fading in sunlight,” “violet fingerprint scent”—never muddled. Minor overwriting in the final paragraph (“sanctify the space between what is and what might be”) slightly dilutes momentum, but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support the Accumulative lens without loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “stainless trellises, where once blossoms clung” conveys loss economically; “bubble of air that trembled with his every silent thought” merges physics and emotion. Minor overwriting in “cascade, a torrent of revelations” slightly muddles peak beat, but clarity holds. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold—every line advances atmosphere, character, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical, with high information density (“air grew heavier,” “chalk borrowed from memory”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with pressure. Minor flaws: slight overwriting in “tapestry of numbers weaving through the void” (mixed metaphor), and “fragile hope” borders on cliché. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines restate the dice’s role (“link to that moment,” “gamble he’d lost”), costing ~0.3. Closure beat remains sharp and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “moth’s wings,” “roadmap of sorrows,” and “syntax of lost languages” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphor in character perspective. Sentence openings vary (“Elara traced…”, “The smog-choked city…”, “She moved…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “methodically hopeful” appears twice with minimal variation, slightly dulling immediacy. Otherwise, high information density—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—“slick as oil” conveys both visual texture and danger; “yeast and grief” merges sensory and emotional registers. Minor overwriting in “rosewater dread that clung to the limestone walls” slightly dilutes urgency, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final line’s “fragile, rosewater-scented hope of thaw” perfectly echoes opening tremor imagery with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (“hunger stone half-buried in the muck… pulse with latent radiance”). Sentence openings vary (“He placed it…”, “The yoyo began…”, “He thought of…”), and rhythm accelerates toward the climax. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“discordant tune that vibrated through his bones, a sound that was both creation and undoing”) edges toward abstraction, slightly dulling immediacy. No loops or scaffold; closure image (“faintest echo of a backward-ticking clock”) is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “photographically cursed” conveys condition, consequence, and metaphor in three words). Figurative language is pattern-taught: luminance, distortion, and mirrors recur with evolving meaning. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One slight overwriting beat: “horror and beauty of death’s lingering luminance” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by immediate physical consequence (clasp burns white-hot).

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield (“roots that had learned to drink saltwater,” “fractal generating that the tide herself had taught”). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “mathematics of the impossible” slightly strains credibility, but rhythm varies naturally and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure beat (“already composing”) lands cleanly without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “sun bleached white,” “trembling hands,” “humid air” advance atmosphere and character. High information density—e.g., “rust shut three seasons ago” implies time and decay. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (shells as maps, city as organism). One paraphrase loop: “pattern languages” repeated without added pressure. No scaffold or purple prose; final line resonates without overwriting. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though two adjacent “she would…” constructions slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with high information density (“iron skeleton wrapped in ivy like a forgotten promise”). However, figurative language occasionally overloads: three metaphors in quick succession (“pit of lies,” “pretty facade,” “trapped star”) risk purple prose. Minor paraphrase loop: “decay” and “moral rot” echo redundantly. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but mid-story has slight scaffold in thematic exposition (“symptoms!”).

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“crystalline puzzle pieces,” “interlaced absence”) and high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with pacing, and rhythm supports emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “twilight’s bruised canvas” and “unpublished futures” edges toward abstraction, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Closure beat remains uncluttered, though one or two modifiers (“stoically sensitive,” “seawater-resistant”) verge on label-like convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentences advance plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (“The brass design depicted an octopus encircling a spiral tower—a motif repeated throughout…”). Minor overwriting in “miraculously readable pages” slightly dilutes specificity, and “feverish determination” borders on stock phrasing. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with the scene—candle flickers mirrored in syntactic cadence—and the final image lands with clean resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “smoky quartz, polished to a gem-like translucence” does triple duty. Minimal scaffolding; every image serves theme or character. One slight overwriting in “fragile rainbows that danced among the tea bonsais”—“danced” verges on cliché, but doesn’t dull closure. Otherwise, zero loops, strong verbs, varied syntax, and impeccable rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density (“circuit breakers cooled their relay-sensitive hearts” merges tech and biology). Figurative language is pattern-taught (geode = potential = screen patterns) and pays off. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“anticipatory horror and ecstasy of touching something that should not exist but did”) slightly muddles clarity. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. Final line lands with resonant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: “brilliant dimness,” “mechanical firefly,” “emotional symphonies” do triple duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“brilliance and dimness swirled together… time itself called into question”) risks figurative blur. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “missing pieces” echoed without added pressure. Closure line sharp, recharging opening motif with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“frozen sea” of regret, “blood”-tinged twilight) and varied syntax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. One near-overwriting moment: “sieved hush that fell between them... as if all the significant sounds had been filtered out” risks explanatory redundancy. Otherwise, high information density and rhythmic control support the Accumulative design without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Minor overwriting in “mist curled around the stone ramparts like fingers”—slightly strained simile—but not repeated. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure beat remains clear despite figurative language. One near-redundancy (“unfinished business” / “past failure”) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“crunched,” “dredging,” “sliced”) and rhythmic control that mirrors paddling cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “merrily melancholic smile belying the turmoil beneath” risks abstraction, though quickly grounded by physical detail. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density is high (e.g., “brass worn smooth from years of her father’s grip” conveys legacy, loss, and tactile history in one phrase). Final line’s resonance (“broken navigators can find their way home”) avoids sentimentality through earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: “delicately robust,” “heat on asphalt,” “water-worn tunnels” all advance atmosphere and theme. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, though one minor redundancy appears (“labyrinth of choices” stated twice). No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; every image pulls weight. Final paragraph’s cadence (“light swallowed him whole… dim, jaded awe”) delivers closure with poetic precision, not purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—embers of possibility, petals soft as whispers—but avoids purple overload by tethering metaphors to action (smoke patterns mimic Shadowpaw’s sleeping positions). Sentence variety supports momentum: short clauses during transformation (“Her fingers elongating. Her senses expanding.”), flowing syntax in reflection. One paraphrase loop (“transformed yet unchanged, bound by love that transcended form itself”) slightly dulls the final beat, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“robes flowing like spilled midnight,” “time pooled like liquid mercury”), but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, yet mixed metaphors emerge (“birth had changed everything... hollowed her soul into a vessel”) where “vessel” clashes with later “weight” imagery. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with abstract summary (“forever willingly perplexed”).

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“groaned,” “pulsing,” “stitch”) and sensory selectivity. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“immeasurable compassion,” “ancient power”) edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one register drift (“divine mercy”) slightly jars. Sentence variety supports momentum; closure image is clean and resonant without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“tiny cosmos in his grasp,” “rogue star”) and coherent. However, slight overwriting appears in “whispering hush” repetitions and “vibrant hush” used twice—borderline paraphrase loop. Final paragraph’s “fragile and eternal” risks abstraction but is grounded by the crunch of sand. No fatal artifacts, but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive (“fingers tracing the ancient metal,” “bronze quill holder trembled slightly”), with strong verbs and concrete nouns. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “winking hush of the twilight courtyard”—slightly ornamental. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “inexplicable… no explanation” in paragraph 2. Final beat remains clear despite slight register lift in “spark a silent revolution.”

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but purposeful; figurative language serves accumulation (“slipping through her hands like liquid silver”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths breathe with ritual pacing. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: “burning with violet and emerald fire” borders on stacked modifiers, and “resonant energies” slightly muddles the tactile climax. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near the end (“sacred patterns contained not in equations… but in the spaces between them” echoes earlier phrasing). Closure image remains sharp despite slight density.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (“paper tearing like a wound reopening”). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “storm-kissed wonder,” “rarefy, distill into their purest form” verge on elevated diction that borders on mannered. No loops or scaffolding, but two adjacent lines summarize the poet’s state rather than dramatize it (“felt furiously tranquil… quiet rage mingled with awe”), costing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“shadow a fractured compass,” “threads coiled like fates untold”—but avoids overwriting through precise verbs and varied syntax. Minor artifact: slight repetition in “duel” references (“fencing match of ideas,” “duel had begun,” “duel intensified”), though not looped. Final paragraph achieves earned lyricism without sentimentality. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, with mechanical clicks and brook murmurs creating auditory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “welded from scrap metal and populated by donations from those who still believed in democracy of stories” fuses setting, theme, and politics. Rhythm varies—short clauses during tension (“Somewhere, a banned flower was blooming”), flowing syntax in reflection. Minor overwriting in “accumulated dreams of everyone who had joined this luminous fracture” slightly strains metaphor but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“worn smooth by years of melodies that had come and gone like strangers”). Figurative language is coherent (tides, film, clock interweave naturally), though occasional lyricism borders on ornamental (“horizon where day bled into night”). No loops or scaffold; momentum builds cleanly to the climax. Final line (“time would remember how to bend”) resonates without overstatement, closing the motif with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“blossoms unfurling like apologetic palms” risks mixed metaphor). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor scaffold in “luminous doubt” repetition, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure. Final paragraph’s cadence effectively crystallizes the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual ebb and flow. Minor overwriting in “rhythmically placid grace” and “cerulean shades” slightly dilutes immediacy, but figurative language remains coherent. No loops or scaffold; high information density without redundancy. Final line (“tides of remembrance continued their eternal ebb and flow”) resonates without overstating.
