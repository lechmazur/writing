  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from pervasive template cadence and phrase recycling: "steadily adaptive" (3×), "drifting resonance" (4×), "scorched testament" (3×), and synonym loops around "pauses" and "luminous." Stock metaphors recur without reweighting ("cooling glass," "frosting... with delicate veils"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, and several beats paraphrase adjacent content (e.g., paragraphs on frost patterns repeat the alignment mechanic). Filter-verb stacks ("she would retrace," "she saw," "she traced") dull immediacy in key discovery beats. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "silently expressive" appears four times, "unshaken marvels" five times, "heat-mapped" eight times, often in near-identical constructions. Runs of identical sentence stems in the climax ("She struck… She gathered… She selected… She placed") create mechanical rhythm. Stock metaphors ("eyes lit with purpose," "heart burned") and therapy-speak labels ("scarlet fury," "teal resolve") cluster in peak beats. Filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she noticed," "she found") dull immediacy. The closure paragraph is summary rather than scene. Multiple artifact types across the final third disallow 9+ globally and trigger cumulative penalty beyond baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is ambitious with strong imagery (bioluminescent anemones, petrified scrolls, mocking echo of the surface) and varied syntax. Overwriting clusters in metaphorical density: "drowned tomes swelled with eternal silence," "fractured prisms scattering faint rainbows," "impossible spaces—folds in the water where vacuum pockets defied physics." These pile figurative language in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.5. Minor loops: "weariness lifted, merging with the light" and "weary from decades of this futile toil" echo conceptually. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No generation artifacts or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear across adjacent lines: "anonymous donations" / "gifts" / "bundles" / "donations" cycle without added pressure; "gently persistent" appears four times; "amplified quiet" recurs as a stock phrase. Template cadence runs: "Mira watched... She saw... Her motivation burned... Mira began... Mira knelt... Mira organized... Mira knew... Mira lifted... Mira smiled." Filter-verb stacks ("She saw the potential," "Mira knew the moment") and elevated diction ("ripple in the amplified quiet," "shadow fairies," "malevolent fireflies") clash with the POV's otherwise grounded texture. These artifacts touch multiple beats including the climax assembly, triggering the −0.6 to −1.4 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("Fog clung… like a half-remembered dream," "foggy lucidity," "blooming rail ties") without pattern-teaching or payoff, cluttering peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "spiritually curious" recurs three times, "foggy lucidity/lucid" four times, "sparks" nine times without meaningful reweighting. Template cadence: "He [verb]" sentence stems repeat across the opening third. Stock metaphor ("inner fire") and elevated diction ("hoarding unused love in a sacred vessel") clash with immediacy during the healing climax. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work (tear + projection + wound), but scaffold sentences ("Now, driven to find…") slow momentum. Clarity remains adequate; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose carries high figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff: nearly every sentence in the climax stacks metaphor ("pseudospherical helices," "fractal spirals," "luminous motes"), and mixed vehicles blur clarity—vines "pulse with sap like veins of forgotten epochs" conflates biological and temporal scales without coherent logic. Template cadence pervades: "trembled in quaking reverie," "quaking deeper into reverie," "garden quaked in sympathy" recycles the root across three beats without added pressure. Paraphrase loops appear ("retrocognitive trap," "retrocognitively trapped," "retrocognitive chains") and synonym churn inflates texture ("quaking," "trembling," "quivering") without advancing sense. Filter-verb stacks in the climax ("began to disintegrate," "feeling time's texture ripple") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors ("shadows of yesterday clung to every leaf," "memories dissolving in rain") reduce specificity. Information density is low—many lines restate concept without scene action. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −0.8 for template cadence and metaphor stacks, escalated to −1.2 because artifacts pervade the closure beat ("warping into fractal spirals," "flaking into luminous motes").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose exhibits heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence. "Patiently strategic" and "staggering grace" recur mechanically without new information. Identical sentence stems: "Elara, the chained liberator," "With staggering grace, she..." Metaphors are mixed or strained: "cotton candy ghosts," "dance of poised calculation," "shadows of poise." The piano-cipher mechanism is explained mid-action, stalling momentum. Stock phrasing pervades: "her heart quickened," "her eyes locked on," "emerged into the pandemonium." Figurative density in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers overwriting penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades the piece: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("skeletal husks," "serpentine dance," "drowned sailors," "crystalline snap cascading into abyssal hush") without variation in density or pattern-teaching. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "memories' impact ravaged him, splintering focus, yet fueled invention" is restated in "memories surged" and later "memories' impact crystallized." Template cadence runs through several beats ("He began by collecting... Back in the forge... Finally, the imprint set"). The forge sequence includes simultaneous actions described with participles that obscure sequence clarity. Register drifts into academic/poetic idiom ("mitotic fire," "coruscating") that clashes with the survival-craftsman POV. Information density is high but momentum drags under the weight of constant figuration.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "luminous disbelief" / "disbelief glowing" / "disbelief flickered luminous"; "illuminated moment" / "illuminated moments"; "reinterpreted" appears four times with near-identical function. Template cadence runs dominate ("Her motive burned quietly within: to press her ear…"; "Quietly savvy, she moved…"; "Elara smiled quietly…"). Figurative density (golden hour, amber fire, liquid jade, destiny's door, fate's hinge) appears in most sentences without clear propulsion, triggering overwriting penalties. Stock metaphors ("heart raced," "smiled quietly") and synonym churn measurably dull closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("molten soul," "liquid fire," "inflate the void"), synonym churn ("thoughtfully spirited" appears three times with no new meaning), and template cadence ("He hefted… he marveled… he proclaimed"). Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the glassblowing sequence without pattern-teaching triggers −0.7. Paraphrase loops ("thawing" recurs six times across adjacent paragraphs) and grandiose diction ("epochal," "primordial," "tyranny") break momentum. The prose obscures rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops: "fears not chains, but the key" / "phobias not gone but powerful allies"; "she knew vulnerability was power" / "proving vulnerability's power" / "vulnerability's unyielding truth." Template cadence dominates the opening ("She leaped... she channeled... he orchestrated"). The visible meta-scaffold in the final third ("No—word count overrun," "wait, refine to fit") is a catastrophic artifact that obliterates momentum. Mixed metaphors: "transformative betrayal" is a label, not an image; "whispers murmuring" / "whispers amplifying" / "seashell murmuring audibly" cycles through synonym churn. The ending's three false starts create structural loops that obscure the intended closure action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense ("ambered hush," "marbled," "flaking gold leaf") and often clusters without pattern-teaching: "ambered hush" appears in opening, middle, and close but functions as label rather than reweighting image. Paraphrase loops: "The ambered hush deepened" followed by "storms outside a distant roar" restates stillness without adding pressure. Template cadence: "He nodded… He rose… He opened… He pointed… He sketched" stacks identical stems across five sentences mid-story. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks. Applying −0.6 for template cadence and −0.3 for paraphrase loop (total −0.9) and noting the meta-commentary in the final bracket disrupts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose demonstrates controlled rhythm and varied sentence openings in places ("In that cycle," "Here, thoughts flickered," "Third loop"), but suffers from template cadence in the loop-reporting section (lines 16–27: repeated "loop" + colon structures). Paraphrase loops appear: "Sweeping resumed" echoes "He resumed sweeping"; "amalgamation accelerated" and "amalgamating all prior insights" restate the same concept. The phrase "remarkably composed" recurs three times without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly clear ("frost patterns on glass," "veiling hidden truths"), though "mundane mysticism" and "temporal recursion" edge toward abstraction. The closing lines achieve momentum with short declaratives, but earlier sections accumulate scaffold. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (template runs, paraphrase loops) totaling approximately −1.0, with slight additional deduction for repeated label.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "quiet night registrar, Elias" then "The quiet night registrar had succeeded"; "ambiguously clear" recurs as a phrase four times without evolving meaning. Template cadence is frequent ("She came to listen... fleeing before..."; "He sketched swiftly: a fractured heart... a shadowed figure... mirrors reflecting..."). Figurative density in the opening ("crystal whispering," "resonant hush," "mirror sheen amplifying whispers into symphony") stacks metaphors without causal work, and mixed vehicles ("timeframe after words become unnecessary" is conceptually strained). Register drifts into abstract exposition ("the core that bound them both") at the climax, flattening momentum. The final third maintains this density, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character, world, or conflict. However, several passages exhibit overwriting: "the orb scanners to make luck measurable at last," "clusters of crimson roses thrusting defiantly from tendrils shriveled by neglect," "symbols of past failures he would redeem" stack metaphor and modifier without urgency. The "mended deception" explanation is a paraphrase loop—Elias tells what the reader has just witnessed in the scanner jump. Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence: "he would sweep... arrange... murmur... take up... polish." The final paragraph ("In Eldergrove, bloom and wither danced eternal...") is summary rather than image. No major causality breaks, but density dips in expository beats.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy overwriting clusters in opening and climax: "colossal winged specimens slumbered," "velvet shroud," "mechanically warm touch—her tools humming softly, infused with the steady pulse of recycled starlight that mimicked a heartbeat." Multiple paraphrase loops ("hush of beating wings at rest" / "profound stillness" / "restful hush"). The meta-scaffold at the end ("But wait, trim to fit… actual count adjusts… No, recalibrate… story pure") is unacceptable in finished prose, reading as generation artifact that obscures the closure beat. Template cadence appears in mid-section with repeated "Elara had" and "the nexus" openings.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries repeated phrasing and template cadence: "Lately inspired" appears three times with minimal variation, "in-between spaces" recurs as a label across multiple beats, and several paragraphs open with identical stems ("He [verb]," "Elias [verb]"). Figurative language ("hush of unstruck chords," "flooded echoes faded, but inspiration endured") clusters without clear payoff. Information density is adequate in the middle but drops in the final third, where summary replaces scene pressure. Lines like "Flooded echoes faded, but inspiration endured" and "Her code, unraveled, promised resurrection" read as scaffold rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose carries a lyric texture but suffers from heavy figurative density in nearly every sentence without payoff variation—"knife-edge peak," "reluctant prophecies," "auroral sorrow," "mountain grasses," "bitter berry," "stone in her gut," "lightning veins," "leaden sky," "old grief," "mournful reel." Template cadence clusters appear ("her fault-tolerant nature," "fault-tolerant oracle," "fault-tolerant words," "fault-tolerant soul"). Paraphrase loops recur: "swaying certainties" / "certainties had swayed" / "certainties forever swaying." Register drift into abstraction ("cumulative mass," "hazy symbiosis") clashes with visceral setting. These artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact penalty and 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "Drowsy alertness sharpened" echoes "drowsy alertness" three times; "The weight crashed in" / "The weight lifted" toggle without advancing pressure; "beads snapping free like absolution beads" recycles the word "beads" redundantly. Figurative language clusters densely in the closure paragraph ("feather-light revelation," "heavier than chains, yet buoyant," "mill-dust phantoms") without clear vehicle coherence. Stock metaphors ("truth expelled… yet buoyant") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("swallowed truth," "remorse," "absolution") dull immediacy in peak beats. Sentence openings vary, but information density is uneven—some lines do double work (beads as rosaries, valve as confessional) while others summarize ("No ghosts, no gods") what the prior image already conveyed.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout (pages as "obedient," soil "parting like obedient pages," refuge "gleaming like congealed night"), creating coherent texture but risking overwriting in non-peak beats. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He gathered no tools… he followed… he began… he chanted" runs four consecutive subject-verb openers without variation. Minor paraphrase loop: "crumbling peace" recurs six times with minimal reweighting until the ending. Information density is moderate; several lines (e.g., "Here, the chronicle keeper dwelled…") summarize rather than propel. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "softly adaptive" appears five times, "cautious exuberance" three times, "dreaming roots" four times, "lifelong wonder" twice, "ordinary magic" three times, always in similar syntactic slots. The final third contains heavy scaffold: "Elias smiled inwardly; his motivation realized in her rekindled gaze. Sage Ridge faded behind, but its hush lingered in their souls. In nurturing her wonder, he'd linked his own healing, ordinary magic proving softly adaptive once more." These lines restate prior content without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster: "voice like whispering wind," "eyes dull as polished stones," "curl soft as dawn light," "thread of lifelong wonder." Filter verbs ("he knew," "he'd found," "he hoped") stack in exposition without voice-driven necessity. High information density in the eclipse beat (corona glow, premature stars, birds silent) is strong, but the descent epilogue loops theme statements and dilutes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor or figurative flourish ("bronze quiet deepened to a hush of aged metal," "pages curled like dying leaves," "stars in a skewed sky") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence and synonym churn appear throughout ("odd historian," "sensitively perceptive," "bronze quiet" recur as labels). Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines (e.g., paragraphs 4–5 restate axis-tilt effects). Applying density penalty (−0.6), coherence penalty for mixed metaphors (−0.5), and loop penalty (−0.4); total artifact debt −1.5. Line-level density ≤7.0 triggers cross-cap: Q6 capped at 7.6, 9+ disallowed globally.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is generally high, but several prose artifacts drag momentum. Paraphrase loops: "orchestrate their unmasking, directing the flow of their covert streams into chaos" restates the same intent. Template cadence: "Elias, from above, seized…transposing…directing…" stacks gerunds mechanically. Stock metaphors: "rusty lock," "minor key," "symphony." The phrase "accidentally prophetic" recurs three times without variation. Figurative density is high in expository passages ("transpose your key," "shadow puppeteer," "eternal stage") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is moderate; some beats (the baking of new cookies, the beam manipulation) are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing sentence-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "decorated with silence" recurs five times, "unraveled stillness" four times, "muffled clarity" three times, often in identical syntactic slots without cumulative pressure. Runs of "He [verb]" and "Elias [verb]" stems (seven consecutive sentences in the middle third) create drumbeat monotony. Stock metaphors ("tendrils coiling," "fog lifting") and stacked modifiers ("vast chamber of whispering voids where time folded without creasing and space breathed without expanding") blur sense. Information density is low: many sentences restate the same action (looping, painting, exposing assumptions) without advancing situation or narrowing options. The final paragraph summary ("possession thwarted," "victory a quiet hymn") recapitulates rather than propelling forward.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "chronologically homesick" appears five times, "upturned hush" four times, "mirrored horizon" three times, often in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the middle section with repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across consecutive sentences. Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("she felt," "she closed her eyes, summoning"), dulling immediacy. Mixed metaphors appear: "silence pooled like spilled mercury" (a liquid simile) followed by "upturned hush" (an oxymoron that contradicts "pooled"). Stock phrases ("dawn approached," "before exhaustion hit") lack specificity. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("She had woven every thread"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "fractured timelines" and "splintered possibilities" restate the same concept across adjacent lines; "darkening brightness" appears three times without reweighting. Template cadence runs ("He descended… boots skimming… pressed the tablet"; "He floated through… the tablet pulsing") stack filter constructions and synonym churn. Stock metaphors ("dying star," "maze of the soul") appear without transformation. Figurative density in peak beats (the doppelganger confrontation) obscures rather than sharpens: "shadow-cloaked," "chorus of lost timelines," "procedural unraveling" pile abstraction on abstraction. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries figurative density ("shadows pooled like forgotten echoes," "horn flared like a petrified shout," "slender thread of perfect silence") that accumulates without always advancing pressure; several images feel ornamental. Paraphrase loops appear: "audibly muted" recurs three times in similar constructions, and "filament of hush" is repeated with synonym variants ("mirrored hush," "living hush") across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence is visible in sentence openings ("Elara's students," "Elara's motivation," "Elara froze"). The final paragraph summarizes rather than showing the decisive moment, flattening momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "solitude was her sanctuary" / "In this courtyard's layered tranquility"; "integrity" recurs five times with similar framing; "layered tranquility" appears three times. Template cadence runs appear in the final third ("Solitude nurtured, integrity bloomed. The pigeon's distant coo…"). Figurative language is dense without always advancing pressure ("storms mask the spread," "solitude's forge," "calm eye"), and the closing string of short declaratives reads mechanical. Information density is high in the deduction sequence but dilutes in the reflective closing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "frayed rope / fraying further / frayed anew," "pattern / patterns / patterned," "ethically playful" appears four times, "passionate subtlety" twice, "texture of time" six times. Template cadence in the middle third: "He traced... / Now free... / The grotto's... / Their energy... / Elias's heart..." Nearly every paragraph opens with a subject-verb stem. Stacked filter constructions ("he recognized," "he felt," "he fingered") dull immediacy. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed: "veins of forgotten lightning" (veins pulse, lightning does not), "temporal snags" (abstract jargon). The overwriting and loop density trigger −1.2 in Q7; presence in the final third disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies between longer scene-setting sentences and short closural fragments, creating visual cadence. Information density is high in the greenhouse description and ritual sequence, but paraphrase loops appear: "chronic hush" recurs ~8 times, "unfinished" ~6 times, and "magnificent simplicity" is invoked twice without reweighting. Template cadence emerges in the final third: "Lir [verb]. [Noun phrase]. [Noun phrase]." runs across multiple lines ("Lir smiled... Lir tucked away... Lir stood alone... Lir walked on..."), dulling propulsion. Figurative language is dense ("threads," "unbind," "echo-harbor") but occasionally stacks without clear vehicle logic. The closure beat is legible, yet the repetitive stems and motif recycling in the final paragraph lower line-level control. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence touching the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple text-pattern artifacts harm momentum: "affectionate" appears seven times across the piece (affectionate embrace, affectionate detachment, affectionate veil, affectionate illusion, affectionate echoes, etc.), creating a label loop that dulls specificity. Template cadence appears in stacked "professionally thorough" mentions and repeated "half-truth" constructions. The phrase "Elias, the counterfeit emotion dealer" and similar appositive labels feel scaffolded. Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "affectionate detachment" → "fond removal" → "affectionate echoes" restate without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("forbidden flower," "lover's parting touch") appear in peak beats without fresh inflection. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the disallowance of 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "cautious exuberance" appears five times, "whimsically attentive" three times, "shrewd" four times, often without advancing meaning. Template cadence runs ("He frowned shrewdly… Curiosity piqued, Elias slipped… Knocking gently, he met…") and synonym churn ("uplifting," "uplift," "uplifted") across adjacent paragraphs trigger −0.6. The backstory block (lines ~25–35) stalls momentum. Figurative language ("cargo nets," "tides," "vault") is coherent but ornamental, not integral to peak beats. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack and loop check: −1.2 total in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    Phrasing is often elegant but repetitive: "luminescent ache" appears three times, "webs of kinship" five times, "boldly sympathetic/sympathetically" three times, forming a template cadence that dulls momentum (−0.6). Several beats paraphrase without added pressure: "Their steps synchronized... conversations blooming" followed immediately by "Elara shared tales... Lir spoke of his family's fracture" restates bonding twice (−0.2 paraphrase loop). Figurative density is high but coherent (marsh reeds as community veins, crater as mirror). The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("Yet the artist's mystery lingered... Dawn broke... Elara walked among them now, home") that feel like scaffolding rather than propulsion. Information density is moderate; many lines do single work. No grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure. Minor loop: "sculptures resisted" / "Sculptor's attribute waned" recycles the personification without advancing pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("ancient teeth," "skeletal fingers," "ferns," "wax under flame," "embryos of roars") and borders on overwriting in the Cradle beat, where metaphor stacks without adding causal detail. "Uncage" / "uncaged" / "caged" recurs four times in close proximity, creating noun-verb churn. No severe artifacts, but momentum sags under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "silver needles," "spells woven from dew and shadow," "fractal equations," "dovetail guides," "spectral reflections," "harmonic series," "divergent integral." Many metaphors compete without reinforcing one another; "dovetail" functions both as literal joinery and metaphor for interlocking emotions, creating vehicle confusion. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("He knelt...He unpacked...He traced...He selected..."). Paraphrase loops: "ambiguous loss" and "grief's indeterminate ache" restate the same concept adjacently. Sequence clarity suffers: "First eye slotted...He angled the wand's dovetail tongue, sliding it...A faint hum rose...Emboldened, Thorne fitted the second eye" compresses multiple steps without showing causal linkage or duration.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm modulates well between methodical cache-building and the compressed emotional turn. "Kindly methodical" recurs three times, bordering on template cadence, and "sapphire hush" appears in the opening and twice more without evolving function. The phrase "sense memory crashed over him then, unbidden and sapphire-deep" stacks modifiers and leans purple at a pivotal beat. Phrasing like "grief entombed him" and "eternal hush" add minor register drift, collectively applying −0.6 to −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "reluctant metamorphosis" / "reluctance surged," "sustaining transformation" / "sustained through transformation," "releasing control" / "release control" / "by releasing control" across multiple beats. Template cadence: "He [verb], [noun] [verb]-ing" and "Transformation [verb], [noun] [verb]" repeat without variation. Stock metaphors: "curiosity's tide," "uncoiling like roots," "verdant core." Figurative density clusters in transformation beats without paying off at closure. These artifacts dull momentum and disallow high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates purposeful rhythm and vivid imagery ("fat drops splattered," "kelp clung like war banners"), but several text artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("his endless nights painting isolation, her wanderings chasing ancestral echoes"), template cadence in the opening beats, and stock metaphor strings ("ringed with perpetual shadows," "burned with wryly earnest focus"). The phrase "wryly earnest" recurs eight times, creating a mannerism that dulls immediacy. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "glimpsed sleep's edge") cluster in peak moments. Information density is generally high, but scaffolding like "Something in their fleeting paths tugged at him" slows momentum. No loops directly obscure the closure image, capping deductions at −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed ("bright darkness" recurs; "shadows pooled like ink" then "tendrils of essence slipping like smoke"). Template cadence appears in exposition ("Each footfall elicited..."; "She spoke of..."; "The pilgrim felt...") but does not pervade. Paraphrase loop: "the unseen forces' gift" and "magnified wonders" restate the same idea in the final paragraph. Several filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "clutched") dull immediacy. Clarity is mostly intact but momentum drags in the possession sequence, which summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "compile fragments into meaning" / "piecing whispers and relics into a tapestry" / "compiled not just relics but hope" restate the same idea across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the three intervals ("First interval... Staggered pause... Second interval... Third interval") with identical syntactic stems. Mixed metaphor: "archive tower...veined with salt-crusted shelves of curated absences" conflates biological, architectural, and curatorial registers incoherently. Figurative density in the climax (spray as "silver veil," valve as "eternal fragment") ornaments rather than clarifies. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated Q7 penalties and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is extreme and uniform: "analytically artistic masterpieces," "midnight's regrets fracture into dawn's fragile resolutions," "map to his own unspoken heart." Mixed metaphors appear ("fog made solid," "crack-like filigree," "map to his own unspoken heart"). Template cadence runs across multiple beats: "He had acquired... He knew... He stepped... He swung... He settled." Paraphrase loops are present: "trembling certainty" recurs five times, "analytically artistic" twice, and the final two paragraphs restate the same closure idea. Stock phrases dominate interiority ("trembling certainty," "quivering assurance," "maps richer, certainty unshaken"). These artifacts pervade the closure beat ("perfect loop of analytical art"), triggering elevated penalties (−1.7 total in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per patterned-artifact penalty pack).

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "sympathetic skeptic… courageously kind… sculpting space" recurs verbatim across paragraphs without evolution; "courageously kind" appears four times as unearned shorthand. Stock phrases cluster in peak beats ("skepticism cracked," "symphony swelled unheard"). Figurative density in the closure paragraphs (constellation, symphony, entangled hearts) stacks without pattern-teaching. Information density is uneven—key causal beats (memories unlock, transcription happens) are summarized in single lines while atmospheric detail receives extended treatment. The read-aloud test reveals repetitive openings ("Elara," "As") and a drumbeat of declarative syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence carries stacked figurative language ("bruised violets and searing crimsons," "liquid iron," "velvet rumble," "auroral fire"), creating density without momentum. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third ("intrigue," "mutiny," "dimensional awareness" recycled). Template cadence runs appear in the climax ("walls shimmered, fracturing… dimensions clashing… escondite groaned"). Patterned-artifact penalty pack applied: −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch closure beat, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "deathly vitality," "chemical zest like overripe fruit on the edge of rot," "living mercury," "thief's signet," "cerebral tang"—figurative density in most lines of the opening third without pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphor: "rigid thinking" liquefies, yet "cons blurred into strategy, honesty into precision" mixes solidity/fluidity incoherently. Template cadence in the middle: "He twisted... releasing... A tiny scroll unrolled... The attribute struck... Eli inhaled... Suddenly, the etchings resolved..." (six sequential subject-verb openers). Paraphrase loop: "cons blurred into strategy, honesty into precision" repeats the vapor's effect in adjacent clauses. Information density is high in the breach sequence, but the opening third labors. Closure image ("ink pot clutched like talisman") is clear but relies on stock metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose carries rhythmic ambition and vivid imagery ("a verdant crown forged in miniature defiance against the sky"), but clarity suffers from stacked metaphors and mixed vehicles. "Refract" is overused and muddled: one cannot refract "the veils of time" or "truth into tangible forms" without violating the established physical logic of the lamp-hum method. Template cadence runs appear ("He pursued… He paused… He froze… Rising, he wandered…"), and synonym churn clusters around "incandescent," "restrained," "gilded," and "blooming" without added pressure. The final third repeats "hum," "texture," "blooming," and "refracted" in paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Mixed metaphor in the climax: "the hum pierced his restraint, dragging forth" conflates penetration with extraction incoherently.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "Layering this…" / "Layered atop…" / "Layering it…" recur across six beats without variation, creating a mechanical rhythm (−0.6). "Texture" and "layered" are synonym-churned throughout without fresh synonyms or embodied alternatives. The opening paragraph front-loads modifiers ("towering labyrinth," "forgotten monoliths," "fog-shrouded docks") in a purple cluster that slows momentum. Information density is low in the middle third, where fragments are collected but not advanced through choice. Clarity remains high and no causality breaks occur, preventing deeper penalty, but the prose feels over-decorated and repetitive rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose features vivid images (salt-crusted stones, dust motes in failing light, shell paint flaking) and purposeful rhythm in the cello sequence. However, template cadence pervades: multiple sentences open with "He" or "Elias" + past-tense verb, and synonym loops recur ("retold," "reimagined," "echoes," "hums" cycle without new pressure). The phrase "ephemeral compass" appears three times as a label without evolving function. Figurative language clusters densely in the climax ("groaning like waves," "shadows cheering his grim ballet," "colors blurring like memories") without clear pattern-teaching, blurring rather than clarifying the moment. Paraphrase loops in the closing paragraphs ("Myths busted anew, yet cherished" / "gloomy cheerfulness his true north") restate the same thematic claim.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "Hopeful desperation birthed a new order" echoes "hopeful desperation" five times across the text without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the second half ("Elara's attribute thrived," "Elara painted on," "Elara smiled"). Figurative language stacks at closure ("The sea whispered approval. Rafts danced eternal. And so the carnival endured.") without clear function. Key action beats (raft shuffle, yacht encounter) are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing information density. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "bridge," "tide") replace specific images. The prose reads as scaffold with minimal revision, and artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and good information density in the chemical-reaction passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "outlasted missions, probes, and the relentless vacuum" echoes "outlast" three times in adjacent paragraphs; "dawnlit melancholy" and "dawning hush" recur as labels without evolution. Stock metaphors ("frozen tear," "shadows that clawed") and elevated diction in high-pressure beats ("temporal defiance," "fractured the night") reduce immediacy. Template cadence in the timed-message sequence (vial one, vial two, vial three) reads mechanical. Deduct −0.6 for loops and stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines frame the vigil motif. Minor loops: "heartfelt" appears three times (artisan, passion, mastery); "magnetic calm" recurs without reweighting; "oversees" contradicts blindness without cost. Template-cadence slip: "Elias's motivation burned deep—to decode…not just for repair, but to honor…" reads expository. Figurative density is high ("lover's breath," "gravity," "whispered story") but mostly coherent. Paragraph structure supports the repair sequence. Final bracketed note "[Wait, but in real: adjust.]" is scaffolding; ignoring per Text Artifact Screen, but it signals generation seams.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, repetitive constructions appear in peak beats: "Harlan's pulse quickened... Harlan's subtle confidence swelled... Harlan's dry wit masked the thrill." Template cadence and paraphrase loops (e.g., "convergence" stated multiple ways across adjacent paragraphs) reduce propulsion. Mixed metaphors in "worrying tranquility... serene predator biding time" and "singular convergence crystallized" create minor figurative muddle. No severe artifacts touch closure, but accumulation lowers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn damage clarity and momentum: "ghost town" / "forsaken place" / "ghost town" recur within three paragraphs; "infinitely patient" appears four times; "wild hush" five times, often in identical syntactic slots. Template cadence runs dominate middle paragraphs ("He struck… He moved… He halted…"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle: "shadows clung like forgotten whispers," "hours bled into dusk," "balance held." These artifacts touch the closure beat ("wild hush lingered softly, wild no more"), triggering baseline −0.6, escalated to −1.0 for spread, plus −0.7 for closure contamination. Capping at 4.9 per the artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm is mostly controlled, but the piece suffers from pattern artifacts: "lonesome splendor" appears four times, "ephemeral" and "gathered hush" recur without functional variation, and elevated diction ("amassed silence harvested from drowned epochs," "spectral flower," "bearer of eternity's quiet") clusters densely across high-pressure beats, reducing clarity and momentum. Several lines paraphrase the same content—"time ran short" / "time ran shorter" / "time ebbing"—without adding pressure. The perfume vial's release and memory sequence are vivid, but adjacent sentences often restate emotional shifts in different metaphors rather than advancing causality. Propulsion slows mid-story as description accumulates without altering Lirael's options, and the final paragraph summarizes triumph rather than dramatizing the ascent's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the middle third carries figurative language ("copperlight pooled like molten repose," "hovering form coalesced," "wolfish howls made manifest") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops cluster: "hush he pursued," "chasing hush," "hush he had cultivated," "hush achieved" recur without added pressure (−0.3). Template cadence runs in parallel: "He pried… He squeezed… He pressed… He moved" (−0.4). Register drift into elevated diction ("labyrinthine bowels," "filigree") clashes with the visceral stakes (−0.3). Cumulatively −1.5 within Q7. Clarity holds, but momentum drags under ornament; the final paragraph ("In that moment, the lighthouse prison dreamed in repose") adds a metaphor after closure instead of letting the image land.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe template-cadence debt: "Over the hush" opens two paragraphs; "resonant awakening(s)" recurs six times; "ephemeral cameo" appears four times as a synonym loop for "appearance." Paraphrase loop: "She vanished…leaving behind mournful elation" / "her form ephemeral, a cameo of swirling mist and sorrowful joy." Filter-verb stacks in climax: "felt her presence," "seemed to mouth," "saw them whole." These artifacts pervade the closure sequence. Figurative density is high without payoff: "loving venom," "mournful elation," "ashen veil" repeat as labels rather than evolving images. Apply artifact penalty pack: −1.4 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.9)
    Template cadence runs throughout: "those precedents… promised… yet they crumbled," "her spirit… envisioning… where the canyon's wounds," "deeper in, somnolence claimed her; her eyes fluttered shut, body swaying." Paraphrase loops recur (the plate's "faded scene" restated as "its wanderers seeming to nod approval," the thread's color named four times without functional variation). Stock metaphor strings ("fragile bloom," "veins in the canyon's vast body," "gossamer threads") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the pull," "heard the elders' tales," "seemed to nod") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The final third is pervaded by these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering the −1.7 baseline in Q7 plus the high-band entry cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops and templated phrasing recur: "warmly curious" appears three times as a standalone beat intro; "interrupted journey" cycles through synonyms (interrupted paths, interrupted journeys, journeys interrupted); "cautious enchantment" is repeated identically in three separate beats. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to sigh," "felt the orchard's pulse") dull immediacy in the final section. Scaffold phrases ("Through purposeful wandering," "Back at the tomb, across final days") signal seams. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double work (setting + interiority) but the repeated phrase stems reduce propulsion. The artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the disallow-9+ rule globally.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-stakes beats: "a symphony of soft whirs from dormant vendor pods blending with the coo of synthetic pigeons perched on neo-classical arches" front-loads metaphor density without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("juxtaposing…against" recurs three times across paragraphs; "carefully inventive" is restated as "her carefully inventive life"). Template cadence runs: "She [verb], [object], [result]" structures dominate. Figurative language in most sentences of the chalk-drawing beat ("powdery blue promised innocence," "whispers from grandparents' attics") without escalation or cost linkage triggers the density penalty. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("a tapestry of rediscovered truths"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.8)
    Template cadence dominates: "Elara [verb], her [noun]…" and "She [verb], [participle]…" runs pervade the piece. Paraphrase loops recur: "echoed silence" appears at least four times; "adjacent possibilities" and "unheard stories" are repeated without reweighting. Filter-verb stacks ("hearing not sound but absence," "claims knowledge not available") dull immediacy. Purple prose clusters in descriptive beats ("swirling like conspirators' cloaks") without concrete propulsion. Figurative density is high but often mixed or ornamental. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: −1.4 in Q7, and the final-third presence disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.8)
    Density is high, but overwriting and template cadence weaken propulsion. "Fierce tenderness" appears six times, often as a stock phrase; "unsent letters" and "apology waited unspoken" loop without added nuance. Sentence stems repeat: "The shard [verb]," "Spirits [verb]," "She [verb]." Mixed metaphors cluster: spirits "weave" hymns, vines "claim" shores, fog "condenses" into messages—vehicles shift without coherent physical logic. Figurative saturation in nearly every sentence (especially around the heart-throne climax) blurs concrete action. Paraphrase loops: "fierce tenderness" is declared, then "fiercely tender words," then "fierce tenderness" again within three paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("bruised silvers," "lotus-hearted threnody," "quiet alchemy of understanding"). This creates rhythmic beauty but flattens propulsion in peak beats where clarity would serve better. Paraphrase loops appear: "shared anxieties" recurs across adjacent lines without added pressure; "grafted new meaning" and "lotus-hearted ache" are restated rather than advanced. Template cadence in the decryption sequence (First revelation:... Deeper still,... The final cluster...) reads mechanical. Artifact density and overwriting in closure beats trigger cumulative penalty and disallow 9+ globally per Q7 artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "pensive mirth" appears six times, "daydream" four times, "paint with light" / "painted with light" three times, "exposed film" twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [object]" structures recur across a dozen lines without variation. Stock metaphors cluster in the final third ("heart alight," "soul's fresco," "path forward, one beam at a time"). These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the -1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Tendrils of waveform flora undulated... petals vibrating... sonic sculptures" recycles the same image across three clauses; "methodically playful" appears three times without variation; "nested awakenings" is declared four times. The time-dilation paragraph—"Here, in this suspended interstice, sound waves slowed to a languid crawl, stretching seconds into eternities where thoughts bloomed like overripe echoes"—stacks metaphors that contradict (waves slow, seconds stretch, thoughts bloom, echoes overripen). Filter-verb stack in mid-section: "She gasped inwardly... she perceived... Elias watched." Stock closers: "promising endless restorations of the soul," "the garden's magic etched eternally." Artifacts touch the closure beat ("Certainty traded for wonder"), triggering the −1.7 artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.9)
    Template cadence dominates: "Elias [verb]," "Patterns [verb]," "Chaos [verb]" stems repeat across dozens of lines without purposeful pattern-teaching (apply −0.6). Paraphrase loops: "spark of defiance" → "defiance spark" → "defiance guards"; "chaos converged" → "converging chaos" → "chaos peaked" (apply −0.4). Stock metaphors pervade without transformation: "lantern light," "moth," "living warp-field." Final paragraph collapses into list-like assertions with zero propulsion. Figurative density in every line of the greenhouse sequence muddies physical choreography (apply −0.5 cumulative). Artifacts touch closure beat (apply −1.7 total in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8).

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.3)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent lines ("centuries of longing" appears seven times; "shyly unstoppable" five times; "reef-shadow joy" six times) create rhetorical drag. The final third collapses into short, repetitive fragments ("Peace blossomed. Reef-shadow joy enveloped all. Elowen dreamed on.") that recycle prior phrasing without added pressure. Template cadence dominates: repeated stems ("Centuries flashed," "Decades of," "Epochs of") and stacked modifiers ("gargantuan shell's pearlescent chambers," "bioluminescent ink," "nacreous fold") without propulsion. Metaphors are strained and contradictory ("pain's dark chlorophyll birthed galaxies of light"). Line-level artifacts pervade and touch the closure beat, warranting global 9+ disqualification and category caps per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.7)
    Ornamental phrasing pervades the text: "gently systematic" (used three times), "deserted marvels" (twice), "foxglove regret" (five times), "by the echo of a long-forgotten song" (three times as a formulaic anchor). These phrases function as template stems rather than varied specificity. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 12 ("The cracked bamboo tube sang again, its echo weaving…") and paragraph 13 ("Light flared gently systematic from the fissure…") restate the ritual described in paragraphs 11–12 with synonym churn ("sang" / "echo," "light bloomed" / "light flared"). The final two paragraphs summarize the closure ("In preserving the forgotten names, she had lit a path through her own regret") rather than dramatizing it through concrete image or action. Sentence openings across the four-wing sequence follow identical structure: "That night, as she traversed… she held the tube aloft" / "Pressing onward… Elara repeated her ritual" / "Deeper she ventured… the tube channeled light once more." Template cadence across three or more beats triggers the Q7 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and key images are vivid ("tendrils snaking toward the first knot," "shadows clung to shelves"). However, multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "carefully reckless" and "cautious exuberance" recur across beats without added pressure; "symphonies," "harmonies," "melodies" cycle in tight proximity. Template stems proliferate ("Elara's [noun]," "Thorne [verb]"). The closing meta-commentary ("Wait, recount—no, I must adjust…") breaks frame and reads as unedited scaffold. These artifacts reduce information density and dull momentum, especially in the final third where the closure should land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.7)
    Pervasive template cadence and decorative phrase repetition mar momentum: "dappled resolve" appears four times, "the building breathed" recurs as scaffold, and "slyly heartfelt" is recycled without functional variation. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third—"harmonize conflicting values" / "blend their values," "compassion encrypted" / "encrypted compassion"—triggering the −0.6 penalty for template runs. Mixed metaphors ("dappled resolve," "armored compassion," "stone lungs") reduce clarity. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere over plot. The closure beat itself remains legible, preventing deeper penalty, but line-level craft throughout lacks the precision required for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive overwriting: "blooming," "withering," "dust motes," and "paper trails" recur as verbal tics without causal pressure. Paraphrase loops: "Elias no longer needed to reinvent; his history was theirs now" is immediately followed by "Their story etched new trails." Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "One [time]" or "[Noun] [verb]ed" stems. Mixed metaphors: "feathers blooming," "laughter bloomed," "weeks bloomed," "songs blooming" dilute specificity. Stock phrasing: "Trust bloomed anew, fragile yet rooted." These artifacts pervade the ending and foreclose 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "necessary distances" repeated across seven paragraphs, "sacred thresholds" five times, "fractured hush" four times without reweighting. Template stems abound: "She drifted," "She traced," "She intuited," "She crossed." Figurative density is high in nearly every sentence ("light whispered," "distances that begged," "chaos knelt"), obscuring concrete action. The compass discovery ("twisted a chair's arm, unlocking a panel") is the clearest beat; most moves are abstract. Final-third artifacts touch the closure image, disqualifying 9+ globally per rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "shadowseam wonder," "softly ingenious," "luminous respite," and "seamless interweave" recur as stock descriptors without evolving meaning. Template cadence appears in runs like "The facility… / Elara's glove… / This object…" and paraphrase loops cluster around the feather's significance ("key to belonging," "talisman bridging," "oracle"). Mixed metaphors ("stellar harmonies like no surface landscape," "drowned mountains") muddle physical logic. Register drift into elevated diction ("cataclysmic breach," "otherworldly depths") clashes with the POV's immediacy, and the closure beat is dulled by abstraction ("rhythm at last: belonging not as possession").

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and sensory-rich, but multiple frictions accumulate. Paraphrase loops recur ("missing pieces" appears six times; "cheerful gloom" and its synonyms repeat in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure). Template cadence appears in the middle third ("One seed…Another cluster…She pieced it together"). Figurative language stacks densely in high-pressure beats ("sea-foam fingers tracing," "waves clapping in joy over submerged wrecks") without pattern-teaching, occasionally obscuring action. Stock metaphors ("frozen fireworks," "footprints in receding tides") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("acceptance's silver sigh") flatten peak moments. These artifacts touch closure beats, triggering the lower end of the artifact penalty range and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled in the opening third ("tidal arcade pulsed," "boardwalk shifted subtly"), but several template phrases repeat: "lightly attentive" appears three times, "by ordering randomness" twice, "calculated wilderness" twice. The phrase "by ordering randomness, he thought, wiping sweat from his brow—arranging chaotic elements like chess pieces" paraphrases itself within one sentence. Figurative density is high ("stars wheeling overhead in indifferent splendor") but occasionally muddy ("feral energy" doesn't land clearly). Minor filter-verb stacks ("Jasper watched, lightly attentive") and stock constructions ("eyes alight, scanning") slightly dull immediacy. Closure image (Jasper slipping away, arcade "forever subtly altered") is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.9)
    High figurative density obscures rather than sharpens: "obsidian grace," "milk-fire," "unbreakable thrall," "comet's sigh" stack without payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("exile now felt eternal" / "elective exile complete"), and template cadence runs ("she knelt," "she straightened," "she descended"). The climactic beat—inking the verse—summarizes in abstraction ("lines bloomed… cosmos etched") rather than showing hand, quill, and skin. Several beats recycle the stem "Elara + verb" without variation. The prose reads overwritten at peak moments, dulling propulsion when clarity is most needed.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the communion scene stacks figurative language ("crystal mirage," "ethereal veils aglow," "fractal dances," "noctilucent glow") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear ("reading between the lines" recurs identically in three beats; "commune/communing" is repeated without added pressure; −0.4). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The prisms," "Elias," or "He" in identical syntactic frames (−0.4). Mixed metaphors: "fog clung like a lover's breath" then "whispered secrets," conflating tactile and auditory vehicles incoherently (−0.3). These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping Q7 at 8.7 before other deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades: "hard softness" (×3), "slow dance of celestial bodies" (×2), "gently skilled" (×3), and figurative density ("silver vein," "night's hard softness," "pain etching deeper lines") clusters in high-pressure moments without clear pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear: "pain speaks to all" echoes "translate pain into a universal language" without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("stars wheeling," "cracked like fragile memories") and therapy-speak ("bargained away," "enlighten") flatten the voice. Template cadence: "He [verb]" and "Elias [verb]" dominate sentence openings across the middle third. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for density violations, loops, and stock phrasing; artifacts touch the closure beat ("binding scars to stars"), triggering the 9+ disqualification and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.9)
    Syntax varies moderately, yet figurative language saturates without pattern-teaching or payoff: "equations of hope etched into hearts like tide-polished stone," "whispers from parallel timelines bleeding through like echoes in a conch shell," "hope's new equations—hope as H = (R × F) / D" in close succession. Paraphrase loops appear: "serene upheaval" recurs five times without evolving meaning; "lucidly watchful" and "logical dreamer" are restated rather than dramatized. The closure paragraph stacks declarative summary ("people stirred," "change rippled," "had flown the trials true") instead of a single charged image. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Elara [verb]" across high-pressure beats, flattening propulsion. Mixed metaphor: hope "etched into hearts like tide-polished stone" conflates inscription with erosion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies somewhat, but several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "sensitively perceptive" recurs three times as a modifier without variation; "legacy's burden" is repeated verbatim across beats; and runs of identical sentence stems ("Elias [verb]," "The [noun]") create a drumbeat. Mixed metaphor: "burden...weighed heavier than...roof tiles" clashes with "burden lightened, transmuted" at the end. The closure beat itself ("sketching—not corridors, but atonement") is clean, so capping at the Non-closure Accumulation level. Information density is generally good, but the artifacts and loops prevent higher scoring and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-stack and template-cadence rules.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.7)
    Heavy overwriting penalty applies: "dusky harmony" appears five times, "perceptively calm" three times, "elusive" and "grace" recur as modifiers across most beats without varying function or reweighting meaning—template cadence and synonym churn trigger −0.8. Mixed metaphor: "steps rippled puddles without disturbance" contradicts itself (−0.4). Register drift into elevated diction ("transcendent grace," "borrowed heartbeat echoing forever") clashes with the lack of embodied interiority (−0.3). Paraphrase loop: paragraphs describing mirrors softening and reflecting possibilities restate without added pressure (−0.2). Total deduction ~−1.7 from a mid-5 anchor; artifacts pervade and touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "reluctant lover," "velvet sky," "flawed beauty" recur as decorative tags without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphors appear ("cracks spiderwebbing… like scars on porcelain skin" conflates spider/scar vehicles). Paraphrase loops: "operatively gentle" appears three times in identical phrasing; "flawed beauty" recurs without added meaning. Template cadence: "She was… her name… Now, in this…" runs across opening paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks dilute immediacy ("said to bind," "casting shadows that danced"). Deductions: density −0.6, coherence −0.4, loops −0.4, template −0.5; artifacts touch closure ("flawed beauty redeemed"), triggering −1.7 total and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("bruised sky," "shattered porcelain," "bone-white wasteland," "dried heart," "throat," "veil," "fracture," "cradle"), creating dense texture but dulling propulsion in high-pressure beats where clarity would serve closure better (−0.5 for density without pattern payoff). Paraphrase loops appear: "The egg, nestled deep, held possibility's breath" immediately follows "the huia's ghost winged free in his mind," restating hope without added detail (−0.2). Template cadence runs across multiple lines: "Elias Voss, shaper of wastes... The egg, nestled deep... Winds howled... Salt flats stretched... The world turned..." (−0.4). Reflection dominates the middle third without present anchors that alter his stance, flattening momentum and routing to Q7 per BRR. Cumulative artifact deductions total −1.1, and artifacts touch the closure beat ("Life, perhaps, would answer"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.7)
    Dense figurative language pervades high-pressure beats without purpose: "arms arcing like sonnets, hips swaying in haiku rhythm" muddles the action rather than clarifying it. Paraphrase loops abound ("serenity alarming," "alarming serenity"; "bodily poetic" repeated five times). Template cadence runs through the middle third: "One thread slipped free… Another echo harvested… She danced onward…" Synonym churn ("untangling," "uncoiling," "untangle," "untangling") and stock metaphors ("forgotten promises," "strings of conformity's harp") dull momentum. The final paragraph stacks summary claims instead of landing a concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "uncommonly serene" appears four times; "meteor hush" five times; "half-lit epiphanies" four times; "reverse/reversed" eight times; "seedy bars" four times. Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "Motivation purified: explore storytelling not to provoke, but to mend" immediately follows "His motivation purified." Stock metaphors accumulate: "scalpels," "ink-stained gloves," "narrative gold." These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("Uncommonly serene, he led now toward light. In every hush after storm, epiphanies waited"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("Half-lit epiphanies surged anew… What if subversion scarred more…") add −0.5. Sentence stems repeat: "The dome…" opens three consecutive paragraphs mid-story. Total deduction approximately −2.0, capping score below 5.0.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.3)
    Overwriting pervades: "verdant," "blushing stillness," "transiently rooted" recur as decorative tags rather than earned motifs. Paraphrase loops appear: "histories honored" / "overlooked histories" / "histories lived" cycle without adding pressure. Template cadence runs across the signal-building sequence: "She [verb]. The [noun] [verb]. As [event], [result]." Mixed metaphor: "ink in rosewater" clashes with "orange sails against the void." Register drift into academic diction ("geomagnetic dances," "taxonomy's indifference") in peak beats triggers −0.5; loop/scaffold debt adds −0.6; total artifact penalty −1.1 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and sensory, but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without purposeful pattern or payoff: "veins of fire," "serpent of braided hemp," "lattice of captured light," "living archive." Mixed vehicle: tears "freezing mid-fall only to thaw" contradicts the established physics of the sanctum's warmth. Paraphrase loops appear: "technically gentle" is restated three times with synonym churn ("reverence," "precision," "without snap or fray"). Template cadence in the middle section: "She approached... She unspooled... She began... She worked..." Register drift into abstract elevation ("holographic voices," "phonemes") clashes with her artisan POV. Density is high, but momentum drags under ornamental metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.6)
    The piece suffers from pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "The directive was failing, its code unraveling... pulsing erratically" immediately echoes "decaying directive" from prior lines; "Hindsight showed... Foresight unveiled" toggles mechanically; "transcended through interpreted dreams, vision blooming full" stacks synonyms without advancement. Figurative language clusters densely ("vines clawing," "clouds bruising," "paths snaked like veins") in nearly every sentence, many vehicles contradicting physical logic (wafer seals don't "snap" if translucent; communion wafers are brittle, not plastic). Register drift into academic diction ("symbiotic with souls," "catalyst") during peak beats reduces immediacy. The final third accelerates into summary ("Transcendence complete") rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "encrypted devotion" recurs six times; "empirically ironic" four times; "frugal/frugality/thrifty" eight times, often restating the same idea across adjacent lines without adding pressure. Template cadence: "Ezar [verb]" opens five sentences in close succession. Stock metaphors ("heart quickened," "smiled faintly") and elevated diction ("abyssal entity," "dusky harmony") blur into purple prose at peak beats (rift opening). Information density is low—many lines restate atmosphere or theme rather than advance situation. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops (−0.6), template cadence (−0.5), stock metaphor strings (−0.3) → baseline −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph repeats "encrypted," "frugal," "harmonious"), so escalate to −1.7. The disallow-9+ flag is raised globally.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn proliferate: "shifting reality," "reality shifted," "shifts," "shifting grace" recur without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear throughout ("Elias approached silently," "Elias leaned closer," "Elias held the music box steady," "Elias watched Thorne depart"). Figurative density in the middle section (stars wheeling, air thickening to honey, pillars sprouting vines) blurs rather than clarifies causality. The final paragraph strings scaffold: "pacifism's subtle victory etched in silence" tells rather than shows. Multiple loops and stems combine for −1.2 in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies somewhat, and spatial choreography is coherent across the ritual. However, overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "vast as a mountain face," "translucent silk and starlight," "veins of quartz," and "guardians of their recaptured world" stack figurative language without functional density. Paraphrase loops appear: "boundaries erased" is repeated across multiple lines ("erasing boundaries," "boundaries holding her at bay," "boundaries dissolved") without added information. Template cadence runs cluster in the synchronization passage: "Inhale—their chests rose… Exhale—clouds bloomed…" The final paragraph's declarative summary—"the orchard felt whole"—dulls the closure image rather than charging it.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries high figurative density in nearly every sentence ("shadowed husk," "deciduous vows," "quartz eye hummed to life," "roots starved of renewal"), creating a lyric texture that often obscures momentum in favor of ornament. Several paraphrase loops appear: the "feisty" quality is restated four times; "persist/persisting" recurs five times across the piece without meaningful variation in pressure. Template cadence is visible in the middle section ("Elias held out… / Lila scoffed… / Using the forgotten bag's contents…"), and the storm-repair sequence accelerates but then deflates with exposition ("not grand prophecies, but intimate truths—how her mother's wisdom…"). Clarity remains high, but information density is diluted by decorative phrasing and synonym churn on key terms.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "brightened disquiet" recurs at least seven times without evolving meaning; "simply complicated" appears four times as a label; "between first and last page" is repeated without added pressure. Template cadence runs in adjacent sentences ("Elara had inherited... Bewilderment creased... Determined, Elara stepped..."). Stock metaphors ("blossoming astrally," "temporal waves") stack without fresh vehicle logic. Filter verbs ("saw," "understood," "pondered") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-motivated necessity. These artifacts dull momentum and obscure causal linkage, particularly in the closure sequence. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.2 baseline for loops, template stems, and filter stacks; escalated to −1.4 because artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.6)
    Severe template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Carefully resourceful" appears twice in identical syntactic position; "unheard symphony" recurs as empty motif without reweighting. Mixed metaphors pervade: bookstore has "roots," "vaulted stacks," characters "plunge into the maze," but spatial logic never coheres. The bracketed generation artifacts ("[Adjusting flow.] ... [Word check internal.] [Final tally: precisely woven.]") are scaffolding that should have been cut and disqualify any 9+ consideration globally. Synonym churn: "clutched a tattered botanical diary" → "the diary's plants" → "botanical bridges" → "the diary's pages now alive with promise." Information density is low—long stretches describe atmosphere without advancing situation. Purple prose peaks in crisis: "swirling mist," "cascade of golden light," "triumphant silence."

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy reliance on repeated abstract phrases: "unkindled solace" (five times), "blissfully aberrant" (four times), "trapped freedom" (four times) creates a template cadence that dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops are visible ("Memories began to alter" / "Memories altered further" / "Memories altered wildly now"). Mixed metaphors: "fog sealed every horizon" vs. "fog reclaimed the ship." Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, stock metaphor strings, and phrase recycling across beats. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate tone rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clear and image-rich, with strong specificity in objects (wax seal, braided rope, faded tomes). However, paraphrase loops appear ("The confusion swirled… Clarity demanded action"; "merge action pulsed… fables' pages fluttered, absences filling with clarity"), and the final ~80 words ("Wait, precision… Actually, final seal… No, adherence strict… Wait, recount needed?") are unrevised scaffold that obscures the closure image with meta-chatter. These artifacts in the final third trigger deductions and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, but suffers from significant pattern debt. "Hammered repose" appears four times, "gently luminous" three times, "bloom of hush" recurs throughout—repetition that reads as scaffolding rather than taught motif. Adjacent sentences paraphrase: "The stone's gentle luminosity intensified, bathing the ice in ethereal blue. Cracks pulsed in sympathy, ripple-marks awakening as if tides returned"—both describe the same visual escalation. Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" stems in the climax without variation. These artifacts cluster in the closure section, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.0 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally; cap high-band at 8.8). Figurative language ("petals of hush unfurling like frost flowers") is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is moderate; some beats advance multiple jobs (stone + cracks + bloom), but the final third loops through the same image set.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She knew then" / "Nights blurred" / "She descended"; "the beacon roared alive, its pillar piercing" / "the pavilion hummed louder, a song of persistence." Stock metaphors ("doubt gnawed," "hope stirred," "seeds scattering on hopeful winds") and decorative modifiers ("dust-choked dawn," "thistle-blown hope") replace concrete action. The line "Coincidences had meaning; the stars proved it" in the penultimate paragraph is a thesis statement that flattens the closure image. Apply baseline −1.0 for loops and cadence; artifacts touch closure so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.7)
    Template cadence pervades the middle: "She traced… / She moved… / She rose…" across four consecutive beats, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear ("conjecture crystallized" / "conjectures, identity sharper" / "sealed her conjectures") and conceptual redundancy between "sculpt identity from experience" and "identity sculpted" in the final third adds −0.3. Stock metaphors ("frost on glass," "dying breath," "quill poised") cluster without fresh vehicle logic. Information density is low; several sentences restate the same thematic claim. Clarity remains high and no grammatical errors appear, preventing further drop.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clear and maintains momentum through most beats, but paraphrase loops appear: "hopelessness clung like damp fog" restated as "hopelessness recoiled" without added pressure; "blooming fortress" recurs six times with synonym churn ("blooms pulsing," "blooms nodded," "fortress bloomed fiercer"). Template cadence runs in the chant lines and several "he [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Mixed metaphor: "Filter the gloom, reveal the gleam" pairs a physical verb with an abstract noun awkwardly. The final third carries these patterns into the closure sequence, disqualifying 9+ and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery (cicada's emerald wings, ripples warping the form). However, figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated description—without teaching a pattern or serving peak pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "not in sharp prophecy, but in textured impressions" restates the tangential method already shown. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("transition had found its chronicler, time its texture") that dilute propulsion. No major artifacts obscure causality, but density and thematic echo lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is image-rich and propulsive through the inversion sequence. The fragmentary ending creates visual rhythm and cadence shift, signaling resolution through compression. However, synonym loops appear ("silences" recurs 14 times, "stretched/stretching/contracted" paraphrased across multiple lines) and template stems ("She'd…" "Her…") cluster in the final third. Mixed metaphor: "stretched the contracted fear into open sky" conflates spatial and temporal logic. The gilded-hush beat is vivid, but line-level repetition and near-paraphrase ("flavor like honeyed velvet, thick and regal… tasting of opulent peace") dull density.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "drifting prism terrace suspended itself in vaulting hush" and "threading comfort through the air" stack metaphors without clarity. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("Elias did not scold; instead, he catalyzed..."). Paraphrase loops appear ("silence learns," "teach silence," "silence wiser") without added pressure. Mixed metaphors ("storm glass veins of predicted turmoil," "words trailed into muffled puffs") blur physical logic. Artifacts touch the closure image ("silence wiser, ready"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.4)
    Loops and scaffold pervade: "slathered in layers of iridescent paint—camouflage from scavengers, peeling faintly" then "the paint to bubble and slough away like molting skin" then "Through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals" restates the same event across three beats (−0.6). Stock metaphor strings ("heartbeat from yesteryear," "whispered windsongs from centuries past," "molting skin," "shattering rainbows") cluster without earned specificity (−0.5). Template cadence runs: "Clutching… activated… slipped," "Parting… stepped… into" (−0.4). Figurative density in most sentences of the orchard and pavilion beats without payoff at closure (−0.5). Cumulative artifact penalty −2.0; since artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("communing," "weave," "beckoning"), the 9+ global disallow applies and high-band entries cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.9)
    The piece exhibits high figurative density without pattern-teaching: nearly every sentence in the middle third deploys metaphor ("vines of dependency strangling," "false bellows inflating," "gossamer," "ironweed"), obscuring concrete action. Paraphrase loops appear ("shadows whispered warnings, tender under his care" / "tender shadow keeper...shadows curling content") and template cadence runs with "He [verb]" stems across multiple beats. Mixed vehicles occur ("vines...draw air unaided" conflates botanical and respiratory metaphors). Stock phrasing ("loaded emptiness," "harder freedoms") and filter-verb stacks ("he saw," "he felt," "he knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate, but momentum drags under ornamental layering. The closure beat itself (ring heated, threshold stabilized) is clearer, limiting global harm.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language ("shadows woven from forgotten dreams," "spores whispering secrets," "mycelial networks mimicked neural webs") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "pressure built—not just physical, but conceptual: the pyramid scheme's crushing deceit manifesting as palpable force" restates the same idea across two clauses. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "He [verb]" or "Elias [verb]" without variation. Stock metaphors cluster: "liquid starfire," "inner universes," "eternal, wondrous shadow." The final third accumulates scaffold ("The end? Merely a facet in the grand refraction") and thematic summary that flattens momentum. Line-level artifacts touch the closure zone, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe line-level debt. Phrase recycling is pervasive: "eloquently silent" appears five times, "golden shadows" four times, "musing" / "mused" six times, "bridge of intuition" three times, often in adjacent or near-adjacent paragraphs without reweighting. Template cadence runs throughout the middle third ("He closed his eyes, musing…" / "Elias mused…" / "he would muse again"). Stock metaphors ("threads in a fraying tapestry," "light over abyss") and register drift into archaic diction ("sanctum," "perfidy," "scepter of reckoning") clash with the modern premise. Paraphrase loops cluster in the final quarter: "The reading room endured, eloquently silent" / "its silence now truly eloquent" within two paragraphs. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the elevated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with figurative language and elevated diction that often obscures rather than advances: "factually mystical" (repeated four times) is a contradiction dressed as world logic, "shivering bliss" recurs without evolving meaning, and lines like "air thickening like molten glass, stars fracturing into prismatic shards" stack modifiers that blur the image. Paraphrase loops appear: "withdrawn by nature" and "withdrawn reserve" restate the same trait; "capture the shape of possibility" is echoed in "seized not just shapes, but the shivering bliss of mastery over what might be." Template cadence runs through multiple beats ("He had come here…driven by"; "Kneeling amid…he uncovered"; "Whispering into…Elowen's voice wove"). The closure beat is touched by artifact density—"shivering bliss of mastery" recycles prior phrasing instead of landing a fresh image. Sentence openings vary minimally, and scaffolding phrases ("As reality shifts began," "The program, relic of") read as boilerplate transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is generally strong, with vivid images like "dust motes dancing in slivers of afternoon sun" and "eagle seeming to gaze back with steadfast promise." However, line-level artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("unknown histories" repeated across paragraphs), template cadence in the final third (eight consecutive "she [verb]" constructions), and figurative density that occasionally overreaches ("her broken heart, though scarred, now beat with purpose renewed"). The scaffold sentences in the ending ("Tucking the artifacts safely away, she locked the box, her steps lighter...") summarize rather than propel. Apply −0.8 for distinct loop and cadence issues touching the closure section.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.9)
    The piece suffers from pervasive overwriting: "sun bled orange into gutters," "velvet sky," "ghosts of the resistance," "freedom's code pulsed" stack metaphors without clear vehicles or causal links. Template cadence runs appear ("Plans had unraveled… cells shattered… Elias's careful resourcefulness shone") and the final third devolves into paraphrase loops—"true history reappeared, defiant and alive" restates "revised histories" without adding pressure. Stock phrases ("heart pounding," "fingers trembling," "smiled faintly") replace specific gestures. The closure beat is particularly cluttered: "The auric glow lingered in his eyes, a promise etched eternal. Freedom, coded deep, would not be revised away" layers abstractions that obscure rather than sharpen the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "dewdrops formed," "quietly vivid," "eerie," "nostalgic," and "vested hush" recur without causal advance. Runs of identical stems ("The prophecy fought back… The prophecy persisted… prophecy's echoes fracturing") across multiple sentences. Stock metaphors ("tendrils curling," "pregnant silence," "brittle ice") stack without fresh specificity. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (climax paragraph) blurs momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("watching," "lingering") dull immediacy. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for spread and touch at closure; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "hush where past meets prophecy" is restated three times with slight variation; "mossy delight" appears six times without functional reweighting; adjacent sentences repeat content ("The speck quivered, then cracked open" followed by "From within emerged transformed always" summarizes the same moment). Template cadence runs dominate ("To decode, one must..."; "Each structure... served as..."; "Past meets prophecy in the hush..."). Figurative language is dense but mixed ("fingers dancing," "heart burned like bioluminescent fungi," "veins glowing like prophecy's own script"), and elevated diction ("ashen skyborne arbor," "bioluminescent fungi," "iridescent") clashes with the task-focused POV. These artifacts appear throughout, including in the closure beat, triggering −1.7 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is largely clean with purposeful figurative language ("mist… like forgotten thoughts," "ash"). Two noticeable issues: the phrase "uncertainly certain" and its variants appear four times, creating a template cadence loop around the core concept; the sentence "He embodied uncertainty certainly, convinced that with precise planning…" tangles its own syntax. No major paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the recurrence of the coined phrase in peak beats (opening, mid-point, climax) triggers the template-cadence penalty (−0.4 to −0.6 in Q7). Information density is high; momentum is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "luminous regret," "golden resolve," "factually mystical silver," "verifiable astral force," and mixed metaphors ("stars pulling flesh into ether," "seams veining like captured lightning"). Template cadence runs through the ritual sequence (five consecutive "She [verb]" stems). Paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of names" recurs four times with near-identical phrasing, and "luminous" appears seven times. The final third carries stock phrases ("rain-washed solitude," "cathedral of their redemption") that dull the closure image. Artifacts touch the ending: apply −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.2)
    Severe overwriting in high-pressure beats: figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("tears on stone," "shattered glass," "giggles choked by thorns," "thorns," "tumble of invisible pies," "banana peels"), creating density without proportionate clarity or propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("confessions rippled outward... confessions intensifying... Another confession burst forth"), and template cadence runs flatten rhythm ("She pursued... pursuing... pursued relentlessly"). The phrase "luminous ache" recurs five times without functional reweighting, becoming ornamental. Mixed metaphors strain coherence: "luminous ache" (light + pain) and "spectral fingers" (ghost touch) blur rather than sharpen. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("luminous ache" in the final paragraph), triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "anesthesia ebbed like a receding tide," "world ablaze in invisible fire," "sins etched in flesh," "compass for memory," etc. (−0.6 for figurative density). Paraphrase loops: "braced against a throbbing trunk" / "Elara braced harder" / "brace anew" / "Bracing fully" / "bracing one last time" recycles the same physical act without advancing pressure (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("invisible fire," "lover's scars") and register drift into academic jargon ("proprioceptively," "fractal convergence") clash with urgent scene needs (−0.3). Cumulative artifact penalty touches the closure beat ("bracing one last time"), so −1.3 total and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "elusively tangible" appears three times; "overlooked histories" / "silenced tales" / "forgotten lore" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence dominates peak beats: "She traded… She felt… The fragment became… Years blurred… She aided…" Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("she clutched," "she yearned," "she sensed"). Stock metaphors appear without fresh angle ("jeweled spiderwebs," "tapestries of dreamstuff"). Figurative density in the climax ("visions cascaded," "power unbound," "tales etching into every onlooker's soul") abstracts rather than grounds. Applying patterned-artifact penalty (−1.2) for loops, template cadence, and stock strings; artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though several lines loop or paraphrase: "ghosts he saw were his true companions—a weightless burden that clung without weighing him down" restates the same idea; "thick, undisturbed drifts by the walls, but swirling eddies near the center" could compress further. The vision paragraph summarizes backstory ("the watchmaker ticket seller, obsessed with time's precision, had rigged…") where dramatization would sharpen pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "façade begging to crack" and "unraveling wire" work, though "distant popcorn dreams" borders on decorative. Minor filter-verb reliance ("his eyes tracing," "his gaze fixed") in mid-pressure beats. No major loops or scaffold, but the piece could tighten by ~50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple patterned artifacts cluster in peak beats: paraphrase loops ("compressed eternity," "rustling awakenings" repeated without added pressure), template cadence in the final fragment sequence, and stock metaphor strings ("eternity's cork," "bottled forever"). The final third's staccato fragments ("Rupture inevitable. Awakenings rustled forth.") are taught but border on ornamental churn rather than propulsive clarity. Information density is uneven—many lines restate the same metaphysical claim. Figurative language is dense without coherent vehicle logic ("whispers erupted in a bottled tempest" mixes liquid and wind). Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, metaphor muddle −0.4; total −1.5 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, plus baseline artifact spread touching closure drops eligibility for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("frozen screams," "rivers frothing into emerald whirlpools," "revolutionary ghosts"), often occupying most sentences in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff—triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "shard's allure pierce his sorrow" / "visions flooding" / "shard clutched like a broken heart" restate emotional charge without added pressure. Template cadence in the planning passage ("procuring… timing… draping… slipping") flattens propulsion. Several stock metaphors ("like a specter," "like a broken heart") and filter verbs ("felt the shard's allure pierce") dull immediacy at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening third stacks metaphor or elevated modifier ("tinkersong wonder," "vengeful bloom," "imprisoned starlight"), creating density without propulsion (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "The covenant of rust demands truth" is restated multiple times across the text (−0.2). Template cadence: "Elias [verb]" stems recur across six consecutive sentences mid-story (−0.5). Register drift into alchemical/poetic diction clashes with the repairman's POV in high-pressure beats (−0.4). Information density is low—many lines restate atmosphere without advancing causality. Cumulative line-level debt disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence in the lagoon beat carries figurative language ("mirror of obsidian," "gothic hush," "frozen waves," "metallic tang") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops pervade: "resonant hush" appears eight times; "hinged" recurs mechanically as stem in adjacent lines; "delve/delving/delved" cycles without added meaning. Template cadence runs from "Elara [verb]" structure across multiple beats (−0.5). The final third staccato ("She was home. But wait, deeper callings lingered.") contradicts prior rhythmic mode and obscures closure (−0.8 total for artifacts touching closure). Register drift into abstract diction ("communion," "translucent," "quiescent") clashes with POV lexicon (−0.4). Total artifact penalty −1.7 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per rule.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive text artifacts: "perpetually learning" loops across six paragraphs, "turbine-hum reverie" recurs four times, and "reimagine" appears nine times without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence runs proliferate ("Layer upon layer, she carved... Emboldened, Elara placed... Together in this reverie, they scaffolded..."). Paraphrase loops are evident: "using the slide's glow as her scaffold" / "scaffolded escape with simplicity" / "simplicity's scaffold had bound her." Stock metaphors ("temporal complexity," "essence," "infinities untold") replace concrete action. Baseline −1.2 in Q7 for loops and cadence runs; additionally disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.6)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn stall momentum: "quietly driven" appears in three separate beats with no added pressure; "umbral tenderness" is restated as "tender ache in the umbral half-light" and "Umbral tenderness swelled"; "dawning hush" recurs four times as a thematic label without causal work. Template cadence runs dominate the final third ("Elara rose… Elara stepped… Elara sealed… Elara breathed"), triggering −0.6 for stem repetition. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (final glass discovery, tears, masterpiece declaration) without pattern-teaching or payoff: "vivid swirls," "defiant splendor," "haunted her dreams," "lover's whispered secret," "forgotten promises," "impatient fingers"—register drift and stock metaphor strings together warrant −0.8. Combined artifact penalties and the final-third contamination disqualify 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("tension coiling like heat haze," "wind-wraiths," "searing pull," "spectral pulse"), and much of it lands cleanly, but runs of template cadence appear: "The guardians hovered… The guardians nodded," "Elias's fingers… Elias's heart… Elias absorbed," triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines ("truths long buried" / "truths he sought" / "truths forever veiled" / "broadcast these truths") add −0.3. Label-heavy interiority ("solemn duty," "motivation realized") and therapy-speak ("unresolved grievances") in peak beats add −0.4. Total artifact penalty: −1.3 in Q7, and the final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence dominates: "He conceived… He reimagined… He rejected… Elias stood… Elias melted…" across a dozen sentences. Paraphrase loops recur: "conceive" / "conceived" / "conception," "reimagine" / "reimagined" / "reinvention" cycle without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("unquenched fire," "mental crucible") and abstract nominalization ("collective spirit," "essences") flatten texture. Figurative language clusters in the middle third without coherent vehicle logic: the mind is "uncorked like a volatile elixir," yet also a "forge" and a "crucible." The Text-Artifact penalty pack applies: template runs (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.4), stock metaphor strings (−0.3), totaling −1.3 baseline in Q7, escalated to −1.5 because artifacts touch the closure beat ("a legacy reimagined").

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting saturates peak beats: "velvet disquiet enveloped him fully now, the prophecy's chill seeping into his bones" stacks metaphors without clarifying embodied state; "serendipitous marriage of relic, memory, and rite" elevates diction beyond necessity. Paraphrase loops appear ("immerse it, coaxing forth the buried sentiments it held captive" / "immersion demanded more than water") and template cadence runs recur ("Elias's breath caught…"; "Elias transcribed feverishly…"; "Elias froze…"). Information density is moderate—many sentences describe atmosphere rather than advancing plot or character—and the final third retains ornamental phrasing ("trapped emotions," "sealing his fate") that dilutes closure sharpness. No severe artifacts touch the final image, preventing heavier penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence stacks metaphor or oxymoron ("furiously tranquil," "wild serenity," "serene fury," "gritty silk"), triggering density and register penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "furiously tranquil" recurs three times without added meaning; "borrowed time" and "entropy" cycle through synonym variants (decay, dissolution, disorder molecules). Template cadence is present in the chant sequence: "She positioned… she began… she placed… she poured…" across four consecutive sentences. Line-level clarity survives but propulsion is sluggish. Final image ("ready to save not just seeds, but eternities") abstracts rather than concretizes. Aggregate artifacts in peak beats warrant −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops severely undermine momentum: "Elias, the humble storm siren tester, embodied a credibly curious spirit" / "credibly curious, he cross-referenced his logs"; "zero hour loomed: midnight" / "zero hour approached; his pocket watch ticked toward twelve" / "As the watch struck midnight—zero hour"; "No longer just a tester, Elias was guardian" / "Credibly curious to the end, he pulled the rope once more." Synonym churn ("hush," "sanctuary," "windblown," "microclimate variations") recurs without added pressure. The final third is especially scaffolded: "Years on, his logs proved prophetic" / "The glue-dried switch became lore" / "Above the clouds, the windblown sanctuary whispered on" stack summary statements that replay prior material. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same content (the switch is mended, the bell is preferred, listening is favored) across multiple beats. The artifactual loops and register drift into poetic abstraction in peak beats trigger cumulative penalties and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6 for density). Multiple metaphors clash or overreach: "shadow given form," "vein of liquid sunlight," "blooming brightest in vulnerability's hush." Paraphrase loops recur: paragraphs restating that stars flourish in surrender without adding pressure (−0.3). Template cadence: repeated "he + past-tense verb" stems across six consecutive sentences mid-story (−0.5). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("vulnerable, yet eternal"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Total deductions approach −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops ("astonishment shattered his solitude… eyes widening in rare astonishment"; "mute eloquence… silence eloquent testament"), synonym churn on "gaze" (×8 in functional roles), and template cadence runs ("The recluse [verb]… The recluse [verb]…") accumulate across the text. Stock metaphors ("weight of unspoken words," "threads on a loom") and filter-verb stacks ("seeing ghost-veils," "gazing at stars") dull immediacy in peak beats. The closure paragraph ("silence bloomed eternal. The weight held, unspoken, unbreakable") leans on abstraction rather than concrete image. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 deduction and the global 9+ disallowance and 8.8 cap across categories per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("emerald-veined walls," "verdant glows," "fibrous grain," "plush weight of unspoken regrets") and synonym churn ("notched," "etched," "groaning," "shiver," "rippled," "pulsed") dull propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "borrowed time felt thinner" / "No longer just surviving on borrowed time" and "timeless" repeated across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "his pulse quickened—borrowed time felt thinner—as he descended" / "suddenly timeless, the porcelain ceased its subtle decay" / "visions unspooled—not memories, but time's raw weave." Figurative density in the closure paragraphs obscures cause/effect; the final notch lacks concrete consequence. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe overwriting pervades high-density beats: "burnished hush," "cobalt lagoon," "warmly attentive," and "by harmonizing discord" recur as template phrases without variation. Mixed metaphors appear ("woven dawns," "threads interlaced," "celestial loom") that layer without clarifying. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "He murmured lines to himself" is followed by "It was his ritual, launching thoughts skyward." Stock poetic diction ("whispered secrets," "captured breaths") replaces concrete action. Filter-verb stacks ("watching the kite catch air," "feeling the quiet pulse") dull immediacy in peak beats, triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Gently systematic, he began at first light" is echoed by "No rush marred his calm; each measurement was a meditation, brazen in its certainty," then "No force, just gentle pressure, systematic loops." Trait labels recur as sentence stems across the text. Stock metaphors ("stone in still water," "living stone," "roots spoke before words") accumulate without transformation. The final third contains summary montage ("Months passed in his mind's eye") and thematic summary ("Architectural secrets now sung aloud") that stall closure. Filter-verb stacks and abstract nominalization ("motivation burned clear," "respect bloomed") dull immediacy. Multiple paraphrase pairs appear: "brazen calm" / "brazen calm unbroken" / "brazen calm eternal"; "interspecies respect" recurs five times without variation. Baseline artifacts across beats trigger −1.4; closure-adjacent summary adds −0.3 for a net around −1.7 in this category, disallowing 9+ globally and capping entries near 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every beat: "bronze quiet spring," "petals clung like forgotten whispers," "luminous skepticism," "chemistry of homecoming," "bronze-quiet against the patter." In high-pressure moments (tower entry, amber activation), the density does not ease, creating a uniformly elevated tone that dulls propulsion. Template cadence appears in paired constructions: "No divine quest, this pilgrimage was engineered"; "not for conquest, but comprehension"; "not home, but to new orbits." Paraphrase loops: "bronze quiet" recurs four times; "luminous" seven times without reweighting. Filter-verb stacks ("sensed," "seemed," "felt") and passive constructions cluster in middle beats. Apply −0.8 for density without pattern payoff, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for loops touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally clean, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The reef had died years ago…Now, after the reef dies" restates the same fact; "narrow vastness" is defined twice in adjacent paragraphs; "blooming" modifies jetty, boards, and edge within four paragraphs. Template cadence runs ("He withdrew…Crushing…Guided…At the indicated spots") in the scattering sequence flatten propulsion. Stock metaphors ("desperate finger tracing infinity," "garden's quiet conquest") and elevated diction in the closure paragraph ("tendrils weaving," "slaughter's legacy into life's tapestry") drift into generic lyricism. These artifacts cluster in the final third, applying the tightened artifact penalty (−0.6 to −0.8 in Q7) and disallowing 9+ globally per the cap rule.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.1)
    Figurative density is extreme and uniform: "wild hush" appears nine times, "tinted" eight, "intuitively descriptive" thrice—pattern-taught but overworked, dulling impact. Runs of identical syntactic stems ("He [verb], noun [verb]") and paraphrase loops ("distance alchemized to pulse-sync" after "translate distance into closeness") create scaffold drag. Mixed metaphors: "breath a dry gale," "settlement's core hush," "moth-eaten memories" lack coherent vehicle logic. Template cadence in the final third (micro-paragraphs of 1–2 lines, each echoing "wild hush" or "tinted") flattens propulsion. Applying overwriting and loop penalties: −0.8 for density without payoff, −0.6 for paraphrase cycles, −0.4 for template cadence touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy text-artifact debt: the final third loops through paraphrase ("Blessed pariah no more, explorer eternal. True north called again. She followed.") and template cadence runs ("Temporal echoes faded. Exploration infinite. Silence, her companion..."). Stock metaphors ("stars witnessed all") and the phrase "echoed silence" recurs seven times without evolving function. The pivot beat—sketch revealing the rift—is told in summary ("the sketch revealed patterns") rather than shown, and the final staccato fragments ("Gilded rose spun true. Blessed paths ahead. Stars witnessed all.") read as padding rather than purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is largely clear but suffers from repeated template cadence and paraphrase loops: "sacredly playful" appears four times, "cautious abandon" twice, and many sentences follow identical stems ("Elarion's X," "The Y," "No mere…"). High-pressure beats (visions, swap, shatter) are cluttered with decorative modifiers ("auroral sparks," "ethereal grooves," "bloated with void-secrets") that slow propulsion rather than sharpen it. The final third stacks exposition and summary ("villages would wake to mended skies, debts of fate quietly paid") instead of dramatizing consequence, and several lines paraphrase prior content without adding detail or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is ambitious and figurative, but density tips into overwriting: "luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra," "susurrus" recur frequently without added pressure, and metaphors sometimes layer without clarifying ("glow that revealed nothing," "partial eclipse...luminous in its evasion"). Template cadence appears in several beats ("First, he paced...Next...'tilt'...Next, 'Clench'"), creating a ritualistic rhythm that risks monotony (−0.5). Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the piece carries scaffold phrases ("benevolently ruthless" repeated, "luminous absence" anchoring multiple beats without evolution). Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (setting and action), but others ornament without advancing stakes. Clarity holds, but propulsion slows under the weight of decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dense figurative language pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, harming clarity and momentum (e.g., "mercury-silver flooded her eyes, unburying talents in a rush of thunderous clarity"). Multiple metaphors in quick succession create conceptual muddle: "memories surged—not as pain, but refracted" followed immediately by "home's shape emerged." Paraphrase loops are present: the stone "substitutes reality nightly" is restated as "the stone's attribute wove illusions that overlaid her sleep." Template cadence runs in the middle section ("Tracing it, she seeded… revealing… understanding"). Information density is high but propulsion is sluggish due to ornamental layering.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and carries vivid figurative language, but density and momentum suffer from paraphrase loops and decorative phrasing. "Woven hush" appears four times in varied constructions without added pressure; "fidgeting productively" is repeated mechanically; and several sentences restate content ("He winnowed ruthlessly, discarding illusory paths" / "One by one, frayed secrets yielded"). Stock metaphors ("labyrinth as chessboard," "threads as forgotten moves") cluster densely in high-pressure beats, and template cadence runs appear in the middle section ("Each thread bore...," "To winnow meant...," "He traced..."). The final paragraph lists metaphorical moves rather than dramatizing a choice, dulling the closure image's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is dense with figurative language ("bruised sky," "forgotten spines," "spectral halos," "prismatic words," "symphony of doubt") in nearly every sentence, creating register drift and slowing momentum without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Paraphrase loops appear: "The price of forgiveness" is restated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence is evident in repeated "[Elara] + [past-tense verb]" stems across paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("storm in her eyes," "silken hook," "fire tempered by hush") reduce specificity. These artifacts pervade the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.7)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Another pockmark… he matched it… narrated… surged… quilted" repeats five times with only synonym substitution. Stock metaphors cluster without coherent vehicles (quilting memories, kintsugi veining, spidering, tapestry, legacy). Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("The charm clicked… His mind quilted… Memories quilted anew") add −0.5. Figurative density in most sentences (golden resolve, dire enchantment, quilted solitude) without pattern payoff triggers −0.6. Artifact penalties total −1.7 and touch the closure beat ("quilting oblivion into legacy"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content (e.g., paragraphs 6–7 paraphrase the first pockmark match three times).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is lyric and image-rich, with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm ("The caves beckoned as they always had, a labyrinth of dripping stone carved by relentless tides, their mouths yawning darkly under the cliffs"). However, several beats lean into ornamental description that stalls momentum: "fern fronds draped like emerald curtains, wild orchids bloomed in defiant color" piles texture without advancing pressure. Synonym loops appear in the middle third ("luminous lagoon" / "crystal spring" / "pool's edge" cluster within two paragraphs). The phrase "intimately aloof" is used twice—once as character summary, once as a thesis turn—without dramatized payoff. Figurative density is high throughout ("dying stars," "captured memories," "bubble of forever"), and while consistent with the painterly lens, it occasionally blurs propulsion in the cave descent. No clarity-breaking artifacts, but the final paragraph's thematic summary ("to reveal the truth of nostalgia, not as endless ache, but as cherished illusion") reads as scaffold rather than earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear across the text: "screaming tenderness" is repeated verbatim three times without reweighting; "vibrations of intent" appears four times in similar phrasing. The final third stacks filter verbs ("he felt," "he believed," "he waited") and delivers explanatory summary ("proving his point as she climbed") instead of showing. Mixed metaphors cluster in peak beats: "ripple finer than sea foam, infused with... perfume" conflates liquid and vapor without coherent vehicle. These artifacts touch the closure unit, flattening propulsion where it should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance setting, action, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats during calls, longer paragraphs during reflection). Paraphrase loops appear: "raw solace" recurs without evolution; "patchwork" (navigator, life, body) is synonym-churned across early paragraphs; "geography of loss" and "loss's geography" toggle without added meaning. Template cadence in construction beats: "He scavenged... lashing... under starlight" and "wound the coils... align to the censer's hum" read formulaic. Figurative density ("stars wheeled," "foxfire," "threads") is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "piecing worlds from loss's threads" conflates weaving and cartography awkwardly. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is dense with figurative language in nearly every sentence ("defiant prayers," "fractured grace," "veritas nerve," "mycelium rumored to bridge relic and flesh"), creating a pattern of elevated diction that dulls propulsion in high-pressure beats. The ritual sequence—"disinfected…anointed…pressed"—is clear but surrounded by ornamental phrasing that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "psychological safety demanded sacrifice" is restated as "cultivating the safety he'd chased." Mixed metaphors ("storm-trapped moon," "veritas nerve") and stock constructions ("winds howled elegies") reduce clarity. The artifact density is pervasive and touches the closure beat ("fractured but unbroken," "whole in his duality"), triggering the lower artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    Overwriting is pervasive in high-pressure beats: "silhouette frayed at the edges," "dock's opal sheen now smeared with seawater," "borrowed memories bloomed unbidden," "looping like fog-bound echoes." Figurative density without pattern-teaching triggers −0.5. Paraphrase loop: "softly persistent" appears four times, violating economy (−0.3). Template cadence in the investigation sequence: "Gap one… Gap two… Flash… Gap two" (−0.4). Stock metaphor: "memories intertwined, no longer borrowed but owned" (−0.2). Cumulative artifact penalty in Q7 totals −1.4. Information density is high where not looped; the final image propels cleanly. Clarity holds despite texture, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting and scaffold bloat flatten momentum: "testament to paths untaken, fueling his isolation"; "the creek's rise now a rhythmic underscore to renewal"; "its secrets spent." Paraphrase loops recur ("loneliness ebbed; maps now shared stories, not just sold solitude" restates the prior transformation claim). Figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats ("living compass," "hymn to decisions embraced") without pattern-teaching, violating the overwriting check. Template cadence appears in the final section with repetitive conceptual closures across four consecutive summary sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose carries consistent ornament ("ghost of royal splendor," "seductive peril," "prophetic lace") but accumulates scaffold loops: "softly commanding" recurs as label, "bleeding starlight" is paraphrased across multiple beats without advancing pressure, and the final paragraph stacks synonym variants ("thorns hidden in petals," "deceptive delicacy"). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Higher they pressed... The ridge emerged... Breath ragged, they hauled..." follows identical [action] then [state] stems. Figurative density in peak beats (grotto climax) muddles clarity: "lacy menace," "silvery rivulets," "prophetic lace," "noose of glowing threads" within six lines without pattern-teaching or payoff. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs, −0.4 for figurative clutter in the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "density of presence" appears five times; "directed spontaneity," "scientifically romantic," and "revalue" recur as label clusters without new information. Runs of parallel stems ("Lirien nodded... Lirien pocketed... Lirien smiled") and synonym churn ("essence," "conviction," "palette," "hues") dull momentum. Mixed metaphors appear ("honeyed amber" density, "blade's edge" focus). Figurative density in nearly every sentence—"fractalized time," "veiling allies," "ember nexus sighed"—obscures cause without pattern payoff. Filter-verb stacks ("she whispered," "she breathed," "she said") cluster in the peak beat, further flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high and often vivid ("cabin's skeletal embrace," "arrow of light"), but several metaphors cluster without clear pattern-teaching: "cabin walls blurred," "splintering timber in a cascade of starlit shards," "winds howled with the voices of past selves." Template cadence runs appear ("I remembered… I hated… I chased… I twisted… I landed") without variation in sentence openings across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops touch the middle third: "Jealousy gnawed… The envy deepened… Jealous no more, but envious still." Combined artifacts in peak beats trigger −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense ("mist clinging...like a hesitant whisper," "water residue gleamed like unshed tears," "scratches like frantic scratches on a delivery room door") and often mixed or redundant, reducing clarity without pattern-teaching payoff. Template cadence runs through the Miriam flashback ("One fog-shrouded dawn...The laboring mother...Miriam's clamp slipped") with repetitive sentence stems. The closing scaffold ("But wait...Wait, must fit count...Actually, honing") is a generation artifact that obscures the intended closure image and triggers the Text-Artifact rule: −1.0 for touching closure, plus disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact cap. Information density is moderate; many lines restate emotional terrain rather than advance causality.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is vivid and controlled with strong imagery ("clouds parted like drawn curtains," "luminous flakes that drifted upward like fireflies reversing flight"). However, overwriting appears in clusters: multiple metaphors per sentence in high-pressure beats ("tidal wave crashing inward," "edges sharpening as crystals bloomed," "manacles," "velvet drone") without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops near the end: "scars, transformed" / "scars now stories" / "scars now stories etched in eternal ink." Template cadence in the quill sequence: "She drew... Gripping it... Dipping the quill... The quill danced." Deductions: density overload −0.5, loops −0.3, cadence −0.3; total −1.1 from a mid-7 base.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is dense with figurative language in nearly every line—"dust motes danced in slivers of dusk like lost souls," "currents bridging their palms in a jolt that tasted of ozone and overripe fruit"—creating a template cadence that dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "imperfect miracles crackled" / "imperfect miracle's haze" / "miracles are like these sheets—stained, torn, yet singing." Filter-verb stacks ("murmured it held," "advised through metaphors") and elevated diction ("ethereal tendrils coiling") drift from the POV's tabloid-column grounding. No loops touch closure directly, but the accumulation across high-pressure beats triggers the artifact penalty and disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The hush resounded triumphant" / "In resounding hush, peace reigned supreme"; "spiral arbitration unfolded" / "Spiral arbitration's verdict"; "walked outward... journeyed inward" repeated across dozens of lines. Template cadence dominates the final third: "He [verb]. The [noun] [verb]. Across [timeframe]…" Figurative language is dense without coherence—"hush resounded," "silent thunder," "breath between cosmic throbs"—and peak beats (the unification sequence) are summarized rather than propelled. These artifacts touch closure directly, warranting the lower band and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant patterned artifacts undermine momentum: "fjord quiet" appears seven times, "eminently peculiar" three times, "razor edges" six times, creating synonym loops and thematic over-signaling. Template cadence is pervasive with repeated stems ("The key's...", "The room...", "The fjord...") and participle openers. Paraphrase loops occur ("What did these clocks measure, if not time's flow, but its razor edges" restates the earlier motivation without added pressure). Mixed metaphors appear ("horizons bending like scimitars" clashes with the established water/shepherd imagery). Information density is moderate, but scaffold and repetition dull the closure beats. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack and loop deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but the piece carries pervasive text-pattern artifacts: synonym loops ("traverse," "traversal," "traversed" five times), prompt-label repetition ("theoretically rebellious," "lucid contradictions," "clover melancholy," "midsummer" recur mechanically), and template cadence (many sentences open with subject + past-tense verb in a drumbeat pattern). The final third escalates these loops ("Theoretically rebellious no more in isolation," "clover-melancholy victory"), dulling the closure image. Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("odds tilt toward hope," "perspectives widened, responsibly earned"). Applying patterned-artifact penalties: baseline −0.8 in Q7 for spread across beats, escalated to −1.2 for touching closure; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the tightened Q7 rule.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("sounds that were melodically haunted—ethereal wails twisting into sighs"), but several patterns recur: "rise and fade, rise and fade," "looped," "loop," "looping" appear eight times, some functional (motif) but others scaffold ("Over subsequent wrong-number loops"). Template cadence emerges in "He sat… He never corrected… He'd let… He spun," and the phrase "melodically haunted" itself is used twice with identical structure. The final paragraph cycles through "loop" three more times in five lines without adding new pressure. Information density is high in the setup but the closure beat ("Between hums, the cycle looped on") restates rather than advances. No major clarity breaks, but the loop motif tips from purposeful to artifact in the final third, triggering −0.6 for patterned repetition touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("forgotten whispers," "stardust regrets," "lover's breath," "seeking vines") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that slows momentum rather than charging beats. Paraphrase loops appear ("gently thorough" x3, "haunted euphoria" x4, "small moments" x5) and template cadence runs flatten rhythm ("She selected... She drew... She began... She lifted..."). The phrase "context changes" is used abstractly without grounding. Mixed metaphors (petals as vessels, ink incarnate, vapor-shapes) blur rather than sharpen. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat ("haunted euphoria swelled... euphoric waves... euphoric haunting"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies; no extended runs of identical sentence stems. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("rumors…slither through the ivy like mischievous vines"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "loneliness, that relentless shadow" is immediately echoed by "cures for their isolation"; "He'd vanish after each crisis" followed by "now, burned out, he craved his own relief" restates the same emotional arc. Template cadence in the exchange sequence ("A mechanic confessed…a poet traded…") flattens momentum. The scaffold "One held it, felt compelled…binding the next in turn" summarizes rather than dramatizes the key closure sequence, dulling the final image's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "invisible symphonies," "vibrations that wove through the air like threads of forgotten dreams," "languages of root and rain seeping into his veins like ink," "sorrow's bass," "rage's red rivers, peace's silver streams." Metaphor density approaches one per sentence in the climax without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "a trail emerged—not of footprints, but of musical notes" / "Each note, a high-pitched pulse… etched faintly into the air" restates the same content (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening: "Blind since birth, Elar crafted… His skin, attuned… Tonight, across…" (−0.4). Stock phrases: "quiet blaze," "forgotten dreams," "unresolved chords." Artifacts touch the closure beat ("evaporating into the blaze of understanding"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and carries figurative ambition, but density issues and loops significantly harm momentum. Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "confident uncertainty" elaborated across three sentences in paragraph 5, "contingent relationships" restated in paragraphs 4, 10, 16, 20; "thresh meaning" in paragraphs 1, 4, 15, 32, 34. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]" stems open at least eight beats, and exposition blocks (paragraphs 10–14, editing mechanics) stall pressure with summary rather than scene. Stock metaphors ("forgotten sighs," "hesitant moth," "starlit fluid") and elevated diction ("attenuate," "flux," "lexicon of edits") drift into thesaurus-itis without grounding in Elara's lived perception. The final third ("And in that strange comfort, meaning threshed itself eternal") crosses into purple abstraction at the closure beat, obscuring cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "timeframe when no one remembered him" echoes "now a shadow among tourists"; "disrupt" is declared, then restated as "disrupting this cacophony," then "They disrupted boldly." Stock metaphors cluster—"siren's subtle call," "feather-light murmur," "liquid moonlight"—without fresh synthesis. Synonym churn flattens momentum: "whispered," "murmured," "whispered-signed," "whisper the crescendo." Template cadence runs through Elara's actions: "She was… / She signed… / She lifted… / She explained…" The climax summarizes rather than dramatizes: "Feel the silence's melody" is told as command, not shown through reaction. Scaffold and loops touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, but metaphor appears in nearly every sentence without purposeful variation, creating a drumbeat rhythm that dulls momentum ("volcanic tenderness," "erupting in quiet sobs," "exploding like lava"). Paraphrase loops occur: "trailing… trail of artistic creations begging to be chased" and "portray… portraying… portrayed" cycle without added pressure. Sentence stems repeat: "She had [verb]" opens multiple beats. Peak moments rely on filter-verb stacks ("her breath hitched, tears carving paths") instead of direct image. The final paragraph's moralizing summary ("The arsonist had become guardian") replaces scene pressure with thematic statement. These artifacts spread across the story, touching the closure beat and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated description—blurring clarity in peak beats ("auric tendrils rising like spectral arms"). Template cadence runs appear: multiple "She [verb]" and "[Noun] [verb]ed" constructions across adjacent lines. Paraphrase loops are present: "memories no longer ghosts but bridges" closely echoes "memories flowed freely now, no longer chains but wings." Stock metaphors accumulate (velvet shroud, mournful spears, tender ache). Information density is uneven; the final stanza strings epigrams that restate theme rather than advance image. Clarity suffers under the ornamental load, particularly when drumming mechanics and lagoon physics would benefit from concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "containers looming like titans," "words slithered along the container walls," "pride shattered" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear ("whispers of victory humming farther than any roar" echoes the premise without adding pressure). Template cadence runs in the opening ("Lightning flickered... compasses... spinning... auroras smeared") and the ending sequence. The final third summarizes rather than dramatizes, diluting propulsion. Apply −0.6 for density overload and −0.4 for loops, total −1.0 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    Figurative density is extreme: nearly every sentence in the weaving sequence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("vortex of tranquility," "spiralingly calm intensifying into a hypnotic core," "tendrils of darkness recoiling"). Mixed metaphors appear ("spiralingly calm" as vortex, "stillwater tension coiling tighter"). Template cadence and paraphrase loops proliferate: "Elara met... sensing... understanding bloomed... Elara gestured... began the action... lifted the dental mirror... tilting it precisely." Penalty pack (−1.2): density without taught pattern, mixed vehicles, template stems across multiple beats. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades: figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching ("amplified quiet," "unspoken words," "forests of second thoughts" recur as synonym loops). Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: "mist...clung like forgotten regrets" anthropomorphizes fog with emotional baggage; "cradle of earth's deep magnetism" conflates nurture with geological force. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("He heard... He knelt... He distributed..."). Paraphrase loops cluster in the final paragraph ("forests destined," "seeds had taken," "groves"). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("amplified quiet reigned, but now it whispered"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is ambitious and lyric but overwritten in peak beats: "combative tenderness," "swords sheathed in velvet," "savage liberty," and "sea-born liberty" stack figurative language without adding clarity. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences ("Elara glided… she hefted… It was the era… Feuds simmered"). Paraphrase loops are present: "detach now… from this shore that binds us" echoes "tethered life" and "cage" from earlier beats without advancing pressure. The whale's call is told three times in quick succession ("low rumble," "haunting call," "whale's song") without new information. Spatial choreography at the climax (skiff, oars, mooring rope, island) is functional but the sequence lacks propulsion because each action is narrated rather than compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high in the whittling and turbine beats, and sensory detail (shavings, blood, crumbling petals) advances atmosphere. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "emotional void" recurs four times, "remade hush" five times, and "morally ambiguous" three times, often in adjacent or nearby lines without added pressure. The stock phrase "blank-faced performer" is repeated identically across beats. Template cadence clusters in the narration sequences: "Behold," "See here," "Thus, I remake." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Figurative language ("whispers," "snow of detachment," "feather now, not stone") is frequent but mostly coherent; mixed metaphors are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "aesthetically driven" (×2), "tremor of certainty" (×3), "dissolving boundaries" (×4), and repeated sentence stems ("He [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]"). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "cloak woven from fleeting umbras," "quartz essence," "lantern-moth wisps" cluster without clear payoff at closure. Register drifts into abstract philosophical diction ("aesthetic audacity," "profound knowing," "conceptual repricing") mid-scene without voice motivation. Mixed metaphors: moths drawn to lanterns vs. cloud-shadows striding; quartz turning liquid vs. pillars leaning. Information density is low—many lines restate the crossing theme without advancing situation or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid images ("phoenix-feather ferns crossed with slumberwort," "bellows collapsed like weary lungs"), but several template cadences appear: "Heart quickening, Elias scavenged... and pried free... This tongue, once her voice..." The phrase "innocently cunning" recurs as a label without fresh illustration. The final paragraph stacks abstractions—"haven of bartered awakenings," "cunning innocence of embracing cracks," "futures imperfect and true"—that summarize theme rather than deliver a concrete closing image. Minor paraphrase loops (e.g., Elias's motivation restated across opening and midpoint) reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe overwriting pervades the piece: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("golden shadows stretched long and languid," "prism-song bloomed," "whispers of extinct dialects lingered"), creating a dense, uniform texture that flattens urgency. Template cadence is evident in repeated "She struck… and [result]" constructions across chambers. Paraphrase loops: "texture of connection" and "weave of souls entwined" restate the same concept; "powerfully gentle" appears three times without added meaning. Mixed metaphors: sound "fracturing into harmonious shards" then becoming "silken threads," then "fibrous and warm," then "gossamer yet unbreakable"—vehicles shift without coherent physical logic. Register drift into elevated diction ("vortexed cries," "multisensory hymn") clashes with the immediate present. The closure beat is dense with metaphor ("scarred, resonant grit binding all," "golden weave") that obscures rather than clarifies the final image. Apply −1.4 for pervasive density, coherence breaks, and closure-beat opacity; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops permeate peak beats: "withering edges greening into fervent bloom" / "stars birthing in symphonic ardor" restate revival without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the middle third ("She found... She pierced... Folding with meticulous care... Each figure embodied..."). Figurative density ("curtains of intention," "tattoo of hope," "eternity's jewelry") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating metaphor blur. Stock metaphors ("spark ignited," "transmuting into purpose") dull the closure image. Filter-verb stacks ("begin to illuminate," "watched... tears tracing") flatten immediacy in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.9)
    The opening sentence delivers vivid sensory detail and voice, and the tarot-spread demonstration integrates concrete action with measurement. However, pervasive patterned artifacts pull the score down: "steadily curious" appears five times as an adjective or modifier, becoming template cadence; "inherited mystery" recurs four times without evolving; synonym loops cluster around "confide/confided" (three uses in close proximity). Figurative language is dense but occasionally strains clarity—"onyx-ink cartomancer" front-loads a compound modifier that delays grounding, and "multiplied paths" functions as both method and metaphor without tight definition until midpoint. The final paragraph stacks abstract closers—"map reborn," "true north," "new secrets"—that gesture toward resonance without concrete image anchor. Information density is high, yet scaffolding phrases ("as thunder grumbled," "the loft seemed to hum") pad transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.6)
    Patterned-artifact penalty (−1.0): Heavy figurative density in every line ("dust motes danced like fleeting regrets," "skies heavy with unspoken doom," "soul's fragile weave," "frozen scream of light") without pattern-teaching or payoff; mixed metaphors ("atoms of nostalgia," "quantum dance"); stock metaphor strings ("veil of history's lies," "paradise lost") in peak beats. Paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences: "To pursue the forbidden truth… one must purify the mind" followed by "Purify by avoiding patterns… commanded." Template cadence: "She cataloged… she began to shun… she placed her palm… she saw… she emerged" runs across six paragraphs without syntactic variation. Information density is low; most sentences restate "anguished joy" or "steadily unpredictable" without advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.6)
    Repeated scaffold structures dominate: "The library [verb]," "Elara [verb]," "She [verb]" appear in runs across the text. Paraphrase loops in the final third ("Hope endured, shaped against oblivion" followed by "Hope bloomed unbound no more") restate the same closure without added pressure. Figurative language is dense ("blooming," "petals," "luminous") but often decorative, with mixed metaphors (petals that unfurl vs. curling inward under stress). Stock openers ("One dusk, sharper than most") and template cadence ("Dusk settled fully. She smiled faintly. The library hummed.") accumulate into line-level drag. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence across closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft shows deliberate rhythm and sensory detail, but multiple patterns accumulate: "quietly vivid" appears three times, "shimmering stillness" twice, and structural parallelism ("She peeled back," "She placed," "She reconstructed") creates template cadence across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loops emerge ("fragile convictions trembled" / "fragile convictions, once splintered, now gleamed"). Stock metaphors ("voices a soft thread," "cocoon of ethereal calm") and elevated register ("testament to fragile convictions made whole") reduce immediacy in peak beats. Filter verbs ("felt a pull," "watched, mesmerized") stack without voice justification. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically dense, but several lines carry figurative overload without clear payoff: "meteor hush, a silent vastness pressing against the stone walls like cosmic dust settling after a star's quiet death" stacks three metaphors in one breath. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions—"The air hung... She was... Her deepest motivation burned... The surgery below had promised"—that flatten propulsion. Paraphrase loops surface: "closure lay buried" is restated as "dig, reopen the fresh surgical wound if needed, for closure lay buried" within two lines. The coffee-ring method is introduced but its mechanics (how rings map to action) remain vague, reducing information density at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "brass gears whispered like conspirators," "celluloid brittle as autumn leaves," "ducts twisting like veins," "emotions spatially imaginative minds could reclaim." In peak beats (film contact, panel prying, final projection) metaphor and elevated register ("gestate," "incubating," "midwifed") persist without modulation, triggering overwriting penalty (−0.5). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She" or "The" in the middle section ("She closed," "She needed," "She visualized," "She pried," "She'd return," "She smiled"). Paraphrase loop: "unused love" recurs four times across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines advance action, but several ("ethereal strands weaving through velvet seats below, humming incompleteness") ornament without plot work. No major causality breaks, but momentum drags under decorative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    Figurative language is dense and often abstract: "silent symphonies of longing," "thoughts like radio waves," "stardust imprisoned by forgotten origins" stack without concrete grounding, particularly in the inciting beat. Template cadence appears in repeated "unspoken words" constructs and "She [verb]" stems. Paraphrase loops occur ("trapped creativity was no mere block; it was stardust imprisoned," "ideas erupting like novas" / "creativity freed"). The closure beat is dulled by summary ("visions cascaded," "stardust awoke") rather than clean action, triggering −1.2 for artifacts touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and the piece reads aloud with lyric cadence. Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions. However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "purpose blooms within" / "motivation stirs, unbidden"; "freight he guards" / "no longer mere cargo"; "dreamless vigil fractures" / "dreamless no longer quite so." Template cadence runs are present: "He + verb" stems cluster in the middle third ("He pauses," "He lifts," "He knows," "He moves," "He sets"). Stock metaphors recur without fresh inflection ("heavy as a silenced heart," "click, though time denies it"). The figurative language is dense but sometimes muddles ("wave functions coiling like smoke from a dying pyre" mixes quantum abstraction with combustion imagery). Apply paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.5), and stock-metaphor (−0.3) deductions for cumulative −1.0 in Q7, plus mild figurative muddle (−0.3). These artifacts touch multiple beats but do not obscure the closure image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dense figurative language pervades high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching (e.g., "jungle of raw ideas overgrown with thorned intuitions, starved by years of stray philosophy's sterile pruning"), triggering the Overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops recur: "the hum of insight" is repeated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "wild frontier" and "probable miracle" cycle as labels rather than evolving images. Template cadence runs appear in the corewheel sequence ("Climbing its spokes, Elias confronted… Its hum had awakened… As wind lashed…"). Several sentences restate rather than advance ("the hum intensified, resolving into the sound of wind" restates the method already established). These cumulative artifacts obscure closure momentum, triggering −1.0 total and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact-in-final-third rule.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence damage momentum: "gently persistent" recurs identically three times; "traverse/traversed" appears five times; "leash-broken" and "unused courage" are repeated without variation. Figurative language stacks without pattern payoff ("veiled ridgeway," "shoreline lullaby," "twilight vigil" recycled mechanically). Synonym churn for "path" (route, ridgeway, way) and stock metaphors ("shells buried in wet sand," "kelp in tide") flatten texture. Closure beat suffers from summary telling ("forever changed") rather than concrete image. Applying −1.2 for loops/artifacts and −0.3 for figurative density without coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope," "cobalt womb," "silent-choir aura thickening into tangible grief" stack figurative language without clear vehicles. Paraphrase loops appear ("safety's cost: a life of seraphically mundane atonement" restates the prior sentence). Template cadence: "He sought refuge…," "He settled…," "He had fled…" runs across multiple paragraphs. The archive-log exposition ("Years prior, Thorne's choir rehearsed…") is scaffolding that summarizes rather than dramatizes. Density is high but clarity suffers at the closure beat, where metaphor ("frost, not tears," "choral waves crashing soundlessly") obscures the stakes of Thorne's response.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "dust motes hung eternal," "honeyed decrees," "fragile weave," "rusty-black," "mist among stacks," "chaff before the gale," "silken ruin," "autumn leaves," "elegant arcs." In the climax paragraph alone, metaphors stack without breathing room—"spectral light," "cascade of silken ruin," "autumn leaves," "elegant arcs"—blurring the concrete action. Template cadence appears in paired descriptors ("regally unpretentious," "rusty-black," "graceful collapse"). Paraphrase loop: "the pause broken by verity's quiet triumph" and "constellations resuming their dance" restate closure twice. Apply −0.6 for density in peak beats, −0.3 for template cadence, −0.2 for paraphrase loop, totaling −1.1; artifacts touch closure, so cap at 5.4 per artifact penalty pack and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that support the accumulative design. Information density is high in the assembly sequence, where each beat layers data points. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Taps guided his hands, rhythms dictating piece by piece" closely echoes "tapping rhythms transmitted the assembled map"; "periodically eternal" recurs in identical phrasing three times without reweighting. Template cadence in the middle third: "He pried…gathering," "He wired…assembling," "He tapped…rhythms evolving" creates a monotonous He-verb stem run across four paragraphs. Mixed metaphor: "revelation crested like a rogue wave" after "Dawn broke with partial clarity" stacks oceanic and solar figures without coherence. Deductions: paraphrase −0.2, template cadence −0.5, mixed metaphor −0.4, stock phrase ("eyes on horizons reborn") −0.2; total artifact penalty −1.3 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.8)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "thunderous serenity" appears six times, "awkwardly confident" four times, "barefoot" five times, often within a single sentence of prior mention. Template cadence runs through the final third: "She [verb]. Elara [verb]. The [noun] [verb]." Stock metaphors dominate peak beats: "like a heart paused before the storm," "sparks leaping," "fury's prelude." Mixed vehicle: "thunderous serenity" is contradictory without coherent sensory grounding. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the hum," "saw the convergence") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure unit ("meaning bloomed eternal"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.9)
    Opening sentences anchor voice and stakes efficiently, but synonym loops appear in the second paragraph: "her white hair streaked with ash" followed by "fiery battles," then "harsh lessons" and "relentless" waters. Template cadence runs through the climax—"Clutching the amber embryo… she chanted the decoded rite… The plants amplified her will… Fluids mingled… Visions flooded"—each clause opening with a participial or subject-verb stem in parallel. Figurative density is high throughout ("steam veiled the rising sun," "glyphs that danced like steam plumes," "roared like insurgent war cries") without pattern-teaching, blurring clarity in peak beats. The phrase "telepathic bond ensuring the Caldera's traditions bloomed anew, rooted in purpose" stacks metaphors (bond/bloomed/rooted) that contradict vehicle logic. Proofreading is clean, and information density is generally strong, but the artifact load in the final third disallows 9+ globally and caps this category near 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short fragments during freeze: "She froze there on the path, photograph trembling in her grip, the world narrowing"), and sensory detail is vivid (salt spray, hammering pulse, dew in chest). Yet paraphrase loops appear: "no longer tyrants but guides" / "no longer a wound but a marker," and the phrase "pearl of stillness" recurs four times without functional variation, reading as motif assertion rather than propulsion. Filter-verb stacks ("her body betrayed her first," "her muscles seizing") cluster in the freeze beat, dulling immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwritten with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("luminescent ache," "claustrophobic vortex," "mournful fireflies"), creating a sluggish rhythm that dulls urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: "necessary darkness" recurs five times without added pressure; "fragmented reality" is restated in adjacent lines ("shattered eyes, disjointed smiles"). Template cadence runs proliferate ("He gathered... he noticed... he began..."). Stock metaphors ("shards of a shattered mirror") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to close in," "saw only fragments") reduce immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("fragmented reality coalesced"), triggering −1.7 per the artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose carries heavy overwriting throughout: "sinuous, bone-like forms that whispered of endurance," "deliberate feral grace," "serene anger," "ephemeral patterns: swirling mandalas of azure fractals that danced and reformed like living runes." Stock metaphor strings ("time's secret," "ink's embrace," "raw pulse of the wild") cluster in peak beats without specificity. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "He moved…rejecting…"; "A serene anger simmered…none more maddening…"; "That question burned…propelling…". Paraphrase loops are frequent: "time slows for those consciously wild, rejecting fate's haste" echoes the earlier "rejecting the encampment's fragile order for the raw pulse of the wild." Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to hold its breath," "his voice echoed") dull immediacy. The closure beat summarizes ("he understood now") rather than showing in image or action, and the final line ("the wind-carved world sharper in crisis's wake") is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. "Bravely conflicted" appears three times; "dizzying quiet" four times; "contraband truths" five times, creating synonym churn without added pressure. Adjacent sentences restate the same content: "duty warring with a deeper urge" / "bravely conflicted between preservation and provocation." Long runs share identical stems ("She had prepared," "She pictured," "She moved"). Stock metaphors ("quiet fire," "electric hush") and filter-verb stacks ("she glimpsed," "she pictured," "she sealed") dull immediacy at peak beats. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.2 in Q7 for loops, cadence runs, and filter stacks across multiple beats, with artifacts touching the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "quiet" recurs as engraved/quiet/hush/silence without added pressure; "tranquil blaze" appears five times unchanged. Template cadence runs dominate action beats ("She knelt… her hands sinking… she coaxed… A glint caught… she lifted… she tore"). Heavy figurative density in high-pressure moments ("petals a serene inferno," "allies now steeped in her inculcated values") muddies clarity. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to lean," "felt its history hum") dull immediacy during the looter confrontation. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the disallow-9+ cap and heavy penalty in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language ("translucent scrolls transliterating emotions," "thorny echoes that snagged on sonic thorns," "silvery thread...zigzagging wildly"). Density penalty (−0.5) and register drift into elevated abstraction in peak beats (−0.4). Paraphrase loops appear: "The garden hushed, waves settling into reformed patterns, constellations resuming their dreamy prowl" mirrors earlier pattern-language without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the closing lines ("Feral lullaby claimed another verse. / Elias smiled faintly...") stacks short declarative stems (−0.4). Total artifact load: −1.5, and the final-third placement disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting: "orbits of regret" appears six times, "echoing" five times, "solemn playfulness" three times, creating paraphrase loops and metaphor saturation that flatten momentum. Template cadence runs ("she [verb], [noun] [verb]") dominate the middle third. Mixed metaphors: regrets cannot simultaneously orbit, tighten, decay, and recede like comets without violating physics. Register drift into abstract philosophizing ("proof by contradiction...showing your tale devours itself") clashes with scene urgency. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("truths unveiled, ready to rewrite the stars"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("frost," "history's throat," "guilt's orchestra," "time's creases," "meteor hush enveloping all"), creating tonal consistency but occasionally blurring clarity in high-pressure beats—how exactly does the firmware "tether" to the tattoo? Several paraphrase loops appear: "cries softened to breaths, then silence, the meteor hush enveloping all" and "Time unfolded gently, the lab steadying" restate the same resolution without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: multiple "He + verb" or "Elias + verb" openings. Sentence rhythm varies well early but flattens near closure. Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "whimsical" appears six times, "socially perceptive" four times, "lilac" eight times, often in template stems ("Elara, ever socially perceptive," "Her whimsical nature," "lilac unease"). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("unlearning had begun," "human tangles," "emergent hush") that slows momentum during the climactic confrontation. Mixed metaphors occur (mist "coiling" and "settling," mandala "swirling" and "forming emergent patterns") without coherent physical logic. The final paragraph stacks four summarizing sentences that restate closure themes already shown, deflating propulsion. Apply −1.2 for pervasive template cadence and loop artifacts across beats, including the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed metaphors ("warm coldness—affectionate hatred, tender savagery") that blur rather than sharpen. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She knelt… She saw… She felt… Her fingers…" Paraphrase loops are present: "the tessera's pulse, its fractures mapping the minaret's fall" restates "chipped patterns formed subtle glyphs" without added pressure. The closing sequence stacks scaffold: "The shattered sky flickered… Survivors approached… She had renamed… Her gentle radicalism proved…" Strong verb choices ("wept cold light," "clamping around") appear, but scaffold and overwriting in peak beats (the closure) trigger penalties. Filter-verb density remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is dense, but nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("verdant greens that swirled with the night's chill blue," "symphonies of crimson and amber," "vocal ripples cascading"), creating a uniformly lyric register that dulls propulsion in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "nostalgia tugged," "rising nostalgia," "Nostalgia swelled, no longer rising but cresting," "Nostalgia, once a wound." Template stems recur: "Synesthesia amplified it," "synesthetic bursts painting," "synesthesia now a gift reborn." These artifacts pervade the closure sequence, reducing clarity of the final turn and disqualifying 9+ globally per the filter-verb and template-cadence penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching: "willowglass hope" (×4), "fractally precise" (×3), "somatic marker" (×5), and "hidden pathways" (×3) recur as conceptual shorthand, triggering −0.6 for density and coherence drift. Paraphrase loops appear ("Their love had deepened post-pill, or so it felt—telepathic echoes weaving their thoughts into willowglass hope" restates doubt-versus-connection without advancing it). Sentence openings vary and grammar is clean, preventing further decay, but information density suffers under the weight of repeated abstractions that summarize rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "transition/transitional" appears nine times, often within adjacent lines ("transitional power, a bridge object"; "transitional objects for her kin"). Template cadence dominates the ending: "Her maps now…" / "Doubters once…" / "Each heat-mapped…" / "Years blurred…" The phrase "factually mystical" is repeated as a conceptual anchor but becomes a tic. Mid-scene clarity is stronger (fossil discovery, cave choreography), but the final third collapses into summary with synonym churn ("voice," "whisper," "narrated," "carried forth"). Figurative language mixes registers: "veins etched like lightning" is vivid; "core concept incarnate" is abstract filler.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor or elevated diction ("unearthed silence," "hoarded dreams of ancient seas," "time's cruel knot"), reducing clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("prophecy chained the future, a rigid fate" / "prophecy's rigid form into raw possibility"). Template cadence runs through the middle third ("He lifted it... He knew this echo... His motivation burned clear... Quietly inspired, he sought"). The final paragraph stacks assertions without scene grounding ("fates no longer foreclosed," "possibilities cataloged eternally"). Information density is low; many lines restate theme rather than advance causality.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.1)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "unused courage" appears six times, "prudently daring" four times, "silver hush" five times, "fixing/fixed" four times, often in adjacent or near-adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("He [verb], she [verb]") and stock metaphors ("eyes igniting," "potential coiled tight like a spring uncoiling") dull immediacy at peak beats. The final third stacks declarative summaries ("The network breathed anew," "Zephyr Bluff faded into mist," "He had found where unused courage waits") that restate rather than advance, and the closing paragraph—eight short assertions—reads as thematic checklist rather than propulsive closure. Mixed metaphor: "potential coiled tight like a spring uncoiling" contradicts itself within one image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "fog-bound" appears six times, "ambient awareness" and "closely attentive" recur without variation, and lines like "Gutters ticked languidly now, rain's serenade fading to whispers" restate earlier beats. Template cadence dominates mid-story ("As raindrops percolated... so too did memories begin to percolate"). Figurative density (spindrift, palimpsest, percolation) in nearly every sentence blurs propulsion. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts and loops; since artifacts touch closure ("spindrift peace distilled his soul's complexity forever"), disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft shows selective detail and rhythmic variety, with effective compression in beats like "chimney smoke began to flatten." However, several paraphrase loops appear: "thrumming swelled" / "thrumming peaked" / "Thrumming faded" across adjacent paragraphs restates intensity without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("velvet hush," "golden haze") and template cadence in the final third ("Some places, he knew, simply chose the light of mercy. / With that, he rose...") introduce scaffold that dulls momentum. Figurative language density in the climax (spectral hum, phantom bees, invisible lattice) risks overwriting without pattern-taught payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "moonlight silvered the waves like spilled mercury," "buoys glowing like fallen stars," "vulnerability peeling back layer by layer." Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("Splash—her rosebush's final petal… Lift—the fire escape garden thrived"). Paraphrase loops cluster in the harbor scene: "quivering hush" repeated three times within six paragraphs, "wistfully pragmatic" twice. Mixed metaphor in "loss etched… fear pooling like oil slicks on shadowed tides" blurs the image. Deductions: density −0.5, loop −0.4, register drift −0.3, totaling approximately −1.2 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies across beats, and sensory detail is vivid in the opening and ritual sequences. However, multiple prose artifacts undermine momentum: paraphrase loops ("By the hum of an ancient stone circle" appears three times with minimal functional variation; "brittle awakenings" recurs as a conceptual label without fresh pressure), template cadence in the final third ("No more brittle fractures; her awakenings solidified into purpose. The brass sundial spun freely now..."), and synonym churn ("isolation," "independence," "coexistence" cycle without advancing meaning). The closure sequence stacks declarative summary lines ("Independence, won through coexistence. Above the clouds, forever.") that flatten propulsion. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear moderately but do not overwhelm. Information density is uneven—early paragraphs compress backstory efficiently, but the ending expands into repetitive affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "keeper of secrets" appears five times, "prismatic" seven times, "thread" six times, "spiral" nine times without reweighting. Template cadence: "Elara [verb]...Theo [verb]" structures dominate the reunion. Mixed metaphors: "thread" and "spiral" are forced into equivalence; "prismatic quiet" is conceptually incoherent (prisms refract, incompatible with quiet). Overwriting saturates high-pressure beats: "tears prismatic on her cheeks" during the reunion. Filter verbs stack: "she realized," "she vowed," "she smiled" in the final passage. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the escalated penalty and 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is vivid in patches ("ozone before a storm," "stones grinding in her skull") but loops and template cadence pervade the final third. "Cautiously hopeful" appears as an opener or filter five times, creating a drumbeat effect. Paraphrase loops recur: "power plays" is asserted four times without varied syntax. Several beats summarize rather than dramatize (the crowd's "divide fracturing" happens off-page, Harlan's collapse is told in a line). The closing paragraphs stack scaffold sentences ("The charts promised more," "The community mended unevenly") that restate the situation without advancing it. Clarity is mostly intact, but density and propulsion sag under repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Wistful no more, yet ever rebellious" echoes "wistful longing" and "rebellion stirred" from earlier beats without added pressure; "Elias [verb], [noun] [verb]-ing" stems recur across a dozen sentences. Stock metaphors ("silver daggers," "predatory jaws," "beast's heart") cluster without fresh vehicle logic. The final third devolves into thematic summary—"The fallow period ended not with silence, but symphonic triumph," "testament to prudent daring"—that restates closure rather than advancing it. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "found," "grasped") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Information density is low; many lines rephrase prior content (e.g., "spaces locked in rebellious stasis" immediately follows "halting the walls' advance"). Artifact spread touches the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 baseline and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and prompt-word scaffolding pervade the text: "furrowed," "dormant," "lance/lancet," and "opposites" recur mechanically without tightening meaning. Template cadence: "She logged each step... she knelt... she pocketed... she paced" across adjacent beats (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "empathy uncoiling like mist burned by dawn" (mist doesn't uncoil; dawn doesn't burn mist away in that manner). Stock phrasing: "mysteries yielded," "light unified all," "portraitist unbound" (−0.6 cumulative). The final third contains heavy artifact load, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: "spongey dread" appears eight times, often in adjacent sentences ("spongey dread permeated… spongey portent… Spongey dread thickened… spongey dread lingered… Yet spongey dread endured"). Mixed metaphors muddle peak beats: fog "absorbing resolve like a vast, insidious sponge," then dread is "spongey," then the nail "pulsing with spongey portent"—the vehicle collapses under repetition. Template cadence runs through multiple "nervously confident" insertions and synonym loops ("declared stakes," "ringing declarations," "steady despite quivering knees"). Paraphrase loops recur: "reversible exile haunted her dreams; one decoded truth could reinstate their name" is re-stated in "The guild exiled him reversibly… pending proof like this." Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("jet stream's cataclysmic shift," "insidious sponge") that clashes with librarian particularity. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: loops and template cadence across multiple beats, touching the closure paragraph ("spongey dread endured") → baseline −1.0 in Q7, escalated to −1.4 for touching closure, plus disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries figurative language or elevated diction ("gilding the aspens in golden disbelief," "merciful anonymity," "spectral wings"). Paraphrase loops appear: the concept of "pixelated amnesty" is restated across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence and synonym churn ("luminous" appears six times) flatten momentum. Register drift into poetic abstraction clashes with the fiddler's working-class occupation. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering cumulative penalty (−1.7) and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: "bruised purple and fading gold," "monsoon ink," "dragon scales," "twilight lanterns," "melancholic peace" stack figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "perceptively calm" / "polished calm" / "perceptively calm" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: "Word spread... The startup surged... Elias dissuaded..." creates drumbeat rhythm. Synonym churn ("dissuaded," "dissuasion") and stock metaphors ("moths to twilight lanterns") reduce clarity. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("paths circled," "dusky embrace"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades: "midnight wrapped the world in a blanket of solace," "dawn's promise," "celestial symphony for shared souls." Mixed metaphors ("burden that gnawed," "tears tracing solace's path") and template cadence in final third ("Witness to wonders, they shone. Through variables and vows, understanding endured.") dull momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("burden lifting," "burdens lightened"; "solace," "midnight solace," "solace's path" recur without reweighting). Stock metaphors (nova, symphony, dawn) cluster in closure beats. Figurative density in final paragraph triggers −0.7; template stems and loops add −0.6, total −1.3 within Q7 per artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence saturate the text. "Guarded" appears seven times, often in recycled phrases ("guarded druid," "guarded nature," "guarded heart," "unyielding guard," "unguarded soul"). Synonym churn: "serene inevitability / warlike serenity / poised tranquility," "expanding circles / tightening spirals / methodical serenity." Stock metaphors cluster without variation: "fortress," "fire," "shattering mirrors." Sentence stems repeat: "The [noun] [verb]ed… / Thorne [verb]ed… / The [noun] [verb]ed…" Figurative density in high-pressure beats (plant growth, confession thaw) piles modifiers—"acidic relish," "serrated blades," "confession's fire"—that blur rather than sharpen action. Information density is low; many lines restate without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and sensory detail is vivid ("cobalt glow," "sap-blood mingled"), but template cadence pervades: "She was," "She heeded," "Purposefully curious, she" recur across beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "root-bound visionary" / "root-bonds," "anxious elation" repeated four times without reweighting. The ritual sequence (link → pain → threads → visions → restoration) compresses complex action into summary rather than moment-by-moment propulsion. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but scaffold phrases ("the method of linking through scars," "the nexus's radiant chaos") slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.3)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Elara had come…Elara's soul ached…Elara felt…Elara smiled…Elara departed" recurs across eight beats; "fiercely gentle" and "reckless idealist" cycle without added pressure. Mixed metaphors ("roots…like veins through marble" juxtaposed with "roots groaned, coiling to trammel") and stock metaphors ("heart a…flame," "glow pulsing like a heartbeat") reduce clarity in peak beats. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy paraphrase loops: "confidently uncertain" appears four times; "wresting" recurs mechanically; "echoes" proliferates without fresh meaning. Template cadence dominates the final third: "He'd wrested... He climbed... Echoes faded... Harl drove... Valley longing softened... Tomorrow, he'd appraise... Facts and heart aligned... The road unspooled... Harl pressed..." The fragment-sentence run at the end reads like a checklist rather than purposeful compression. Figurative language in mid-story (silver threads, feedback whine, valley longing) is vivid, but the closing abstractions ("horizon pull," "infinite as memory") muddle clarity. Apply −1.2 for loops and template cadence touching closure, plus −0.3 for scaffold density in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence pervades: "Elias [verb], [noun] [participle]" across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops cluster mid-story ("haunted ambitions," "methodical," "kindly" recycled without fresh pressure). Figurative density is high ("particle shifting quantum states," "magnetic flux lines parting") but often decorative rather than propulsive. Sentence openings vary little in the middle third. Information density is acceptable; each line advances mood or world detail, but scaffold phrases ("touching distance," "reestablished") repeat without evolving meaning. No critical opacity, but momentum drags under weight of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the tidal-atrium setup. However, the final third loops thematic vocabulary without advancing pressure: "Wanderers came and went, their migrations a tapestry of serene flux. Wintersun slanted lower, gilding gears and waves alike" restates serenity redundantly. "Fluctuates/fluctuating" appears three times in close proximity, and "wonder" recurs nine times, often as a label rather than embodied. The smelting beat is clear, but the denouement dilutes momentum with paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from overwriting, template cadence, and synonym loops. Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("resonant hush," "labyrinthine glow," "heartbeat of a hesitation," "vortex's heart," "latent radiance," "subtle thrum") without variation or payoff, triggering the density penalty. Scaffold phrases recur: "acquired abandoned hopes" appears three times; "walls between hearts" and "resonant hush" loop without reweighting. Stock metaphors (walls as barriers, pearl as hope) and abstract modifiers blur concrete action. Information density is low—many sentences restate theme rather than advance situation. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes, and the closure beat is dulled by synonym churn ("quiet reign," "unity"). Applying the patterned-artifact pack: baseline −1.0 for loops and template stems, escalated to −1.4 for pervasive figurative density and closure-beat contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "raw edges" echoed by "fractured lungs," "mournful solace" by "raw solace"; "methodically" appears nine times. Template cadence runs dominate: "He'd planned… dawn arrival, quadrant-by-quadrant search" and "He descended… He sketched… He sat… He played." Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh charge: "tendrils snaking," "dust motes danced," "forgiveness flowed." Figurative density in the graffiti beat ("palimpsest," "veins across faded tiles," "breadcrumb from past pilgrims") muddles rather than propels. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("soul's renewed cartography"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language ("veil fluttering like whispered secrets," "mists curling like tentative fingers," "delays dissolving into timeless clarity") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties. Paraphrase loops recur: "cautious exuberance" appears three times, "cyclically reversed" twice in adjacent paragraphs restating the same mechanic. Template cadence in the middle section: "She [verb], [gerund]" across four consecutive beats. Synonym churn ("exhilaration," "exuberance," "thrill") and stock metaphors ("heart racing yet restrained") dull momentum at the cipher-solving climax. Combined artifacts touch closure ("emerged transformed"), disallowing 9+ globally and applying −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.1)
    Density is high but repetitive: "mulberry ache" appears four times, "perforated/perforations" six times, "propagate/propagating" nine times in 800 words—synonym churn without evolving meaning. Template cadence: "The [noun] [verbed]" opens seven sentences. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 7–8 restate that the violin can "propagate prophetic harmonies" and "reshape destiny." Mixed metaphors: "roots that bind dream to dominion" and "perforations sealing with inky vines" clash vehicle logic. Register drifts into academic ("enchanted provenance from polar fates") mid-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "beautified with luminescent powders…mortified with solemn rites" is immediately restated in "beautician mortician of this liminal realm." "Threshold of stillness" and variants appear five times, blurring into synonym churn. Figurative density is high but mixed: "aurora wove rivers of light" (water/fabric mismatch) and "static's weave into the emerald chip" (mixing electrical static with textile metaphor). Stock fantasy phrasing ("perilous boundary," "encroaching oblivion," "eternal ward") flattens texture. The final paragraph summarizes triumph rather than landing a concrete image with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose clarity is serviceable, but multiple artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("perpetual twilight wove shadows," "umbral veil," "shadows lifting"), template cadence in the ritual sequence ("Elara knelt... began to scallop... carved undulating edges... waves of silver light"), and stock metaphors ("soft as falling dew," "spirit synced"). The phrase "kindly decisive" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. Filter-verb stacks appear ("felt it then," "sensed," "pondered"). The scalloping action—central to closure—is described with elevated diction ("undulating edges into each petal, waves of silver light trailing") that prioritizes texture over momentum. Overall, −1.2 for combined loop/template/filter debt across the final third, with artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "his certainty hardening like frost" echoes "certainty's cloak shed"; "protected yet vulnerable" recurs as "protected vulnerability" without progression. Template cadence runs appear: "Alex [verb], [noun] [verb-ing]" across multiple lines. Stock metaphors ("hooks in the soul," "fog-like threads") accumulate without fresh embodiment. The final third dissolves into sentence fragments ("Nuance welcomed, the dawn felt infinite") that feel algorithmic rather than voice-motivated, and the closure beat—"Alex smiled, breeze-kissed and free"—is buried in summary rather than dramatized with concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.0)
    The piece suffers from paraphrase loops ("through the trance" appears five times), template cadence (repeated "Wait, …" meta-commentary), and figurative overloading in every sentence of the trance beat without taught pattern or payoff. The self-aware scaffolding ("Restart mental draft," "True output begins now") is generation artifact that obscures story momentum (−1.0). Stock phrases ("heart pounding," "transfixed") and mixed metaphors ("silver hair falling like reversed waterfalls") further reduce clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is ornate and rhythmically controlled, with strong sensory anchors ("dust-choked dawn," "clack-clack-clack," "bruised sky"). However, figurative density crowds nearly every sentence without acceleration: "fossilized spines of titanic beasts," "weathered prayers," "pulse left wandering," "aerial scripture," "living map," "fulfilled prophecy" stack without earned payoff, flattening momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 13–15 restate Thren's waiting across months/years/decades with synonym churn ("persisted"/"vigil"/"patience into something eternal") and template cadence ("Days blurred…" / "Months carved…" / "Years passed…" / "Decades layered…"). These artifacts dull the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.1)
    Density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("winds howled like automated elegies," "clouds parted like silk," "chorus of ice cracking into prisms") applies metaphor in most sentences without a taught pattern, triggering the Overwriting penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "simple" recurs across adjacent lines without added pressure ("sacred in the simple," "simple stone," "simple: footfalls," "eternally simple"). Template cadence runs of "He [verb]" and "Thorne [verb]" span multiple sentences. Stock metaphor strings ("brilliance dimmed," "lingering luminance," "brilliant dimness") blur specificity. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("eternally simple"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Combined artifact penalty in Q7: −1.4 (paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor/register drift −0.5).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is dense with figurative language—"meteor hush," "lantern-gold veined with meteor silver," "luminous vows"—that often obscures rather than clarifies. Paraphrase loops appear: "hiding behind truth" is restated multiple times without added pressure. Phrases like "wandering purposefully" and "signified everything" tell rather than show. The closure beat is clouded by abstract diction ("prismatic swirl," "essence in these luminous vows") that replaces concrete action with poeticized summary. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prompt-label phrases ("cast lots decision maker," "quietly enthusiastic," "wavelength align with purpose," "understanding static bursts") recur verbatim across multiple beats, creating paraphrase loops and register drift that dull immediacy. Template cadence is visible: "She [verb], [modifier]" stems repeat without variation. Figurative density is high ("ambered observatory," "stellar doubt," "backwards prophecy") but metaphors often collide (amber as preservation, stellar doubt as gravitational hesitation) without coherent vehicle. Filter verbs stack ("she saw," "she listened," "she murmured") in high-pressure moments. Information density is moderate; many lines restate the prophecy's backward arc without advancing new detail. The artifacts touch the closure beat ("her wavelengths synced at last"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and grammatically clean, but overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "scattered light dancing across the plinth," "jagged ice forming from light," "glittering monument" stack figurative language without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("The echo of sacrifice amplified" / "sacrifice's echo resolving" / "sacrifice's echo became") and template cadence runs in the naming sequence ("She channeled... whispering... The scattered light intensified... One sea monster solidified... 'Krathor,' she named it"). Filter-verb reliance ("felt," "watched") appears frequently but does not reach stacking threshold. Density suffers from decorative phrasing that restates emotional state rather than advancing cause.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive label loops ("lukewarm," "earnestly naive," "brittle devotion") and paraphrase cycles (devotion "teetered on shattering; one doubt, and it would crumble" then "devotion's fragility forging strength" then "brittle devotion tempered to resilient vow") stall momentum across the middle third. Template cadence runs: "He unpacked… He etched… He heated…" and "Elowen knelt… Elowen's hands shook… Elowen slumped" in uniform subject-verb stems. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh inflection: "faulty lanterns," "half-hearted candle flames," "beggar's promise." These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("naive heart swelled," "dripping precision"), diluting the final image's charge. Apply −1.2 cumulative in Q7 for loops, stems, and stock phrasing; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "hush" and its variants appear eight times, "sapphire" six times, "precisely humane" three times, often in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("The ridgeway... The hush... The trail...") and filter-verb stacks ("spotted," "knelt," "lifted," "turned") dull immediacy. Figurative language clusters in non-pressure beats ("twilight bled into the ridgeway's midnight veil") without pattern-teaching. The final third repeats closure gestures ("whole," "peace," "grace") in summary rather than scene. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.2)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence stacks metaphor or elevated descriptor ("prismatic spray scattering rainbows across the hidden orchard like forgotten jewels from an ancient dawn," "veins of wonder," "vortex of feathers and foresight"). Template cadence is evident in the middle third: "First, a spiral... Then, a blooming flower... The patterns shifted: a bridge..." reads as outline scaffold. Paraphrase loops appear: "touch of wonder" is invoked four times without functional shift, and "ancient freshness" bookends the piece as thematic flag rather than earned image. The density cap (figurative language in most sentences without payoff) triggers −0.6, and the template-cadence run adds −0.5; artifacts touch the closure beat ("touch of wonder descended," "harmonized at last"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    Patterned artifacts pervade: "soundless echo" recurs as a fixed phrase across the opening, middle, and close without variation; "the watcher's burden" and "muscle memory" loop similarly. The final third fragments into single-line paragraphs with paraphrase loops ("Patterns held. / Trust preserved. / Echo faded to hush. / Vigil absolute. / Endured.") that restate closure without added density. Template cadence (repeated "X, Y" constructions) and synonym churn ("revision," "revise," "revised") dull momentum. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the elevated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Clarity remains intact, preventing a causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.4)
    Heavy scaffold and paraphrase loops: "complementary opposites" is restated three times within four lines at the climax; "pretense" recurs mechanically across beats without evolving pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "Kai—no longer survivor alone, but dyad," "Custody battle etched," "No more void; only vibrant now," "The end." Stock metaphors ("ink in water," "clouds parting") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the rock's pulse") dull immediacy. Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without coherent vehicles—mixed metaphors like "sigils that bound opposites" and "tendrils extruding, reforming." Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece suffers from pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence stacks metaphor or elevated diction ("macerating the household's petrified griefs, softening their brittle husks," "winds eroding years of buried resentments"). Template cadence recurs—"Mournfully eager" appears three times as a stem, and multiple sentences open with participial phrases describing simultaneous actions. Paraphrase loops appear: "the unspoken" and "unspoken griefs" are restated across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. These artifacts cluster in the climax, dulling propulsion. Register drift into abstract philosophical vocabulary ("polyphony," "acoustic haze") clashes with the ghostly focalizer's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphor and elevated diction in nearly every sentence ("frost to fragile thoughts," "light pooled in safe geometries," "roots in my gut"). This creates a relentless lyric texture that flattens momentum rather than modulating with scene pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "interiorizing" is repeated across multiple beats with minimal variation in effect. The final sequence ("I stepped toward home, the frozen garden folding into my being, a friend forged in fog") stacks metaphors without clear spatial or causal grounding, obscuring the closure action. Template cadence is visible in repeated "I [verb]" constructions across the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.8)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked ("dying fires converged in a crystalline hush, frozen blooms of ash and glow hung suspended like petals trapped in eternal winter"), creating register drift that slows momentum. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "stoically sensitive" echoes across beats without development, and the three approximation paragraphs follow identical syntactic templates ("First approximation:... Second approximation:... Third approximation:"). Template cadence (−0.5), mixed metaphors in the opening (frozen fire, crystalline hush), and scaffolding phrases ("with stoic precision," "his sensitive soul") reduce information density and dull the closure beat (−0.8 total; artifacts touch closure, so disallow 9+ globally per penalty pack).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance action or setting. Rhythm varies appropriately (short bursts during the climb, longer syntactic units during the tuning). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "Assumptions cluttered reception…she'd learned to shed them" is immediately followed by restating the same idea. Template cadence runs in the discard-assumptions sequence ("Next, old linguist codes… Shed city-fall bitterness… Deeper: discard faith"). The Hollywood star fragment's "thrummed serenely electric" and "etched with faded script" repeat the same concept across adjacent beats. The meta-comment "[Adjusting precision.] No, precise count holds. [Story complete.]" is a visible scaffold artifact. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for the scaffold token totaling −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose carries several text-pattern artifacts: paraphrase loops ("passengers murmured in confusion" followed immediately by overlapping doubles; "ferry solidified" then "hull gleaming anew"), template cadence ("He raced…He lifted…He dashed"), and synonym churn around "permanent transient." Figurative density is high without clear payoff—"spectral flow," "binding filigree," "phantom sands"—muddling clarity in peak beats. The final third summarizes rather than propelling ("Back at dock, clocks ticked true…The end of the shift brought weary joy"), flattening momentum. Grammar and sequence are clean, but information density suffers from repeated thematic claims.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.3)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and stock metaphor strings. "Memories flickered... altering subtly" / "As memories altered further" / "Memories shifted again" / "memories altered into a mosaic" recurs without added pressure—synonym churn across adjacent beats (−0.6). Template cadence in the final third: "He paused... He began... He wove... He touched... He knotted... He released" (−0.4). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching payoff: "optical illusion gallery," "translucent sinew thread," "rational enchantments," "fever's forge," "arterial spray frozen in time" crowd single beats, blurring rather than sharpening (−0.5 for density without coherence). Stock phrasing: "held its breath," "stepped into the night." Total artifact load: −1.5 plus touching closure region (final third) disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "wondrous in its vast implications, yet tinged with melancholy" / "somber marvel" / "promise and peril intertwined" all restate the same tonal claim without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs: "She neither rushed… nor shunned, but probed…" Stock metaphors cluster: "living constellations," "veils," "petals." The final paragraph contains a visible scaffold artifact: "[Actually, ending here, but count adjusts.] Wait, precise:…" Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy ("see here," "leaned in," "eyes widened"). Synonym churn: "horizons" / "veils" / "rifts" cycle without adding density.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "mist-clad atrium" recurs in the opening and closing without evolution, and "vulnerable voices" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is pervasive: "Elara [verb]" stems run through at least five sentences in the peak beat. Stock metaphors cluster in the atrium scenes ("shadows pooling like forgotten sighs," "mist swirling around her like ghosts"). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she'd traced") stack in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure third, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is moderate; some lines advance multiple jobs, but scaffold sentences ("Her motivation burned deep") summarize rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but patterned artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("The passage narrowed, forcing her belly to stone" / "Ahead, bioluminescent kelp swayed"), template stems ("She squeezed through," "She stepped forward," "She'd returned"), and synonym churn for "hush" (crashing hush × 4). The final third stacks exposition ("lead tech murmured," "her colleagues, translucent, eyes pleading," "Facility forgotten no more") that summarizes rather than dramatizes the peak encounter. Stock metaphors appear: "walls closing in like a vice," "damp fingers," "heart hammering." Clarity remains high, preventing deeper penalty, but density and propulsion slip in expository beats.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries significant scaffold and paraphrase loops: "midnight solace" appears five times, often redundantly ("her voice soft in the tone of midnight solace"; "Midnight solace lingered"). Synonym churn is evident ("the ghost's hoard" / "lessons from the experiment's ruin"; "shattered" / "fractured" / "scarred"). Template cadence runs: "Her X guided her… / Elara's fingers… / The porcelain shard…" in sequence. Mixed metaphor: ink "spilled in ephemeral patterns, swirling like nebulae" then "whispered commands"—liquid, visual, auditory vehicles clash. The phrase "after the radio static cleared" in paragraph 9 creates a redundant loop with "Static roared… then abruptly cleared." Information density is moderate but momentum drags through repetitive affirming beats in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed results: "towers of bone thrust skyward like the ribs of ancient leviathans" is vivid, but "words that lingered like mist" and "silk of wind, the bite of frost" cluster into stock poetic gestures. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Thorne's people once spoke... But across the death... Thorne, driven to translate... One dusk, in the fractured base..." (repeated "[Noun/Name], [participial phrase]" openings). Paraphrase loops surface: "the core concept of the tunnel revealed itself: echoes not as mere reflections, but as living patterns" is immediately followed by "to harness the tunnel's echoes through the flawed diamond, transforming the language's lost textures into undying soundscapes"—two adjacent sentences restating mechanism. The climactic sequence narrates transformation ("Grit became gravelly bass tones; silk wove into shimmering harmonics") rather than dramatizing Thorne's real-time adjustments, flattening propulsion. Clarity remains high, but information density sags under ornamental repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "Her brother's voice broke through" / "Brother, my bitterness was the heaviest stone" restate the same plea. Template cadence runs appear—"The arrowhead pulsed…as if it remembered" / "The arrowhead blazed, and she felt it"—with identical stems. Stock metaphors ("frostbitten void," "spider silk," "quicksilver") cluster without fresh vehicle. Mixed metaphor: "bitterness festered like blackroot blight" then "became the setup for laughter"—blight and joke are incoherent vehicles. Figurative density in the final third obscures propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are evident: "gap between knowing and understanding" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "resonantly soft" recurs as label without evolving function. Template cadence in the climax—"Statues converged… too late. Elara descended… in a rush… she knelt… she began to uproot"—reads as outline beats rather than propulsive prose. Mixed metaphor: "violin string stretched taut" for the sky-bridge, then "violin weeping triumph" personifies the instrument inconsistently. Stock phrase "fire of her unyielding motivation" and "tarnished wonder" (repeated at open and close without transformation) add to density of artifacts. Apply −1.2 for loops, template stems, and stock phrasing across multiple beats; the final paragraph contains artifacts, triggering the 9+ disqualifier and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "veins under bruised skin," "gaping like unmet eyes," "thunderstorm's breath," "cobalt ghosts approving." Mixed metaphors accumulate (the bottle births micro-storms yet also has "rage" and "fury"). Paraphrase loops appear ("absences linked," "by linking absences," "absences chained"). Template cadence in the final third ("He'd crossed once... drones were surer now"; "Respectfully rebellious, he played...") flattens propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("promises stirring beyond," "bottled vow unbound"), triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is lyrical with strong imagery ("star-pricked skies," "velvet stillness"), but figurative density in high-pressure beats borders on overwriting: nearly every sentence in the oasis discovery deploys metaphor or elevated diction without breathing room. Paraphrase loops appear: "silence as possibility" and "interpreting silence" recur across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in repetitive phrase openings ("Quietly persistent," "He moved," "Elias paused/froze/knelt"). The "song wove into the misting hush, notes of wood and whimsy" mixes metaphors (song as thread, then as notes). Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance. Minor artifacts in the final third ("whispering gleams of futures yet unspun") dull closure slightly. Overall, the prose is accomplished but not disciplined enough for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose carries vivid sensory detail and controlled rhythm in descriptive passages, but pervasive scaffold and template cadence accumulate across the piece: "Eliza's eccentricity shone sanely" / "Sanely, Eliza noted"; "In that place where stories lived" / "The place where stories live beckoned"; "Patrons browsed on" / "Patrons would browse unaware"; "observed solitude" appears four times as a thematic tag without evolving function. Paragraph-length one-line fragments in the final third ("Tomorrow's odd hours called, geometry her guide." / "Patrons would browse unaware, as ever.") create rhythmic monotony rather than purposeful compression. Figurative language is dense ("horocycle's embrace," "pseudospherical model," "hyperbolic branches") but much of it decorates rather than advances pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "analog memories demanded physical resurrection, not simulation" is immediately followed by "analog memories reawakening through the geometric warp," restating the same claim. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, lowering clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is extreme: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats deploys metaphor ("tendrils of pink," "luminous absence," "drinking the dawn," "vitalization poured forth"). Mixed metaphors abound—light "chasing" absence, winds "weaving tales," palette wells "depleting" yet "glowing"—and register drift into archaic/poetic diction ("apex," "vitalize," "perched eternal") clashes with the physical tasks. Template cadence: "She climbed… She painted… She developed…" runs across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops: the dream is described as fleeing/elusive/darting/taunting in adjacent lines without added pressure. No clarity break at closure, but pervasive overwriting and scaffold ("Each brushstroke mapped… channeling… into swirling vortices") dull momentum. Apply artifact penalties: −1.0 for density and coherence issues, −0.4 for template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "improbable longing" appears six times, "enveloped secrets" five, "shadowed nexus under starlight" three, "across the hush of cosmic possibility" four. Template cadence runs in the final section: "Longing improbable, yet achingly real. Across hush unending, locksmith's enigma endured. Starlight bore witness, hints forever given." Stock metaphors—"secrets spilling forth like nebulae," "ideas freed danced like fireflies"—appear in peak beats without fresh specificity. The final third is a sequence of summary fragments with no propulsion. Artifacts touch closure; baseline −1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in sensory passages. Minor template cadence in the opening paragraph: multiple "his [noun]" constructions cluster without variation. One paraphrase loop: the paragraph beginning "Memories flickered" and the next both recount the memory-recovery mechanism. The final meta-commentary ("But the count must adjust...") is a generation artifact that should be excised but does not obscure the closure beat itself. Figurative language is controlled and mostly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong imagery. However, paraphrase loops appear: "combative tenderness" is restated four times across the text, and "quiet mentorship" recurs without evolution. Template cadence in the middle third: "She'd rebuilt... She'd shaped... Her work..." Stock metaphors ("steel spine," "quiet forge," "caring fire") cluster in high-pressure beats without fresh specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("watched... seeing") dull immediacy. No loops or artifacts touch the closure paragraph directly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dense figurative language pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "upon the hush of budding hope," "dawn's first light kissed the mist," "storm-torn petals," "hope incarnate." Template cadence appears in runs of parallel structures ("From the waterfall... Then from the verdant parapet... From the orchards"). Paraphrase loops occur: "preserve that color" / "the vibrant hue" / "the color of wonder" recur across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("thread of calm," "beacon against the fade") and label-only interiority ("insatiably creative") cluster in peak beats. Information density is low—many sentences restate stakes or describe without advancing causality. Clarity is maintained, but momentum drags under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "interlaced hush," "accumulating silence," "centuries-old fisherman's net," and "lucid unrest" recur without reweighting. Template cadence dominates the middle third ("A faint moan escaped," "The second spirit burst forth," "Hours bled as the shade shared more"). Filter verbs ("perceived," "gazed," "felt") stack in high-pressure beats where immediacy is needed. Figurative density is high but often mixed: "silence accumulated, pooling like ink" competes with "hush's residue" and "silence dispersing like mist." The final beat ("lucid unrest evolved to quiet resolve") summarizes rather than shows. Information density is low; many lines restate the core concept without advancing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "methodically curious" appears three times, "shielded openness" four times, "empathy/empathetic" six times, often in adjacent or near-adjacent lines without added pressure. Synonym churn is visible in the vault's description ("rain-scoured fresco vault," "the vault's indifferent frescoes," "the vault's shadowed alcoves," "back in the vault that evening") and the chapel's acoustics ("whispers," "murmurs," "hush," "silence"). Figurative density at key beats—"rain lashed the windscreen, mirroring the vault's scourge"; "the henge above thrummed with wind, as if the chapel exhaled long-held breath"—muddles clarity with mixed metaphors. The closure paragraph stacks summary assertions ("Now, known embraced unknown, silence interpreted with empathy's gentle touch") instead of propelling through image, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb and template-cadence rules.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe overwriting in figurative density: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries metaphor or simile without pattern-teaching ("whispers of a century-lost voyage," "gelatinous archive of human ambition drowned," "velvet shadow murmuring probabilities"). Mixed metaphors appear ("threads bind us to the plunge" vs. "filaments mirroring narrative snarls"). Paraphrase loops: the concept of letting go is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence: repeated "she [verb]" and "Elara's [noun]" sentence stems. Register drift into academic jargon ("Schrödinger's wave of probability") clashes with the POV's immediate situation. These artifacts touch the closure beat (−1.7 baseline penalty in Q7, plus disallow 9+ globally per patterned-artifact rule).

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant patterned artifacts cluster throughout: "driftingly alert" appears three times, "tinkersong wonder" four times, "seldom-heard" twice, "messages encoded in graffiti art" twice—all as template labels without evolution. Paraphrase loops are evident: "a ghost in code, a digital specter" and "encode the ghost's essence into a master ballad-script" restate the same concept. Sentence stems repeat: "Elowen [verb]" opens multiple consecutive lines in the climax paragraph. Figurative density (swirling vines, living ink, pixelated mist, code-streams arcing skyward) packs nearly every sentence without breathing room, reducing clarity. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("tinkersong wonder eternal"), triggering the elevated penalty and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe line-level issues: the metafictional aside ("Wait, too many—trimming in mind…[599—error, recount: full tally 712 now adjusted.]") is scaffolding left on the page and destroys immersion. Paraphrase loops abound: "anguish spilled forth" / "more torment unfolded" / "anguish dominated still" / "anguish peaked." Stock metaphors cluster: "iron-willed," "joy snatched from duty's jaws," "frozen dagger," "captive auroras." Figurative density in the opening paragraph (icebound spire, frozen dagger, glass-walled, frost-laced, ice-veined, prismatic, captive auroras) overloads without pattern-teaching. Template cadence: "Third floor: anguish… Fourth floor: more torment… Fifth floor: Lira deciphered… Sixth floor: Lira smiled… Seventh floor: the diary's core…" —seven consecutive structural parallels without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language ("dusty starlight," "quietly explosive," "spooled wholeness") saturates most sentences, creating a consistent lyric texture but reducing clarity and propulsion in high-pressure beats. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("Cumulus towers brooded…"; "Nacreous clouds shimmered…"; "Altocumulus: flirtatious whimsy…"). Paraphrase loops recur: "spooled wholeness" is restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing meaning. The prose is rhythmically controlled but momentum sags under metaphoric density; the origami-release beat is clean, yet scaffold phrases ("He adjusted the telescope," "Elias lowered the telescope") pad transitions. Line-level artifacts in the final third (e.g., "spooling her eternally") blur the closure image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is generally high, and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Sentence rhythm varies, though several beats repeat "fractally precise" as a talisman (five instances) without functional variation. The phrase "heightened stillness" appears three times, and "hush" recurs without reweighting. Mid-story, synonym churn surfaces: "meticulous layers," "unflinching accuracy," "infinite detail" cycle through similar semantic space. The closure sequence tightens momentum, but earlier paragraphs stack filter verbs ("she sought," "she deciphered," "she confronted") and template stems ("Her fingers traced," "Her hands... moved," "Her blindness... freed her") that dull immediacy. One paraphrase loop: "Elara's breath slowed further, syncing with the tree's pulse" followed by "With scavenged guild tools... Elara began to craft" restates the transition without adding pressure. Apply −0.8 for template cadence, paraphrase, and stock-phrase recurrence across multiple beats; the artifacts touch the middle third but not the closure image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "stranded luminance, ethereal light trapped in crystalline motes, shimmering like captured starlight" stacks three metaphors for the same glow; "sociable isolation a comforting veil" and "her sociable chatter warding off the creeping loneliness" are paraphrase loops of the same trait. Template cadence runs appear: "Let's see...," "Ha! You're...," "Sociable skies..." with performed cheer as filler. The phrase "diligently curious" recurs six times across narration, and "sociable/sociably" appears eight times, creating synonym churn. Figurative density in the opening two paragraphs (murmurations as "symphonic roar," "hypnotic dance," "undulating waves") slows momentum before the inciting object appears. The core action sequence (brush dust, match symbols, press palm) is clear but wrapped in scaffolding that restates her traits and the glow's beauty without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density pervades high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching: "sighs," "driftwood nostalgia," "brass worlds," "shattered dial," "spectral motes," "fireflies in the glare," "prismatic ghosts" cluster without adding distinct pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("The prophecies had warned… The prophecies rustled… The prophecies had led true"), and paraphrase loops recur ("breath crystallizing… exhale a whisper," "frozen heart… freeze"). Mixed metaphor: "driftwood nostalgia" (tangible flotsam) paired with "sighs" (intangible sound) and "warmed him… as anchor" (thermal + nautical) blurs coherence. These artifacts touch closure ("driftwood nostalgia warmed him"), triggering the elevated Q7 penalty and the global 9+ disqualifier.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence dominates the middle: "Elara urged… Kael grumbled… Mira replied… Thorne nodded" stacks identical subject-verb stems without variation. Paraphrase loops recur ("strangers became family" appears three times; "strangely trustworthy" is repeated verbatim). Figurative density in the opening—"bramble-fruited trees twisted beneath floating rock arches suspended in lavender skies, a nebula of respite shimmered"—is never motivated by POV or pressure, reading as décor. The climax compresses crucial action into summary ("they orchestrated the collective effort") instead of dramatizing hands, breath, and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence—"dusk bled bruised purple," "time's final ripple," "flawed ember"—creating a dense, lyric texture that occasionally tips into overwriting; multiple metaphor vehicles (ripples, nests, veins, galaxies) crowd the middle paragraphs without clear hierarchy. Template cadence appears in repeated "through" and "as" constructions. Paraphrase loops are minimal, and grammar is clean, but information density is low: many lines reiterate mood rather than advancing situation. The closure beat ("the lighthouse fading into dusk's eternal embrace") lands clearly, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several loops and scaffold patterns appear: "Reluctance clawed… reluctance fading… Reluctance returned" cycles the same concept without adding pressure. "Per blueprint" appears multiple times with near-identical construction. "Graceless" and its variants recur in adjacent beats ("gracelessly," "graceless beauty," "graceless runes") without pattern-teaching or payoff beyond motif-tagging. The metaphor density in the opening third is high ("dangled like forgotten regrets," "paths buckled like drunken veins," "winds howled like thwarted lovers") without clear escalation or coherent vehicle logic. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, −0.4 for overwriting in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative density is high and occasionally muddles: "symphonically minded approach to molecular bonds" in the opener sets a metaphor that recurs without clear constraint on action. Paraphrase loops appear ("grief had loosened… grief loosened further… grief fully loosened") and template cadence runs ("He'd been blind… he saw… he would return… he sketched… he stood"). The coda's summary mode ("Tests confirmed… Months later… deployed… restored") stacks scaffold sentences. Overwriting in peak beats (foam "danced in ephemeral lattices, bubbles diverging in frothy divergence") reduces propulsion. Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for elevated register drift in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high and consistent, fitting the lyric mode; most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction ("parole beginning to glimmer," "narrative foam"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "mindfully scattered" recurs without reweighting, and "fragmentation/integrated" toggles mechanically across paragraphs. Template cadence in the final third ("Elias vanished... Somewhere, a clean slate vendor's shop stood empty... They'd buy slates...") flattens propulsion. The ending lists outcomes rather than dramatizing a single charged image, diluting closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies across short and longer sentences, and sensory detail is vivid. However, persistent text artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("sturdy brittle reality" echoed in "sturdy resolve holding his fragility," then "sturdy, unbrittle sheen"), template cadence in the pavilion sequence ("He knelt… Tasting it… He gasped… He unpacked… He drew samples…" six consecutive subject-verb stems), and stock metaphors ("like spilled ink," "like lead," "like captured moonlight"). The phrase "remorse stored deep like salt in cured meat" is specific and voice-apt, but "stored remorse" recurs six times without variation, flattening momentum. The climactic pool-by-pool smoothing is summarized in a list ("Pool by pool, he progressed") rather than dramatized with distinct obstacles. Propulsion stalls in the middle third, where scaffolding ("These weren't random; the pavilion stored remorse") tells what the prior sentences already showed. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: template cadence and paraphrase loops touching multiple beats warrant −0.6 to −0.8 in Q7; stock metaphor clusters add another −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "borrowed starlight," "silent titans," "comet tails," "fertile tomorrows," and "silos eternal" cluster without payoff, creating register drift (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear ("rehabilitate the talks, restoring their spirit" / "rehabilitated grain elevator talks"; "vigorous tender" × 4), triggering the template-cadence penalty (−0.6). The montage paragraph beginning "Hours earlier" compresses bridge-building into a synonym chain ("rallied crews," "stirred reluctant hands," "cables taut," "spans connected") that obscures causal sequencing. Stock metaphors ("woven voices," "fragile arc of unity") and therapy-speak ("empathetically decisive") touch the closure beat, escalating the artifact deduction to −1.0 total and disqualifying 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy template cadence: "Elara's [noun]," "The [noun] [verb]," "Chaotically precise" recur across a dozen lines, creating drumbeat monotony. Paraphrase loops proliferate ("synaptic plasticity" restated five times; "profound transformation" four times; "entangled memories" three times). Figurative density ("helix," "entangled," "quaking," "cascaded") appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring cause/effect at the closure beat. Artifacts touch the ending ("transformation complete"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy overwriting: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language ("mist coiling like forgotten thoughts," "latent blaze simmered in her veins," "seeds of vigilance flowered fully") without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity and momentum (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear (paragraphs on "seeds of vigilance" restate the same concept across multiple beats; −0.4). Template cadence runs in the middle third ("She traced…feeling…" / "She reached…touching…" / "She swam…reentering…"; −0.5). Stock metaphors and register drift into pseudo-mystical abstraction pervade peak beats. Information density is low; many lines describe rather than advance. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and sensory details are vivid ("creamy glaze cracked but iridescent," "fine fissures like veins of suppressed melody"), but pervasive loop and template issues drag momentum: "empathy in motion" appears three times, "symphonically minded" five times, and variations of "stress cracks" recur across adjacent lines without added pressure. Sentence openings vary but exhibit runs of subject-verb stems ("Elowen lifted," "Elowen drew," "Elowen strummed"). The final paragraph stacks generic transitions ("He rose, pocketing…departed as…leaving…forever") that summarize rather than dramatize. These artifacts do not obscure causality but measurably dull the closure image, warranting deductions in the −1.2 range and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is legible and carries vivid imagery ("twilight bled purple," "compasses spun wild," "stars pricked the velvet sky"). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or elevated diction, creating density without corresponding pressure gain. Mixed vehicles appear ("eclipsed covenant," "Morse of magnetic whispers," "queen's gambit withheld" as silence descriptor). Template cadence clusters in the final third: "The monoliths shuddered; a low hum rose... The covenant stirred... The world's beauty lay..." Paraphrase loops recur ("melancholy tugging... hope flickered"; "magnetic nexus faded... pact tentatively renewed... pressed on"). These patterns dull momentum and touch the closure beat, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "release your secrets, that we may honor this hush" is immediately restated as "coaxing it open like a flower to dawn." Template cadence runs dominate ("he noted," "he turned," "he positioned," "he adjusted," "he began") without variation (−0.6). Mixed metaphors: "silence pulsed like a held breath" then "cool air scented by…distant gunpowder" (breath/scent vehicle clash). Figurative density in most sentences of the tuning beat ("deep indigo for tension, shimmering gold for release," "Morse code of resistance," "earth's heartbeat") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Stock phrasing: "his eclectic soul humming a melody born of intuition."

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern payoff ("hidden sap," "tidal wave crashing her awareness," "odor a tidal wave"). Template cadence runs ("Days blurred… her nose tracking… Yet she doodled… Villagers whispered… But Elara pressed on") span multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops: "serenity eluded her" / "serenity meant blooming amid chaos" / "she had cultivated serenity." Baseline −1.2 in Q7 for density + coherence + template stems; artifacts touch closure beats, adding −0.5. Total artifact penalty −1.7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short crisis beats, longer discovery paragraph). Clarity is generally strong, though some constructions blur sequence: "Drawn inexorably, she furled her glider and dropped into the flow, tumbling into the chamber's heart" compresses three actions without causal connectors. The phrase "whirling silence" appears four times, becoming a template cadence that dulls rather than charges (−0.4). "Gaunt cheeks tightened" and "motivation burned hotter" are stock embodiments. Figurative density is high but controlled except for "rivers...threading through...like liquid starlight" and "ancient ribs," which remain legible. Information density is solid; no major loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy use of templated phrasing and repeated key terms without pattern-teaching: "singular convergence" appears five times, "rapidly adapting" four times, "cultivate foresight" three times, "hazy precision" twice—often as label drops rather than evolved motifs. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third (wind documentation beats rephrase the same data-collection action). Several runs of "Elias + past-tense verb" sentence stems ("Elias surveyed," "Elias moved," "Elias stood," "Elias exited") create template cadence without voice justification. Stock metaphors ("loomed like urban canyons," "engines howling like banshees") appear without fresh inflection. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance plot while others loop. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("foresight sown"), triggering the Q7 cap disqualification for 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences ("prism-song," "honeyed sunlight preserved in resin," "sculpted hush," "oscillating repose") without pattern-teaching or cost, creating density that slows rather than propels. Multiple synonym loops and paraphrases appear: "sculpted hush, silence not mere absence but meticulously chiseled," then "the cavern's hush," then "hush now a partner in reposeful oscillation." Template cadence runs through participial openers and "she [verb]" stems. Key closure beats ("she had certified it: wonder was essential") rely on telling rather than image. Artifacts touch the closure, triggering penalties per the guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.2)
    Repetitive phrasing and template cadence pervade: "canyon hush" appears six times, "driven" three times in identical constructions, "avalanchingly quiet" twice with the same syntax. Paraphrase loops cluster—"The guardianship had ended in ruin" / "after the guardianship" / "the guardianship's end"—restating status without advancing pressure. Filter-verb stacks in the middle third ("he recalled," "he drew," "he positioned") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors—"weight of memory," "wound that festered," "sound threads spun outward"—accumulate without fresh vehicle logic. The final paragraph recycles stems: "Elaron cased... markers already crumbling... Driven no longer... turned homeward" in list-like sequence. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant patterned artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences ("Disoriented, he printed furiously" / "Mira, now fully his mirror, assisted"), template cadence with repetitive stems ("He handed her," "He had designed," "He grabbed"), and stock metaphor strings ("ink on wet paper," "molten topaz"). Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt the pull," "saw the stars' vanishing," "understood"). The final third contains decorative sentence fragments ("Topaz gleamed eternally. Between vanishings, truth endured.") that add texture without advancing causality. These issues materially dull the closure image and trigger the artifact penalty pack with global 9+ disallowance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective, but multiple prose artifacts cluster: paraphrase loops ("absent mentor whose voice echoed only in faded memories" / "Now, across the fade from memory to myth, Thorne's tales blurred"), thesaurus churn ("coax," "germinate," "vibrate sympathetically" recur as conceptual synonyms), and template cadence in the closing third ("Auroras danced on, eternal witnesses. / The pendant's vibration lingered... / Thorne's absence? A seed... / Kael pressed on..."). Stock metaphors ("cracking like dry leaves," "seeds in thawed soil") appear in high-pressure beats. Generation-scaffold artifacts ("germinates," "sympathetically," "across the fade") recur mechanically. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for artifact spread touching closure; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense (frost as neural maps, mist as serpents, prism as unanswered questions). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "shifted hush" is repeated nearly identically across paragraphs without pressure increase; "firmly grounded" recurs as scaffold; "attentive mystic" and "quartz arbor" are restated in nearly identical phrasing. Template cadence in the middle third ("He [verb], [object]" x3). Stock metaphors like "boot of truth," "soul's vast sea," "bridge" for voice, and "vault" for memory reduce specificity. The closure image (gold flecks, prism in hand) is vivid, but purple prose in peak beats ("mist coiling like serpents," "quartz sang softly") slightly obscures propulsion. Minor filter-verb stacks ("he knew," "he told," "he smiled") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe patterned artifacts: "the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" appears three times, "raveling silence" / "raveled" / "raveling" five times, and "stoically sparkling" three times without evolving function—textbook loops that dull the closure image. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "She carried… She strung… She wove… She recommenced…" Figurative density is high but incoherent: "rotted sweetly" (olfactory contradiction), "silence… stoically sparkling" (mixed sense metaphor), "threads loosening like whispers dying on the wind" (stacked simile obscuring the tenor). Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraphs 6–7 (puzzle edges as keys to patterns, then edges forming a border). Apply −1.4 baseline in Q7 for pervasive artifacts; escalate to −1.7 because loops touch the closure beat ("raveling silence deepened," "silence fully raveled"). Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact penalty pack. Additionally, filter-verb stack in final third ("felt her essence fray," "absorbed her woven plea") adds −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "sparks flying like defiant stars," "veins of forgotten picks," "silk humming against calluses like distant wind." In peak beats (shaft awakening, final emergence), metaphor stacks without rest—"azure defiance flaring," "echoes building like forge bellows," "train of floating sentinels"—creating register drift and reducing clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "deliberately" recurs five times, "quietly determined" and "meek" echo without added pressure. Template cadence in closing paragraphs: "Arches stabilized… fruits swelled… roots delving… whispers spread… Elar returned… orchards thrived…" reads as summary checklist. Information density is uneven; the shaft sequence advances pressure, but the final third summarizes outcomes rather than sustaining propulsion.

    Paraphrase loops appear: "cyclically spontaneous" recurs as label across four paragraphs without adding pressure; "the weight of truth" is synonym-churned ("truth's weight," "truth's heft," "weight of a withheld truth"). Template cadence is evident in repeated "She [verb]" openers and "In the [noun], [subject] [verb]" constructions. Figurative density is high ("nocturnal flowers," "worn fabric," "verdant fire") but much of it ornaments rather than advances; mixed metaphor in "truth's weight...crushing" then "a steady hum, not a chain" blurs sense. Baseline −1.0 penalty for loops and template stems in Q7; artifacts touch closure ("weaver eternal"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose opens with vivid images ("waves clawed," "jagged cliffs," "dying heartbeat") and maintains clarity through most beats. However, the final paragraph disintegrates into visible generation artifacts: bracketed notes ("Wait, recount precisely later," "No, must hit 600-800," "[Over]"), false starts ("No—that exceeded," "Adjust," "But core intact"), and meta-commentary on word count. These scaffold fragments pervade the closure beat, obscuring the final image and violating the Text-Artifact rule. Applying the Patterned-Artifact Penalty Pack: baseline −1.4 for spread, escalated to −1.7 because artifacts touch closure, plus the disallow-9+ cap and 8.8 high-band cap. Minor additional issues: "luminescent ache" is abstract rather than concrete, and "bottle the feeling of safety" recurs as a phrase without embodied variation. Rounding down yields 4.2.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose demonstrates control of rhythm and figurative language ("velvet sky," "photons in eternal loops") but suffers from density imbalance and loop artifacts. Synonym churn is visible: "shadowed elation" appears three times, "laughter" / "chuckle" / "giggled" / "crowed" / "chortled" recur without variation in function. Template cadence emerges in the climax: "He leaned closer... As he aligned... Elias's laughter erupted... He gripped the levers..." (sequential action stems). Mixed metaphors appear ("tempest's mischievous kin," "forge for the new dawn" layered with "veil" and "beacon's altered song"). Information density is uneven—several sentences restate triumph and shadow-arrival. These artifacts do not break causality but dull momentum in the final third, triggering −0.9 for patterned artifacts and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is lyric and rhythmically controlled, but overwriting and template cadence accumulate. Runs of figurative language in adjacent sentences ("dew on spider silk," "moths to lantern glow," "fermenting toward burst," "prisms," "velvet blue") without causal linkage trigger density penalty. Repeated noun-phrase structures ("the donor, a legendary tale-weaver"; "the gift, quietly explosive"; "the caution sang clearer") and recycled prompt phrases ("quietly explosive," "iridescent caution," "valley-mist wonder") create template feel. Paraphrase loops appear: "stories clung to her" / "tales... drawing her" / "stories magnetized to her" / "narratives... orbiting" across early paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks ("noted how," "tracked," "traced") are voice-consistent but dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("heartbeats syncing with the tales yet to unfold"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "moonlight silvered the puddles," "sorrow not vast and poetic but precisely measured," "dreams drifted through the labyrinth like motes"—figurative language appears in most sentences without taught pattern or payoff, triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops are visible: "he spotted it: an astronomer's broken sextant" immediately followed by "The instrument, relic of a stargazer lost to madness," restating the same content (−0.2). Template cadence runs: "First, the main arc… Next, the telescope tube… Deeper into the night, he ventured" (−0.5). Register drift into elevated diction ("quantified sorrow," "ephemeral wisps," "lunar essence") clashes with the POV's grounded maintenance-worker role in peak beats (−0.4). Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Clarity remains mostly intact, but momentum is dulled by scaffold and ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed ("veins of glowing sap," "bark like bruised skin," "molten dawnlight")—most images are legible, but the accumulation risks overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "Shadows howled, the bound night fracturing" immediately followed by "Endless night peeled back in veils" restates the same shift. Template cadence is light but present: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "Elara [verb]." Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere more than plot. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, capping deductions under the non-closure cap. Propulsion is steady but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "compassionate recluse" appears three times, "nestled paradoxes" four times, "crumpled" six times across invitation and fears. Template cadence dominates exposition ("Her keenly empathetic nature allowed…," "That error haunted her…," "Now, driven by that very regret…"). Stock metaphors ("beacon of quietude," "whispered secrets," "bloomed into sagacity") accumulate without earning resonance. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the paradox," "recognized the seal," "felt her guidance") dull immediacy in peak beats (−1.2 baseline; −0.5 additional for filter stacks in high-pressure moments; total artifacts touch closure, triggering the 9+ disallow).

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries metaphoric density ("frost etched the leaves silver," "steam curl like confessions") and some vivid particulars (solar-heated brazier, chipped pot), but suffers from scaffold loops, template cadence, and register drift. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "creeping normality had lulled him too" immediately follows his reflection on the same concept. Runs of identical stems ("He ate slowly… He poured… He watched") create drumbeat rhythm. Stock phrases ("yeast ghosts," "fertile canvas," "small salvations") cluster in high-pressure beats. Filter-verb stacks ("He saw potential," "He felt it settle") dull immediacy. Figurative language in most sentences of the reconciliation beat—without pattern-teaching or payoff—triggers overwriting penalties. These artifacts touch the closure image ("the sacred ordinary pulsing anew"), disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "illusions faded to memory" appears four times; "gently meticulous" three times; "luminous vows" six times; "quartz hush" recurs as both anchor and filler. Template cadence runs: "Elias [verb], [object]" structures dominate without variation. Figurative language ("dying stars," "divining rod," "cloud-forged silver") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without clarity. The ending beat—"order triumphed gently"—is abstracted rather than image-driven. Mixed metaphors (vows as stars, waves, melody) blur sensory coherence. Artifact penalty: −1.2 total in Q7; loops and stems touch closure. Disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies across beats, and information density is generally high, but several patterns recur: "curiously steadfast" appears three times, "comforting unease" twice, and "truce of hush" is restated in multiple forms across paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("the market pulsed with life" / "Lila circled back"; "Hours waned; the sea whispered warnings as the first pink streak teased the horizon" / "By sunrise, Lila vanished into the dunes"). Stock pirate-market descriptors ("tattooed vendors," "cursed compasses," "Jolly Rogers") cluster without fresh specificity. Grammar and syntax are clean, and the opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively, but the template cadence and synonym churn in the middle third dull momentum. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and label recurrence combined.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with figurative language—nearly every sentence in the bluff sequence carries metaphor or compound modification—but coherence suffers: "terrestrially cosmic" is semantically contradictory, "emergent needle blazing" mixes scales, and "luminescing into awe" strains verb logic. The final paragraph is a visible scaffold artifact: "But wait, trim to fit—no, recount precisely...Wait, adjust—final adjustment ensures bounds. [Word count calibrated.]" This meta-commentary loop appears on the page and obscures the actual closure image, triggering the artifact penalty. Paraphrase loops are frequent: "converge/convergences aligned," "weather/weather-carriers," "nostalgic/nostalgia" cycle without adding pressure. Information density is low; many lines restate prior claims in synonym dress.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the story suffers from overwriting: "auroral sorrow" appears three times, "inescapable calling" twice, and phrases like "mnemonically gifted" and "rectifying the broken combination lock" feel label-heavy. The opening paragraphs layer metaphor densely ("spectral ribbons," "sorrowful northern lights," "bottled storm") without pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase loops occur ("charcoal-fingered hands" / "blackened fingers"). These artifacts dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; figurative language ("colossal crystal lung," "Braille confessions," "verity's veins") serves atmosphere without overwhelming. Some scaffold remains: "By piecing together the shredded treasure map, she would reread its secrets" repeats the map-reading beat unnecessarily; "reread the reassembled map thrice" loops the action. Template cadence in middle third ("She wilted there…But a small moment unfolded…Again she faltered") uses parallel structure without taught pattern payoff. Information density is high in vault beats, lower in bazaar transit. No critical opacity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "symphonies of truth that unveiled hidden beauties," "glistens cascaded across its facets," "kinetic arms spun furiously yet gracefully." Mixed metaphors appear ("throat closing like frostbitten petals," "quiet storm preserving wonder's hue"). Template cadence dominates: "She envisioned… she forged… she hollowed… she adjusted" across four paragraphs. Paraphrase loops recur ("wonder's spectrum," "color of wonder," "wonder's hue," "wonder's iridescent fight"). Figurative density in the climax ("visions of lost migrations, whispers of stellar nurseries") obscures rather than sharpens the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.4)
    Phrasing loops and template cadence pervade: "static roaring," "static clawed," "static recoiled" recur without added pressure; "wholeness fractured," "wholeness restored," "fragmented wholeness" cycle semantically. Sentence openings repeat ("Zeta glided," "Zeta's logic," "Zeta dragged," "Zeta tended") across the closure third. Mixed metaphors ("static clawed," "box yawned," "chaos blooming") and elevated diction ("eternal vigil," "throne") clash with the technical POV. The final paragraph stacks summary lines ("petals glowed," "farm endured," "harmony") that paraphrase rather than propel. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and −1.2 cumulative in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "Her work done" / "the mystery resolved" / "motivation manifest" / "Thus, the mystery resolved, motivation manifest" restate without adding pressure. Template stems dominate: "Elena [verb]… She [verb]…" in 8+ consecutive sentences from "She rose" onward. Stock metaphors appear without voice filter: "threads drawn to the locket's clasp," "dew dissolving like dew." Mixed vehicle: "sandstorm calm" (desert) applied to a courtyard "vibrant" with "dew-kissed jasmine" (lush). Figurative density in the final paragraph ("curator of more than objects," "stories' method triumphant," "quiet victory") reads elevated without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "calm defiance" appears five times, "mysterious familiarity" three times, "as a spider spins" recurs without payoff, and many paragraphs open with "Elara [verb]" or "The [noun]" stems. Stock metaphors ("spider's web," "silken thread") and therapy-speak labels ("encrypt vulnerability as strength") in peak beats reduce specificity. The final third is saturated with summary and thematic echo rather than scene pressure, triggering the artifact cap: disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8. Sentence-level propulsion is sluggish; many lines repeat content without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "mysterious anomalies that fluctuated mysteriously" is tautological, "gleaming silence" recurs four times as empty mood marker, and figurative density ("like a forgotten monument," "skeletal forms," "neural webs," "breathing voids") stacks without earned payoff. Paraphrase loops abound ("pockets of gravity" → "gravity pockets" → "gravity wells" across adjacent lines). Template cadence dominates the middle third: "He [verb]" structures repeat without variation. The closure beat—"ensuring the fluctuating pockets would nurture the memories back to life"—is summary-only abstraction, not concrete image. Artifacts touch closure; apply −1.7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "whispered secrets" appears three times, "tranquil blaze" five times, "smoothed hush" twice, "terrestrially cosmic" twice—all without reweighted meaning. Template cadence runs: "The brook responded…," "The prophecy's code stirred…," "The crane's origami wing trembled…" in succession. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "silver threads," "forgotten stars," "liquid starlight," "phosphorescent ripples" cluster in non-peak beats, diluting clarity. Apply −1.0 for loops and template stems, −0.4 for figurative muddle, totaling −1.4. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("luminous motes," "smoothed veil"), triggering the −1.7 cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "agreed upon lies" appears three times with similar phrasing, and "patiently nimble" recurs as a label without evolving. The rooftop interrogation suffers from summarized beats ("she interrogated further," "his facade wavered") that tell rather than show tactical moves. Figurative language is frequent ("streaks of fire," "cosmic glow") but not overwritten. The final image ("and it replied in kind") is abstract when a concrete sensory detail would sharpen closure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she suspected," "she'd recount") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("petals unfurled like shadowed cloaks," "storm trapped in glass," "prisms of grief"), creating density without proportionate propulsion. Template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "No longer haunted, her ghostly resolve…" / "No longer would the memory's ache bind her…"; "tragically radiant" recurs as label without evolving. The ritual beat relies on abstractions ("resonance structures," "primary resonance of longing, delocalized into secondary echoes") that obscure rather than clarify action. Paragraph-cut test fails multiple times: removing lines 32–34 or 36–37 does not change knowledge or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence carries figurative language ("invisible absolution," "stalactites dripped faster now, syncing with his heartbeat," "aurora swirling in approval or warning") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops recur: "calibrated treason" appears four times, "stalactites drip" anchors six beats with minimal variation, "wisely enduring" is repeated. Template cadence: "The treason had been… But wisdom had endured… Tonight, as stalactites dripped…" uses parallel "The X" / "But Y" / "Tonight, Z" stems. Mixed metaphor: "invisible chain" and "key of thorn" lack coherent vehicle logic. Density is low; many sentences restate prior content ("to forgive the unfinished meant embracing the half-life" after we've been told he seeks release). Register drifts into abstraction ("catharsis," "recalibrated into quiet legend") that clashes with the embodied ritual. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), triggering the −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "canyon echo singer" appears five times, "serpentine nexus" three times, "webs" six times, often restating the same thematic claim. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "The oracle gasped... The merchant shifted... The guardian sealed." Figurative language is dense but often mixed: "webs of intrigue spun by shadowed figures" under "starlight's indifferent gaze" blurs vehicle logic. Key closure beats—learning the answer, merchant's betrayal—are summarized rather than dramatized, flattening momentum. Stock metaphors ("lover's distant sigh," "spider silk") appear without fresh grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dense figurative language pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties ("breath fogging the air like borrowed starlight," "shattered vow," "twisted into windows of connection," "thread by thread," "veins of quartz"). Mixed metaphors appear: the globe's "sticky rim" and "viscous pool" clash with "windows of connection" and "veins of quartz." Register drifts into explanatory abstraction at peak beats ("truth coalesced, not as a shout but a careful weave"). Template cadence in the cameo sequence: "First came...," "Next...," "Deeper she delved...," "A child's spirit cameo..." Paraphrase loops: "expose" and "exposing" recur; "salvage" appears four times. Cumulative artifact penalty in Q7: −1.2; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.4)
    Density of figurative language is high across most paragraphs ("veil of glistening mist," "demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber," "gossamer webs," "moonpaths") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Template cadence appears in runs: "Kai [verb]" opens multiple sentences. Several paraphrase loops: "appreciate the hidden effort" recurs in three near-identical phrasings; "patterns" is repeated without added pressure. Register drifts into corporate/academic ("unyielding rhythm," "audacious in its claim," "reweights") outside the net-mender's plausible lexicon. Pronoun references and grammar are clean. Combined artifacts penalize −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "sharply observant eyes" → "His sharp eyes" → "observant mind"; "Elias scoffed inwardly" → "Elias knelt" → "Elias's pulse quickened" → "Elias leaned back" → "Elias hesitated" chains identical sentence stems across the middle third. Stock metaphors ("opium of the irradiated," "comfortable lies") and filter-verb stacks ("His keen gaze noting," "sharp eyes caught") dull immediacy in peak beats. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the walk away, losing propulsion. Apply −1.0 for patterned artifacts under the accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.3)
    Dense figurative language—"fractured jewels," "fireflies in a gale," "threads from a cosmic loom," "bruised horizon pregnant with change"—appears in nearly every paragraph without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, creating rhetorical weight that slows momentum (−0.6 for density without purpose). Paraphrase loops occur: "lonely visionary" / "alone for years" and "variant allegiance" / "allegiances variant" restate concepts across adjacent lines (−0.3). Repeated sentence stems ("Elias [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]") and the recycled modifiers "gritty," "whimsical," "lyrically prophetic," "variant" flatten rhythm (−0.5 for template cadence). Multiple metaphors clash or lack coherent vehicles: shadows both "cling like soot" and "seep as inky tendrils giggling," mixing registers without earned progression. Cumulative artifact debt prevents high-band eligibility and disallows 9+ globally per the filter-verb and template-cadence caps.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats: "rose-gold light pierced," "melody frail as spider silk," "vapors twist like auroras," "heart sweetened beyond measure." This density, while pattern-consistent, slows propulsion and obscures concrete action—mixing jar essences is told in metaphor rather than shown through tactile steps. Paraphrase loops appear: "lonesome splendor" recurs four times, "sweetened" six times, often restating mood without advancing pressure. Template cadence is present in several paragraph openings ("He wound," "He added," "Elias returned"). Sentence rhythm varies, but information density is low; many lines do decorative work rather than multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated diction ("floes groaned like awakening leviathans," "tendrils of fog coiling like lovers' limbs," "translucent flesh solidifying into peaceful mist"). Mixed metaphors abound—"fleshly glow that seeped into his skin," "sonic waves…fleshly vibrations…orgasmic clarity"—creating register drift and muddled vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 14–15 restate calibration and resonance in synonym cycles. Template cadence: repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across 8+ sentences. Filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("watched," "knew," "felt"). Stock phrases ("heart thundered," "tears carving hot paths") dull specificity. Artifacts touch the closure beat (paragraph 24), disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("moon paths," "restrained wildness," "basalt embrace," "storm restrained," "wheel turning," "magma under basalt," "blade of patience") without pattern-teaching or relief, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "wildness in her longed to charge" / "wild impulse leashed to precision" and "softly purposeful steps" / "hands, softly purposeful." Template stems recur: "The wildness in her longed… Yet Kai's words rooted… Now, in the sanctuary's core…" Stock metaphors (hearts as storms, patience as blades, roots delving) stack without fresh embodiment. These artifacts appear in peak beats (the climb, the severance) and touch the closure image, warranting the heavier penalty range and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully in the tunnel beats, and imagery is concrete (tarnished brass, candlelit cellar, whip cracking like thunder). Information density is high in the cataloging sequences. However, several artifact patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("entangled memories" appears three times across adjacent paragraphs; "watchfully calm" and "fortified vulnerability" recur as labels without fresh embodiment), template cadence in the memory-surge paragraphs ("Another reverberation shook... Elara steadied... memories surging"), and stock metaphor strings ("rivers," "veins," "roots," "chains"). The final paragraph stacks summary ("disentangled but etched forever," "unbreakable resolve") rather than landing on a charged image. Combined artifact load: −0.8 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack; the closure beat is touched by summary scaffolding, so the higher deduction applies.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm; figurative language (dust motes as fireflies, light as mercy) is vivid and mostly coherent. Information density is high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "aptly deliberate" (three times), "vibrant hush" (three times), and "calm before realization" (twice) without functional variation. The phrase "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" arrives mid-story as a tagged requirement, reading as scaffolded insertion. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("Stepping out...he vowed...realization bloomed") stacks declarative summary beats. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template cadence (−0.4), and phrase-insertion artifact (−0.3) totals roughly −0.9 in Q7, holding the score in the low-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "steadily curious" appears five times, "irreverent awe" six times, and "yearning algorithm" is restated in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate—"She chuckled... She sketched... She pondered... She whispered"—across the second half. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: gears "gossip," the sea "belches," and the workshop "creaks sympathetically" within two paragraphs, violating physical logic. Figurative density at peak beats (climax ascent) obscures causal sequence, and the final third contains scaffold phrasing ("Through evolution's full arc") that abstracts rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "Did they dissolve into nothingness, or haunt the archive's underlayers" closely mirrors "where deleted files truly went, beyond the official purge." Template cadence ("Yet here… Yet the numbers…") and synonym churn ("recurring," "recurred," "persisted") cluster in the middle third. The self-aware scaffold ("word count exceeded; trim back mentally, but proceed as is? No, must fit") is a generation artifact that breaks immersion. The final third includes "sensed absence" three times without fresh pressure, and "2519 pulsed once more, a final song unsung" stacks metaphors that blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "shadow-laced peacekeeper" appears four times, "courageous anomaly" three times, "calmly intuitive" twice, and "map empathy onto action" twice, often in nearly identical clauses. Stock metaphor strings ("eyes flicking," "shadows coiling," "leaf-veined," "bark-skinned") appear in most high-pressure beats without fresh embodiment. Register drifts into abstract exposition mid-scene: "Not illusions, but empathic truths, refracted through the mirrors' antique patina" and "With a breath syncing to the lighthouse pulse above, she channeled the mappings" are tonally disconnected from the immediate threat of war. Simultaneity errors: "Gasps rippled; minions stilled, dryad's leaves unfurled slightly" implies overlapping reactions in a single instant, and the final two paragraphs loop the same closure sentiment across adjacent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("clinked like fragile chimes," "silk tearing slowly") is vivid when deployed. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She gripped reality loosely now" in paragraph 3 and "her loose grip on reality" in paragraph 13; "windborne solace" recurs five times without evolving pressure; "the sound of approaching endings" is repeated across multiple paragraphs in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence is present in adjacent beats: "She fingered…She gripped…She slipped…She smiled." The final paragraph stacks summary declarations ("No more trawling needed; the endings sang clear now. In that hush, she found home") that dull the closure image's immediacy. These artifacts accumulate but do not obscure causality; routing penalty here per guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is adequate; no causality breaks or spatial confusion. Rhythm varies across paragraphs, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. However, paraphrase loops appear: "destined to diverge like vines twisting apart" / "destined mismatches"; "amber glow" recurs four times without fresh detail; "gently persuasive" is labeled twice. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats: "overripe fruit," "steady flame," "tapestry of passionate subtlety," "eternal clashes that birth beauty." Register drift into abstraction ("intersubjective understanding," "alchemy where one heart echoes another's hidden rhythms") appears in the closure zone, dulling immediacy. Template cadence in Theo's backstory: "In my youth…I met Clara" / "Just as your architect…Clara and I" / "See here…she wrote." Combined artifacts in the final third trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack baseline (−0.6 to −1.0 in Q7) and disallow 9+ globally per the cap rule.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "echoes of wisdom" appears six times with near-synonyms ("echo of wisdom," "wisdom's echo," "echoes preserved"); "murmuring" and "whisper" recur decoratively across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "He [verb], [noun] [verb]" structures dominate mid-passage ("He chanted low, words…"; "He turned, conjured clearings…"). Stock metaphors ("threads of ancient truths," "fragile lines tighter") and filter-verb stacks ("he sensed," "he saw," "he knew") dull immediacy in the consecration beat. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("wisdom endured," "echoes preserved"), triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally. Spatial choreography remains vague (distance from pavilion to parapet, position of seekers).

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive template cadence: "Elara [verb], her [noun] [verb]-ing" recurs across a dozen beats. Paraphrase loops abound: "linger," "vines climbing," and "arcs" are recycled without added pressure. The phrase "earnest whimsy" appears four times; "perceptively calm" three times. Mixed metaphors cluster in the opening: vines as "patient fingers" immediately followed by blooms in "gentle conspiracy." Filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she unclasped," "she arranged") dull immediacy in high-density beats. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("her calm purpose ignited anew"), disallowing 9+ and capping high-band eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "suspended hush" appears five times with minimal variation; "fractured sequences" recurs as a template stem across multiple beats. The middle third cycles through voice-fragment examples (1892 child, 1947 debate, 1623 Latin, 1999 slang) in list fashion without sentence variety or propulsion. Figurative language is dense but often mixed: "words had ossified… their growth halted forever" immediately followed by "no lexicon would swell again" restates the same idea. The final staccato paragraphs ("Weathered innocence, unbroken. / The end of words was but a pause.") attempt rhythmic closure but read as stacked fragments rather than purposeful compression. Line-level clarity is adequate; no causality breaks, but momentum drags in the catalog beats.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("fog-wreathed totems," "prophecy-forged fingers," "chalk dust powdering his fingertips like aged marrow"), creating a dense, ornamented texture that occasionally obscures propulsion. Paraphrase loops are present: "clinging to echoes" and "tidal longing" recur as labels without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the closing paragraph ("He smiled…ready to locate"; "The fog…sighed…dreaming"; "Elias rose…walked on"). No grammar errors, but the high metaphor density and synonym churn (tide/ebb/flow/surge) dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering cumulative artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is grammatically clean and sensory details are concrete (micrometeorites, calipers, micro-notches), but pervasive overwriting and loops drain momentum. "Luminous ache" recurs five times without variation; "changelessly constant" appears twice in identical phrasing; "ephemeral" nine times as a repeated modifier rather than evolving image. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "luminous pearl in the void," "cosmic whispers," "pixels of fire," "veins a map of lost worlds," "breathing with fragile rhythm" cluster without adding causal pressure. The final third stacks summary sentences in uniform cadence ("The pulsar image beamed to Terra... Escape velocity achieved... Foundations may shake again... Elias polished on...") that read as epilogue checklist rather than propulsive closure. Template stems ("Elias [verb]" opening multiple sequential sentences) and synonym churn ("ephemeral," "transient," "fleeting," "impermanent") indicate scaffold artifacts that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with vivid images ("golden threads," "rainbows danced on its edges"). However, pervasive overwriting and template cadence flatten momentum. Repeated phrasal stems ("pulsing stillness" appears three times; "decisively kind" twice; "hymning the mundane" becomes a refrain without variation) create a drumbeat rhythm rather than propulsion. Figurative density is high without escalation: nearly every paragraph carries a metaphor or motif tag ("sanctuary of glass," "fault lines of a shattered life," "key to whatever melody awaited"), and the vehicles sometimes contradict (fault lines don't crack like vinyl grooves; vinyl isn't a literal key). Paraphrase loops appear: "The scent permeated the chamber, a core concept made tangible" restates the prior sentence's effect. Scaffold phrases ("Now, in this pulsing stillness," "Then, a soft chime," "In that moment") punctuate transitions mechanically. The final third sustains this density without a clarity break, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence is pervasive: "quietly deliberate" appears three times identically, and many sentences open with "Elara [verb]" or "[Her X], [verb]" creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops occur (paragraph 3 restates the Bending twice; "seal/sealed/sealing/awakenings" cluster without advancing meaning). Stock metaphors ("breath caught," "smile faintly") and filter-verb stacks ("She understood instantly," "Elara smiled faintly") dull immediacy. Information density is low; many lines restate world rules rather than advancing pressure. Apply −1.2 cumulative for template cadence, loops, and stock phrasing touching multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe text-artifact debt across the piece. Template cadence: "She'd tell... She'd demonstrate" and synonym loops ("yearn/yearning" eight times, "shrewd/shrewdly innocent" five times, "cleft" six times as motif and noun). Paraphrase loops: "Her skepticism a cleft widening" / "The cleft in the tooth" / "her certainty cleft mended." Filter-verb stack in middle third ("seemed to bow," "sworn changelings," "dismissed Grandma's claim"). Mixed metaphor: "mistakes as errant stars" then "set it into a hollow" conflates celestial and surgical imagery. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch closure beat (final third), disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting throughout: "reflectively vibrant," "zephyr bloom," "pearl of stillness," "serpentine," "blooming," and "resurfaced/resurfacing" appear in nearly every paragraph, creating decorative density that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops are frequent: "resurfaced unbidden" / "memories resurfaced in waves" / "as memories resurfaced" / "memories fully resurfaced"; "bloomed softly" / "bloom of possibility" / "blooming into purpose" / "bloomed like a zephyr-kissed flower." Template cadence: multiple sentences open with participial phrases or "As [noun]" constructions. Mixed metaphors: "mist swirling like a blooming zephyr" (zephyr is a breeze, not a visual bloom). These artifacts pervade the closure paragraph ("blooming into purpose," "reflectively vibrant harmony"), applying the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally. Filter-verb stacks ("felt lighter," "felt unburdened") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("moss spores danced faintly in the light," "icicles dripping final notes to their silent pact," "honeyed hush amplifying her voice like a secret shared in honey"), obscuring momentum and creating a lyric gloss that stalls action. Paraphrase loops appear ("protected vulnerability," "vulnerability armored in the garden's embrace, where vulnerability could breathe"). Template stems recur ("Elara's watchful…," "quietly proactive," "honeyed hush"). The final third ("viral storm outside faded," "no more old wounds untreated; new meanings grafted") stacks summary and theme statements instead of propelling the ending through image and action. Stock metaphors ("moss claiming silicon bones," "bridges built from shared fractures") accumulate without fresh precision. Register drift into abstraction ("to graft new meaning onto them") clashes with embodied urgency. Combined artifacts trigger −1.4 within Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact-penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive overwriting harms momentum: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("dying heart," "feral nexus," "splintered ambitions," "avian hope imprinting on his mind's canvas") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without clarity. Template cadence runs plague the piece: "With solemn gravity, he lifted… murmuring vows… The ritual bound her… the first shape gathered. Against the current… he pressed on… Another cameo materialized… Elias solemnized him swiftly… Two shapes now collected." Paraphrase loops appear: "swirling hush" (opening and closing), "against the current" (repeated across four beats), "ephemeral cameo" (three times). The closure beat is obscured by abstraction ("manuscript alive in his hands, the shapes of hopes now his novel's beating core") rather than concrete image. Register drift into stock poetic diction ("wings beating against invisible winds," "avian hope") clashes with the attempt at immediacy. Applying artifact penalties: density overwriting −0.7, template cadence −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, closure obscured by abstraction adds escalation to −1.7 total, plus the final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled, though dense in early paragraphs ("silken veil," "acorn shells and beetle wings," "thistledown"). Clarity holds; no loops or contradictions. However, minor scaffold appears: "the attribute of her loom spun golden stories" is expository mid-action, and several sentences open with formulaic constructions ("Those forgotten songs," "Below, in the village," "The arbor folk"). The phrase "a glowing tapestry" and "roots below pulsed with renewed vigor, blight retreating like shadows at noon" edge toward stock metaphor. Information density is high but momentum flags in the long middle paragraph cataloging story threads.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors and elevated diction in nearly every sentence ("skeletal apple trees clawed at perpetual twilight," "veins bulging like roots seeking water," "a Morse of longing and loss"). This creates atmospheric richness but also overwriting that slows momentum during the ritual's key beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "patience was his deepest alchemy" → "he demonstrated it physically now" restates rather than advances. Template cadence in the pattern-assembly sequence (e.g., "A loop of rusted wire became... Shriveled apple cores formed... Tin fragments outlined... Branch twists sketched...") and filter-verb stacks ("watching it seep," "seeing Eira's path") dull immediacy. Some clarity issues: "the moving stillness" recurs as a thematic phrase but its literal referent (what is moving? what is still?) remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose demonstrates high information density and varied syntax, weaving sensory detail through action. However, the piece suffers from pervasive figurative density in nearly every sentence ("frost etched fragile veins," "silence hung like a shroud," "echoes bending like harvest sheaves"), which blurs propulsion in high-pressure beats and risks overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff. Several lines loop conceptually: "harvest of echoes" / "echoes harvested" / "echoes of self harvested" restates the core image without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the time-marker transitions ("Dawn's first pallor," "By midday," "Across the afternoon lull," "Dusk bled"), which creates predictable rhythm rather than escalating urgency. Cumulative artifacts lower momentum without touching causality directly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density pervades without pattern-teaching or payoff: "shingled hush" appears four times, "boundary-lessly" twice, "whalebone reverie" three times, creating paraphrase loops rather than escalation. Mixed metaphors—"bronze-veined stone" after "whalebone reverie," "captive star" alongside "needles"—muddle sense. Template cadence: "One fractal bloomed… another for… came last" in mid-scene. Artifact penalty −0.8 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"rust-hued peace," "grief's forge," "steam threading upward like a genie's promise," "wood dust sifted like fine sand"—without relief or contrast, creating a lyric saturation that flattens urgency in the carving beats. Template cadence appears in mid-section: "She selected… She lifted… She polished… She engraved…" (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "here and gone" recurs five times without evolving meaning (−0.3). Some phrases border on stock ("bottling the roar of life against silence"). Information density is solid; no major clarity breaks. The combined artifacts and overwriting pull this below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("kinetic lagoon," "vapor reefs," "carousel dust glittering on spectral shoulders") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering overwriting deductions. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "ambitions—once sharp as scavenger blades—lay worn to nubs" restates "ambitions he'd chased" within two lines; "carousel ceased its hypnotic whirl" echoes "carousel halted." Sentence stems repeat ("Elias X," "The Y," "From the Z") across beats without variation. Register drifts into abstract diction ("chronologically misplaced," "fractured polyphony") that clashes with scavenger-POV lexicon. Accumulative artifacts (density without clarity, loops, template cadence) justify −0.6 to −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear, with purposeful technical detail and clean grammar. However, template-cadence runs appear: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" structures ("She knelt," "She traced," "She walked"), and synonym loops recur around "stoic" and "intentions." The phrase "equations for hope" is repeated without reweighting. Figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff: "a maze of intentions," "veins to a heart," "lattice of possibility" within a few beats. Information density is moderate; some scaffolding ("her functionally creative mind igniting") could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.9)
    Density is high, but overwriting pervades: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without respite ("glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia," "elongated shadows…lean in expectancy"), and stock metaphor strings ("frozen cathedrals," "living oracle") muddle clarity in peak beats. Paraphrase loops recur: "excruciatingly gentle" appears three times in identical syntactic slots, and "petrichor nostalgia" cycles through five sentences with diminishing return. Template cadence runs (e.g., "He bore…to his chest," "He rose…placing the music box," "Elias bore the onslaught") flatten propulsion. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.6 baseline for loops + register drift, escalated to −0.9 for closure-beat presence of "petrichor nostalgia wove into his every breath forevermore"), and the pervasive figurative saturation (−0.5), yields cumulative −1.4 in Q7, and artifacts in the final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "thoughtfully clear" / "hindsight clarity" / "serene upheaval" recur across beats without added pressure; "by training instincts" appears three times as a template opener. Stock metaphors ("mist clung to the water like unspoken regrets," "shadows into velvet indigo") stack without specificity. Synonym churn around "architecture of lies" / "intricate scaffolds" / "submerged scaffolds" restates the concept without advancing it. The closure paragraph loops: "serene upheaval lingered" after already declaring "his understanding complete" and "motive fulfilled." Filter-verb stacks ("remained thoughtfully clear," "sensing the pull," "caught the dying light") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Information density is low—most sentences restate mood or theme rather than advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every paragraph ("snowflakes whispered," "fog rolled...like a living breath," "philosophy unfurling like kelp"), creating density without always advancing pressure. Several lines paraphrase the same content: "coax it forth, drawing hidden truths" and "coaxed the next" repeat the core action without added cost. Template cadence appears in the decoding sequence: "One twist unraveled...Kael's eyes widened as Elias coaxed the next...Elias persisted...Layer by layer, knots yielded." The phrase "infinitely patient" is repeated identically across four beats, constituting a stock label rather than rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.3)
    Density of figurative language in most sentences creates overwriting: "jagged horizon," "filigreed patterns," "bruised purple," "vein of molten amber," "arterial blood yet soft as a lover's sigh" cluster without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in the obituary beats: "For Captain Lira Voss… For Mira… For Thorne… For Elowen" with parallel syntax across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops recur: "projecting presence" is restated across lines without added pressure. Applying −0.9 for density and template runs, plus −0.3 for loops, totaling approximately −1.2 in Q7, and the artifacts touch multiple beats including near-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "What if birds were the flawed genesis" / "such origins explained the world's mechanical pall" / "the flawed genesis made flesh" restate the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("He hypothesized… He whispered… He nestled… He activated…"), and the word "quaking" appears in fourteen lines, often as synonym churn for "trembling" or "shuddering." Stock metaphors ("beauty's return," "genesis forever flawed") and the repeated stem "What if…?" flatten propulsion. If closure-beat artifacts were present, the penalty would escalate; here they pervade supporting beats, triggering −1.4 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose carries vivid imagery ("obsidian shards gleamed like forgotten blades," "grains like pulverized midnight"), but several issues accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "scars can sing" is stated three times across the piece without variation; "kelp-drift peace" recurs as a label rather than evolving. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with participial phrases ("Kneeling by," "Threading a length," "Looping the red-threaded coin," "Rising, Lira felt"). The self-interruptions ("Wait, over—trim"; "Actually, precise count needed") are scaffold artifacts that should have been removed. Stock metaphors ("soft as compassion," "red as fresh lava yet soft as compassion") mix vehicle and tenor clumsily. The final third contains the highest density of these loops and scaffolds, touching the closure beat and preventing entry to the 9-band globally.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is grammatically clean with vivid imagery, but figurative density is high across most beats without escalation: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("temporal adhesive," "thrumming memories," "sidereal pinpoint," "star-dew"). Template cadence appears in repeated "breadcrumb" structures and parallel constructions. Several paraphrase loops: "skepticism flared" / "skepticism tempered," "realistically imaginative" repeated across multiple paragraphs, "defiant hush" recurs without functional shift. Information density is moderate; many lines describe atmosphere rather than advancing causality. The closure beat is clear but not propulsive, and the figurative load throughout dampens momentum rather than charging key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with short declaratives ("Petals sighed onward") balancing longer cumulative sentences. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "troubling serenity" recurs three times without added pressure; "approximates infinity" and "infinite loops" churn synonymously. Template cadence runs in the final third ("Petals fell, sighing secrets to the stars. / Transit complete, light shared, patterns pondered."). Figurative language is dense but controlled, with "petal-sigh detritus" and "gear-veined surface" offering concrete images. Information density is high, though some scaffold lines ("Generations stirred, forever altered") summarize rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains vivid sensory detail and a consistent lyric register, but suffers from pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in the opening stacks figurative language ("fractured glass panes caught the fading sun like shattered memories," "iridescent river," "thundering calm," "living cathedral"), creating density without proportional information gain. Synonym churn appears in repeated descriptor patterns—"fiercely meditative" recurs as both label and structural marker, and scaffold phrasing like "he retraced" and "the ribbon unfurled" loop across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the middle section: "He followed... from the central fountain... to the shadowed alcove," and several beats begin with "Elias [verb]" or "The [noun]" stems. The closure beat remains legible despite the texture, preventing deeper penalty, but the artifact spread across high-pressure moments (the realization paragraph, the final departure) keeps the score in the mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose opens with strong imagery—"waves hurled themselves," "obsidian ridge," "pendulum bob swaying hypnotically"—but quickly accumulates template cadence and paraphrase loops. Runs of "Elias [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" across consecutive sentences create rhythmic monotony. Key phrases recur without variation: "searing reverie" appears four times, "incremental absolution" three, "shared balance" twice, and "ethically diligent" twice, functioning as scaffolding rather than purposeful motif. The climactic vision sequence stacks synonym clusters ("Memories flooded," "visions emerged," "Inscriptions cascaded") and filter-verb constructions ("He saw," "appeared," "emerged") that dull immediacy. The final paragraph tells the closure ("absolution complete," "emerged—whole") rather than showing cost through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades: figurative language ("velveteen gloom," "minutes bled," "pulsing with latent stories") appears in nearly every sentence without escalation or pattern-teaching, triggering density penalties. Template cadence runs plague high-pressure beats: "He moved… knight leaping, pawn advancing" / "His fingers… traced… deciphered… untangled" / "Elias… set… unrolled… teased." Paraphrase loops recur: the "velveteen gloom" appears five times with minor synonym variation ("gathering dark," "deeper… gloom," "thickened"). Register drift into abstract academic diction ("orchestrated cries," "conceptual repricing") clashes with the gardener POV. The climax (decoding the border) is summarized rather than dramatized with concrete action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.9)
    Clarity is generally strong, but the prose suffers from pervasive scaffold and template cadence. Paraphrase loops are frequent: "the kingdom's fate poised on this precipice, innovation stirring beneath ice" restates prior material without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("doubt clawed," "future written in the unwritten") and elevated diction ("prevail," "cartography of ignorance") create register drift. Runs of identical sentence structures ("He ignited," "He reviewed," "He positioned," "He angled," "He smiled") across the climax trigger template-cadence penalties. Information density is moderate, but figurative language in nearly every sentence of the final third dilutes rather than sharpens the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dense figurative language ("tendrils of fog curled like forgotten melodies," "thistled calm," "secretly luminous") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty (−0.5 baseline). Paraphrase loops abound: "copyist preserved symphonies" restated as "her diligent work"; "dust swirling" then "motes rose…swirling." Template cadence runs in paragraph structure ("She [verb]…Her [noun]…") flatten propulsion. Mixed metaphor: "thistled calm" pairs prickly threat with serenity without reconciling the contradiction, reducing clarity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    句rhythm varies and figurative language is generally purposeful. However, "weaves truth carefully" and "incomplete information" are repeated verbatim across distant beats without evolution, creating conceptual loops. The phrase "somber marvel" recurs five times, dulling its impact. The meta-commentary at the end ("Wait, adjust: exhaled, perpetuating the weave. [792—final tally...]") is visible scaffolding that breaks immersion and confirms generation artifact. Deduct −0.8 for loops and scaffold touching the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "competing narratives" appears five times with minor variation; "agonize/agonizing/agonized" recurs four times across adjacent paragraphs restating the same internal conflict; "rationally rebellious" and "abrasive calm" are repeated as labels without fresh context. Template cadence dominates the excavation sequence ("First stratum... Second layer... Third layer, deepest") and several beats open with identical structures ("Elias, a wannabe philosopher"; "Elias countered rationally"; "Elias agonized"). Stock metaphors ("drowned fire," "false heartbeats," "forgotten grudges") appear in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching. The −1.4 artifact penalty applies for spread and presence in the closure paragraph ("Preservation begun; narratives competed").

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence reduce momentum: "denoted the vanishing world's last map," "denoted the breach," "denoted progress," "denoted completion" recur without added pressure. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "subtracting noise" is restated five times across the piece without functional variation. Stock metaphors cluster in high-pressure beats: "threads from fractured souls," "braid diverse voices," "discord that devours," "leaves pressed like amber sigils." The final third contains scaffold sentences that restate prior material ("Across unlearning hatred, she'd denoted the path; by subtracting noise, harmony prevailed"). Filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "she mused") and passive constructions ("was expectantly resigned," "might fade") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 baseline and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates (shorter beats during the planting, longer during reflection). Information density is moderate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "gentle rebellion" is restated three times across the story without added nuance; "synaptic plasticity" recurs as exposition rather than dramatized effect. Template cadence in the memory-tasting beats ("One vine held... another..."). Stock metaphors: "neural spark," "tender shoots," "sprouting thoughts." The final paragraph's list ("memory-pruned salad with knowledge fruit dressing, to awaken the first converts") reads more expository than propulsive. Clarity is maintained, but scaffold and thematic echo reduce line-level tightness. Deductions: paraphrase-loop −0.4, template cadence −0.4, thematic label repetition −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    Figurative language is dense and sometimes overwritten: "nectar dusk settled...like spilled honey," "lightning's nectar feed," "dancing on lightning's nectar feed," "electric honey"—nectar/honey recurs in nearly every paragraph without evolving meaning. The riddle's archaic register ("waxen halls where tempests breed") clashes with the bio-engineered drone conceit. Rhythm varies and sentences advance plot, but synonym churn appears ("nectar dusk deepened to velvet" after "nectar dusk deepened"). Paraphrase loop: "Drones failing like forgotten bees in dusk" restates the riddle's content. No severe artifacts touch closure, capping penalty per the non-closure accumulation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy overwriting and density issues pervade high-pressure beats: "profound stillness that tugged at his core," "pauses pregnant with possibility," and stacked metaphors ("yearning for reclamation," "thread weaving silence into form") in adjacent lines without payoff. Template cadence runs appear ("Placing... he drew... He whispered... As the essence mingled..."), and paraphrase loops recur ("alive homes," "houses live," "houses felt alive"). Figurative language clusters without clear pattern-teaching, and elevated diction ("sanctify," "hushed intensity") drifts from the POV's established lexicon. Applying cumulative artifact penalties (density, template stems, loops) totals approximately −1.4 in Q7, with an additional penalty for touching the closure beat, yielding a base near 4.9.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "bioluminescent anemones pulsing like forgotten heartbeats," "stone fountains wept slow veils of bubbles," "pearl eyes igniting with ethereal light." Mixed metaphors appear ("drown in black and white, swimmer"; "certainty a anchor dragging her down"). Template cadence emerges in the revelation sequence: "Thalor projected / continued / explained" cycle. Paraphrase loops: "the secret" recurs across adjacent lines without added pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but figurative stacking slows momentum. Applying −0.8 for density + coherence issues touching multiple beats; −0.3 for template cadence in the revelation cascade; total baseline −1.1 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully across beats, and information density is generally high. However, multiple lines exhibit paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "perpetual motion" and "endless" recur heavily without added pressure, and adjacent sentences restate concepts ("proofs etched into steps behind him, a trail of grim hope, perpetual in their futility"). Template cadence appears in the equation-building passage ("Line by line, he built the model: ... His pen raced, proving ..."). The final paragraph stacks summary-like constructions ("texture lingered, motivation sated yet insatiable, driving ...") that dull momentum. Stock metaphor ("heart pounding in timeless rhythm") and filter-verb stacks reduce immediacy. Apply −0.8 for pattern artifacts and loop issues within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often successful ("fogged by distant factory haze," "curling like tentative leaves," "saffron diffusing in broth"). Clear loops and template artifacts appear: "methodically hopeful" repeated verbatim, "moon-tipped brush" x3, and parallel "Stroke by deliberate stroke, methodically hopeful" construction. The vision cascade uses similar stems ("First came," "Generations later," "Daydreams cascaded"). Filter-verb stack ("came," "seemed," "felt," "watched") in the climax reduces immediacy. Line-level clarity is generally strong, but density and repetition drag momentum in the final third. −0.6 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for filter-verb cluster.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"rosewater dread," "emerald hues," "doughy initials rising like defiant sigils"—and while individually vivid, the accumulation in peak beats (ice shattering, fleeing) slows propulsion without adding causal detail. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Elara shaped… Elara seized… Elara distributed" across consecutive short paragraphs. Paraphrase loops surface in adjacent lines: "thaw begins" / "thaw accelerating" and "displaced persons gathered" / "displaced would be dragged back." These artifacts dull momentum and trigger baseline deductions (−0.6 for template stems, −0.2 for paraphrase loop, totaling roughly −0.8), though clarity at closure remains intact, preventing heavier penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "latent radiance waiting to ignite," "freedom demanded everything," "bleak exhilaration eternal" stack figurative language without coherent vehicle. Paraphrase loops appear ("counter-clockwise precision" / "counter-clockwise spirals" / "counter-clockwise warning"). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun] [verb]" or "Elias [verb]." The phrase "neatly inventive" recurs five times without variation, flattening momentum. Mixed metaphor: the stone "hungered" yet also "exhaled," and radiance both "seeps like bile" and "explodes outward."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive overwriting: figurative density in nearly every sentence ("bioluminescent slime trailing from a deep-sea abomination," "lovers in agony," "mercury tears") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops abound: "repulsive allure" recurs five times; "luminance/glow" chains across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "She [verb], the [noun]…" runs through multiple beats. Stock metaphors (maw/vortex of teeth, weeping mirrors) and therapy-speak ("unbosom," "shame photographically cursed") in the climax trigger cumulative penalties. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final "luminance pulsed once more"), disallowing 9+ and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("sea's vast mirror fractured into sapphire shards," "clouds churned like ink," "thunderous applause gone wrong") without pattern-teaching or cumulative payoff, violating the overwriting density check. Adjacent lines loop: "Restlessness gnawed… Restless euphony swelled… Yet restlessness persisted… Restless euphony reigned" recycles the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He rose… He lashed… He struck… He leaped" runs across multiple beats. Mixed metaphor: "symphony of unease where harmony clashed against chaos" contradicts itself—symphony implies order, yet the vehicle is disorder. Applying density (−0.5), loop (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), and metaphor muddle (−0.4) totals ~−1.8 in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat ("restless euphony reigned"), triggering the disallow-9+ global cap and high-band 8.8 ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.7)
    Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but the piece carries pervasive figurative density without pattern-teaching: "molten gold," "silent storm," "dread pooling like sweat," "ripples and faded signals on the waves," "accusing fingers," "notes curling like smoke." In the climactic beats, metaphor stacks ("sunwashed dread crested," "visions flooded," "dooming...to drift faster") obscure immediate causality and flatten propulsion (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear: "quietly driven" recurs four times across the text, and "sunwashed dread" is invoked thrice without reweighting (−0.4). Template stems ("Elara [verb]" opening multiple paragraphs) and filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "she ignored," "she perched," "she blew") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.5). Combined artifact spread touching closure disallows 9+ globally and applies cap at 8.7 per high-band entry gate.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is generally high, but significant paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs restate the noble-lies concept and parallel-drawing method with synonym churn ("noble deceptions," "pit of lies," "noble lie," "lies' noble shroud"). Template cadence runs across multiple beats ("Elias [verbed]...He [verbed]..."). The phrase "drawing parallels" recurs mechanically in four separate paragraphs without added nuance. These artifacts accumulate beyond the −0.8 non-closure cap, totaling roughly −1.2, and touch the penultimate paragraphs near closure, triggering the 9+ disqualification and high-band cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries figurative language ("quiet fury of waves," "hushed blaze," "restrained embers," "jealous ghosts," "vise," "quiet pyre"), creating density that obscures rather than sharpens. Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear ("interlaced absence" recurs as label across multiple paragraphs; "hushed blaze" is restated as "hushed inferno," "subdued fire," "quiet pyre"). Template cadence runs through the wrestling sequences ("He wrestled... he endured... he wrestled"). The final third summary ("Elias smiled," "The pavilion endured," "Waves hushed their rage") stacks abstractions and filter verbs, dulling the closure image. Figurative muddle: "blaze veiled in whispers" mixes thermal and auditory vehicles incoherently. Combined artifacts trigger the lower-band penalty and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "tranquilly perceptive" appears four times, "dappled resolve" five times, "reclaimed stillness" three times, "honest origins" four times—synonym churn without added pressure. Adjacent lines restate: "This quiet…now enveloped her like a balm" followed by "She considered her method: abandon strict logic…" is a pivot, but "Elara's logical mind raced, indexing implications" then "Yet in reclaiming this stillness, truth settled" loops the concept. Mixed metaphor: "shadows clung…like forgotten regrets" then "water's distant murmur was the only pulse" switches vehicles. Closure beat ("light was reborn—not of lanterns, but insight") abstracts rather than images. Artifacts touch the ending; accumulation exceeds −1.4 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.4)
    Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty (e.g., "porcelain cups amid bonsai camellias" anchors setting and mood). However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn cluster throughout: "luminous torment" / "radiant agony" / "lacerating" / "luminous yet lacerating" recur across five beats without functional variation. Template cadence appears in parallel structures: "Elar's crafty mind," "Elar's crafty precision," "crafty lantern maker" (three mentions). The final third repeats "luminous" and "torment" in tight proximity without pattern-teaching or payoff beyond first use. Mixed metaphor: "shadow peel away like smoke" (solid→gas) followed by "detachment" (solid anchor) creates slight vehicle wobble. Filter-verb stack: "watched," "began," "approached," "entered," "ignited" in close sequence dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops, −0.4 for template stems, −0.3 for filter density: total ~−1.5 in Q7. Figurative language in most sentences of the transformation beat (ether, gossamer, veined, unfurling) without clear pattern justification adds −0.3 for density. No clarity break at closure, so artifact penalties stay within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (wedding backstory, crystal properties, perturbation method delivered efficiently). However, template cadence appears in the closure sequence: "She'd return, again and again, hunting more. The geode pulsed, her heart's echo. Unfiltered, unbreakable." applies repetitive short-stem structure without taught pattern payoff, triggering −0.4. Mixed metaphor: "mist made stone" and "quantum specter" sit uneasily with "solid to the eye yet phasing through barriers." Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Paraphrase loop: "unused potential pooling" recurs without added pressure in final paragraph, applying −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    "Brilliant dimness" appears six times; "perpetually surprised" recurs four times without variation—classic paraphrase loops. Sentence stems repeat: "Elara [verb]" opens five consecutive paragraphs mid-story. The drone-launch sequence ("two dozen pinprick lights bursting") and lever-pull ("she pulled the lever sharply") deliver clarity, but figurative density ("constellations birthing letters") in the climax risks metaphor muddle. Information density is moderate; many lines advance action, yet scaffold phrases ("he whispered," "she murmured") pad beats.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and vivid in places ("watch hand, bent and tarnished, frozen at half-past three"). However, it suffers from pervasive template cadence, paraphrase loops, and motif overuse. "Tempered," "quell," "sieved hush," "unspoken words," and "weight" recur across most paragraphs without evolving function. Adjacent sentences restate content: "Guilt clung to him" / "regret tempered his resolve"; "he'd quelled her doubts" / "they gnawed at him"; "false memories he'd manufactured flickered" / "Mira's imagined grandfather." Sentence stems repeat ("He'd…," "The…," "Elias…") across runs of three or more lines. Filter-verb stacks ("he'd obliged," "he'd quelled," "he'd learned," "he'd withheld") dull immediacy. These artifacts spread across the final third, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty and global 9+ disqualification. Deduction: −1.2 in Q7 for template cadence, paraphrase loops, and motif churn touching closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive overwriting: figurative density saturates peak beats without pattern-teaching or payoff ("Mist clung...like a shroud," "wind howled impartial judgments," "cycles synchronized to heal"). Paraphrase loops are frequent: "apology embodied" / "false key that birthed our feud" restate across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "Elara's fingers traced...," "Elara approached...," "Elara extended..." within tight span. Stock metaphors ("chains of grudge," "shadows into light") and therapy-inflected abstractions ("fragile timeframe," "uncommonly thoughtful") cluster in the closure paragraph. Artifacts touch the ending, triggering elevated penalty and 9+ disqualification globally per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.7)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades: "merrily melancholic" appears five times, "flickering faith" four times, "gravitate/gravitated" four times, "backlash of regrets" three times, creating template cadence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops cluster in the regret passages: "slithering up like tide pools," "heavy as anchors," "orbiting tighter"—all conveying the same content. Filter-verb stacks appear in reflective beats ("began their backlash, slithering"). Stock metaphors abound: "heart's compass," "redemption's distant lighthouse," "candle in gale." The prose is rhythmically competent in places ("stroke left, eye the first pole's lean"), but scaffold phrasing ("he muttered," "he whispered") and synonym churn ("expectations collapsed," "faith flickered," "regrets receded") dull momentum. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat ("true north emerged," "faith steady at last"), triggering elevated deductions and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overwriting pervades: "delicately robust" appears three times, "jaded wonder" four times, creating a loop that dulls momentum (apply −0.8 for density and repetition in peak beats). Mixed metaphors: "cracked like ancient parchment yet unyielding under pressure" contradicts itself; "calcified heart" and "hollow shell" are stacked clichés. Template cadence: "He unfolded... began reading... Patterns emerged... Chronos had marked... Jax's motivation crystallized" runs identical stems without variation. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("delicately robust" in the lake description, "jaded wonder" in the final line), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Scaffold phrases ("amid crumpled newspapers," "fueled by jaded wonder") add no information.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Paradoxically steady amid her grief's tempests" / "paradoxically steady like the moon's orbit" / "paradoxically steady, her spirit anchored" / "paradoxically steady amid metamorphosis's flux." Synonym churn for "bond": transcended, forged, severance, reforge, embers fanned. Figurative density in nearly every line without pattern-teaching: "pyre of forgotten stars," "shadow-wolves," "phoenix embers," "nebulae," "antlers of starlight." Register drift into cosmic abstraction clashes with the concrete task of gathering spices. Multiple beats summarized rather than dramatized: the gathering, the circling beasts, the approval. Minimal sentence variety; heavy reliance on compound structures and stock openers.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, but sustained metaphor density ("choking beauty," "velvet noose tightening with forgiveness," "beauty must strangle before they set you free") in nearly every paragraph becomes effortful without always advancing clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "willingly perplexed" is asserted three times in similar phrasing, and "choking beauty" recurs without progression. Register drift is evident—"Cloudbound repentance called her," "Accumulating Veil," "fragmented life whole"—elevated diction that clashes with the immediate physical state (blood loss, nursing). Template cadence in the closing lines: "perplexed no longer by choice, but by grace" and "not loss, but return" follow a mechanical toggle pattern. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops, metaphor density without payoff, and register drift; −0.3 for template cadence in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.4)
    Template cadence pervades: "The shadow lunged…She extended…She began the action of stitch…Suddenly, a pivotal shift" mirrors outline phrasing. Paraphrase loops cluster in the closure third—"the tapestry grew, a quilt of integrated darkness pulsing with nascent light" restates "Each stitch bound a fragment: rage into resolve, guilt into grace" without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("like dandelion seed in zero-g," "reality quivered as the barrier yielded") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the weight," "felt a tremor," "felt…lighter") dull immediacy in peak beats. Pen-ultimate paragraph: "Her motivation crystallized" is scaffold exposition mid-climax. Per the penalty pack, template cadence + loops + filter stacks in closure third yield −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    Heavy overwriting pervades: "vibrant hush," "whispering hush," "slow dance of celestial bodies," and "texture of transformation" recur as unearned poetic stock phrases without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("a vibrant hush cloaked the world" / "The whispering hush deepened"), and template cadence runs in the opening ("He had given away… his final jar… Now, penniless…"). Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: "light as sea foam" while "clutched a weathered satchel" contradicts weightlessness; "miniature auroras" for bugs inflates scale. Figurative density in the climax (fireflowers, silent symphony, velvet breath) obscures propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 baseline plus additional deductions for spread, and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work (bugs pulse "in rhythm with the aligning planets"), but scaffold redundancy and synonym churn drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe text-artifact penalties apply. Paraphrase loops pervade: "winking hush" appears in paragraphs 4, 13, 24, and 37; "cradle of sparks" in 9, 15, 24, 38; "calmly inventive" in 1, 10, 16, 37. Template cadence dominates with repetitive "[Subject] [past-tense verb], [gerund phrase]" stems across 20+ sentences. Stock metaphors accumulate without tension: "thief in velvet gloves," "twilight's sly grin," "shadows conspiring." The final paragraph stacks scaffold sentences—"The winking hush deepened," "Her motivation fulfilled in flickers," "Twilight faded, but the hush endured"—that restate closure rather than dramatize it. Figurative density (metaphor in nearly every line) obscures rather than sharpens action in peak beats, triggering overwriting penalties per Q7 guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high in the rock-placement sequence, where each beat advances both action and symbolic weight. The opening establishes voice and stakes efficiently. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "The dust shimmered with trapped infinities, particles of a dead sun" is restated as "star-dust slurry" and "dust's wild energy" without added pressure. The staccato final third employs sentence fragments purposefully to create cadence shift, but some lines ("Eels settled, sequences glowing faint in afterlight" / "Kael sat, watching aurora fade to true dawn") feel like variations on the same closing gesture. Filter verbs ("he saw her face") appear but don't stack densely enough to harm immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive overwriting and template cadence undermine clarity and momentum. The text loops concepts obsessively: "furiously tranquil" appears three times, "cartography of scars" six times, "rarefy" / "rarefying" five times, "storm-kissed wonder" twice, often in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Paraphrase loops abound ("masks slip" is restated three times; the vigil/pause/resume cycle is churned across multiple beats). Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in high-pressure moments—"thunder applauded," "dawn pierced," "lightning crowned"—blurring rather than sharpening the action. Runs of identical sentence stems ("He paced," "He sat," "He sealed") across the middle third create drumbeat monotony. Mixed metaphors proliferate: scars function simultaneously as maps, stars, meridians, and tissue without coherent physical logic. The final third collapses into abstract summary ("legacy began to rarefy the air, thinning veils until only truth remained") in place of concrete image, and the closing line recycles prior phrasing verbatim. These artifacts touch the closure beat directly, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "diplomatically fierce" appears three times, "dignified chaos" four times, "questions into destinations" twice, all without added pressure. Template cadence in duel beats ("parry, thrust, riposte weaving"; "They circled, breaths syncing") flattens momentum. Stock metaphors ("blades singing," "minds afire") and elevated register ("prised," "finale") drift from the scene's urgency. Information density is low; multiple lines restate stance without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe overwriting pervades: "luminous shards," "star-pricked vault," "molted his latest personality," "luminous fracture of gravel and melody" cluster without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causality in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops: "forge beauty from anarchy" recurs in lines 20, 28, 46, and the final poem without reweighting. Template cadence: "Elias [verb]...Mira [verb]..." runs across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphors: "blooming resistance" versus "forge beauty" versus "luminous fracture" never cohere. The −0.3 to −0.7 density penalty, −0.4 paraphrase-loop penalty, and −0.4 template-cadence penalty compound to approximately −1.5 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat (final poem), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.6)
    Template cadence and scaffold phrasing pervade the piece: multiple paragraphs open with "Elias [verb]" or single-word sentence fragments ("Intrigued." "There."). Stock metaphors cluster in high-pressure beats ("horizon invites night" recurs three times; "steely longing" appears five times unchanged). Paraphrase loops: "strategically creative" and "tactician" restate the same trait across adjacent lines without added pressure. The final third stacks declarative summary—"Fate recoiled; the clock shuddered… Tides hushed, compasses glowed"—that tells transformation rather than showing it through concrete action. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "arbor groaning like a colossal organ," "foam that shimmered like lost stars," "refuge gleamed," all within ten lines, muddling clarity. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: "luminous" appears 8 times, "whimsical" 7 times, often in template phrases ("empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt"). Adjacent lines paraphrase without added pressure ("doubt shadowed her luminous path" / "doubt gnawed"). Metaphor density is high in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff ("petals unfurled across the ancient ridge in bloom, casting a golden haze that flickered like fireflies in doubt"). Filter verbs stack in the dream sequence ("She traced threads," "interpreting," "revealing"). Artifactual loops and decorative modifiers dull momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive template cadence and synonym loops: "rhythmically placid" appears three times, "slow-spoken" twice, "diffuse/diffused/diffusing" seven times across adjacent lines without pattern payoff. Paraphrase loops in final third ("cerulean regret" echoed four times in closure paragraph; "unspoken apologies" three times). Mixed metaphors: "heart severed" then "unmoored," "tides carry hues" then "diffuse the anchors." Stock phrases: "voice fracturing," "tears traced her cheeks," "heart lighter." Template stems: "Elara [verb]" opens six sentences in three paragraphs. Artifacts touch closure, triggering baseline −1.4 and disallowing 9+ globally; final-third concentration escalates to −1.7 total, capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is generally clear and fluid, with some striking images (leaf veins revealed by precise erosion, mirrors unfogging into sharper reflections). However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts (“preprocesses reality,” “needless drama,” decay-as-essence) and a mild tendency toward abstract, theme-label language over concrete action in later paragraphs. A few sentences are syntactically awkward or overloaded, and some beats paraphrase prior ones rather than adding new pressure. The prose is solid but not yet ruthlessly distilled for maximum precision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often striking and image-rich; phrases like “frost-lit foray” and “luminous orb…blinding resonance” are memorable and dense with function. However, the line-level texture leans toward repetition and mild purple prose, especially with recurring abstractions (“steadily adaptive,” “drifting resonance,” “pauses”) that are restated rather than freshly developed. Some sentences perform similar conceptual work in adjacent lines, slightly dragging momentum. Clarity remains intact throughout, but tighter cuts and a bit more variance in register would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally graceful, with strong imagery and efficient rhythm, and most sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, and motion). However, there is some purple edging (“gleaming like frozen stars,” “radiant mosaic,” “chorus of souls”) and a tendency to restate concepts in slightly varied language, adding a trace of redundancy. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; it rarely muddies meaning or causality. Tightening a few ornamental phrases would heighten impact and move the piece closer to elite-line precision.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and musical, with strong images like “bioluminescent anemones pulsed like hesitant heartbeats” doing multiple jobs of setting, mood, and theme. Line-level clarity remains high despite the lyricism; cause and effect are easy to track, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is occasional risk of purple richness, but metaphors largely cohere and don’t obscure action. A tad more sparing use of modifiers in a few sentences would tighten momentum to elite-magazine sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically pleasing, and free of major scaffolding or loop artifacts; sentences often carry multiple functions (world, mood, theme). Recurrent phrases like “gently persistent” and “amplified quiet” approach overuse but function as motifs rather than pure redundancy. Some lines flirt with purple (“lanterns bobbing like malevolent fireflies”), yet they remain intelligible and aligned with tone. Information density and sequence clarity are strong, supporting smooth momentum despite the summary-heavy structure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, high information density, and vivid imagery that does multiple jobs at once. The prose sustains a consistent aesthetic without major clarity issues or scaffoldy repetition, and key beats are shown rather than summarized. There is some purple overlap and diction echo (“foggy lucidity,” “spiritually curious,” “sparks” as a repeated intensifier) that risks slight over-saturation. Still, the language mostly feels deliberate and propulsive, supporting rather than obscuring the scene’s emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with strong information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once. However, figurative language is stacked heavily (“quaking reverie,” “pulsing with sap like veins of forgotten epochs,” “fractal spirals that mirrored the maze’s infinite expanse”), tipping into purple and occasionally feeling redundant. Some concepts are restated with near-synonym churn rather than fresh development. The lyricism works overall but would benefit from selective pruning and a few plainer lines to sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences flow, syntax is varied, and images are clear and often striking. The prose tends toward density and ornament, occasionally bordering on purple (“bombs from rebel forces shearing its base, the timeframe of liberation arriving in a cascade of dust and screams”), but rarely at the expense of comprehension. A few modifiers and intensifiers could be trimmed to sharpen impact and momentum, especially in high-action beats. There are no major loops, grammatical issues, or figurative muddles that damage the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is rich and mostly controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“bellows groaning like drowned sailors,” “a cavern hollowed from volcanic pumice”). Information density is high and there’s little outright redundancy. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and cumulative metaphor density veers into purple at times, softening impact and slightly slowing momentum. Tightening a few stacked images in peak beats would sharpen clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty with imagery and narrative movement. However, there is noticeable repetition of certain adjectives and constructs (luminous, illuminated, emerald, golden) that occasionally feel like paraphrase loops rather than fresh advances. Figurative density runs high across the whole piece, flirting with purple prose without quite obscuring sense. The closure beat remains crisp despite the ornament, so the main impact is mild momentum drag rather than true opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are syntactically varied, images are often striking, and most lines do multiple jobs (world, mood, character). Yet figurative density is very high—mock-heroic declarations, repeated heart/thaw metaphors, and stacked modifiers occasionally feel overwrought rather than sharpened. There are minor redundancies (e.g., “thoughtfully spirited” twice) and some familiar metaphors amid the fresher ones. The prose is polished and energetic but could benefit from selective restraint to reach elite precision.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.0)
    There are striking lines and images (e.g., “voice like waves over gravel”), and many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and plot. Yet the prose often leans into density and ornament—“veined with iridescent whispers,” “transformative betrayal”—that verge on purple and slow momentum. The bracketed self-revisions in the climax are significant artifacts that disrupt flow and clarity, making the resolution feel patched on the page. Some conceptual redundancy (“trembling certainty,” “firmly adaptive”) and high-level abstractions could be pruned for tighter impact.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose contains striking phrases and strong sensory density, but it often leans into purple territory with stacked metaphors and repeated textures (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” “veining”) that start to blur rather than sharpen. There is some paraphrase/idea looping around hush, silence, and veining that could be tightened for momentum. Most critically, the explicit scaffolding about word counts and “story caps at 756 total” is a severe artifact that derails immersion and undermines line-level polish. These issues collectively mark the piece as unrefined despite evident talent.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many sentences serving both atmosphere and concept. There are occasional repetitions and mildly purple constructions (“eternal return in the everyday,” “mundane mysticism’s quiet triumph”) that add a touch of gloss rather than depth. Still, clarity is maintained, and the closing images (violin sublimating, broom whispering) land effectively. Trimming some abstract rephrasing of the same insight would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose often achieves a lush, musical cadence and strong images (“each glistening facet murmuring faint echoes of forgotten melodies” is effective). Yet figurative language is dense and sometimes repetitive, and key terms (whispers, hush, transparency, mistrust, ambiguously clear) recur in ways that flatten impact. A few sentences restate ideas rather than advancing them, contributing to a slight sense of purple drift rather than relentless precision. Line-level clarity remains good, but the piece would benefit from cutting and sharpening to meet elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and often elegant, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and thematic echo. There is some risk of purple-leaning metaphor stacks and abstract phrasing (“mended deception,” “collective ill fortune”) that could be sharpened, but they rarely obscure causality or scene logic. Line-level momentum generally holds, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. A light edit could trim a few overworked phrases, but the craft is solidly above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose shows ambition and a willingness to work with rich imagery and rhythm, and many individual lines are evocative. At the same time, modifiers and figurative language are often stacked (“icy warmth,” “frozen auroras,” “multidimensional lattices of light-encoded magnetism”) to the point of slight purple excess, which can blur rather than sharpen impact. There are minor repetition/loop artifacts (meta corrections about word count and purity of story) that break flow and feel like scaffolding left on the page. Tighter line-editing and pruning of decorative phrases would significantly increase clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has strong moments of lyricism and good information density—sentences tend to advance atmosphere and plot together. There is some purple edging and a few clichés or near-clichés (“orchestra pit of his soul,” “ignited, ready to disrupt the world’s silence”) and a bit of conceptual redundancy near the end. Still, syntax is clear, grammar solid, and action order legible even in the chaotic flooding sequence. Line-level craft is good but not yet at the razor-sharp minimalism or surprising precision top venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character. However, figurative language is extremely frequent (“auroral sorrow,” “veins like lightning,” “sorrow’s auroral shimmer,” “knife-edge peak”), flirting with purple prose and creating a slight sense of saturation. There is also some conceptual repetition (fault-tolerance, swaying certainties, margins) that could be tightened without loss of meaning. These choices don’t obscure causality or closure, but they do slow momentum and reduce the impact of individual images.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; many sentences carry both atmosphere and character insight. Key images (beads embedded like a curse, beads snapping free, ghost shift “in his mind’s eye”) are clear and well-chosen. There is some mild repetition of favored constructions and a slight tilt toward purple abstraction (“weight of a swallowed truth,” “precise heft of swallowed sin”), but it stops short of obscuring sense or momentum. Line-level craft is publishable, though a small trim of conceptual redundancy would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence. Some repetition and near-purple diction (“drift of untold seasons” twice, conceptual labels like “core concept”) slightly blunt momentum, but do not obscure causality or the closure image. Figurative language remains internally consistent—libraries, pages, stone, and rivers—and the final lines land clearly instead of dissolving into abstraction. Trimming a few redundant modifiers and conceptual restatements would bring this closer to elite literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often beautiful, with strong images like “his voice like whispering wind” and the curl “soft as dawn light.” At the same time, modifiers and figurative language are dense and occasionally repetitive (“softly adaptive,” “ordinary magic,” “hush”), nudging into mild purple-prose territory. Several sentences do similar emotional work in adjacent lines, creating a touch of redundancy and softening momentum. Despite these issues, clarity and the closure image remain intact, and most lines carry both atmosphere and narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with dense, multi-tasking sentences and vivid metaphor (“pages curled like dying leaves,” “stories flowed freely—dragons roaring silently, diarists weeping ink”). The lyric texture is consistent and rarely muddled, though figurative language is frequent enough that some lines verge on decorative rather than necessary. Repetition of certain constructions and phrases (“bronze quiet,” “displaced axis”) borders on incantatory but remains controlled. There are no significant clarity issues, syntactic errors, or scaffold loops that sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally fluent and rhythmic, with some strong images and efficient summary of backstory. There is noticeable overwriting and repetition—phrases like “familiar enigma” and extended metaphors about fog, keys, and orchestration recur enough to feel like pattern but also like stylistic clutter. Several sentences carry two or three metaphors at once, edging toward purple and slightly dulling impact and momentum. Still, clarity of action is preserved, and there are few outright redundant or confusing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is lush and highly patterned, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. Repetition (“decorated with silence,” “muffled clarity”) mostly functions as intentional motif tied to the loop-pedal conceit, not careless looping. There is some purple-prose density and near-synonym intensification that could be trimmed without loss, and a few abstractions slightly blur rather than sharpen images. Nonetheless, rhythm, clarity, and momentum hold through the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong cadence, vivid metaphor, and generally high information density; most lines do double duty for mood and meaning. Recurring formulations (“upturned hush,” “chronologically homesick”) function more as motif than deadweight, and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym churn. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, occasionally flirting with purple and slightly flattening impact through saturation. Trimming a few redundant intensifiers and abstractions would sharpen the already strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is generally grammatical, rhythmic, and imagistic, with many sentences doing multiple jobs of mood and world-building. However, figurative density is high almost everywhere (“darkening brightness,” “procedural unraveling,” etc.), creating occasional purple-prose drag and a sense of repetition around a limited set of coined terms. Several adjacent sentences restate similar ideas about fractured timelines and regeneration, which could be tightened for momentum. While clarity survives, a leaner approach in the middle and at the climax would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“horn flared like a petrified shout”) and good information density; most sentences advance both atmosphere and story. Some metaphor and phrase repetition (“filament of hush,” “audibly muted,” seasonal rustle) verge on overuse, nudging toward a slight purple sheen but not enough to obscure meaning. There are no major loops, scaffolding, or syntactic glitches, and rhythm modulates well between description and action. Overall line craft is above the typical submission standard, though a light pruning of repeated motifs would sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with varied syntax, effective imagery, and good information density; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some purple/echoing diction (“layered tranquility,” “nurturing integrity,” repeated storm metaphors) and a tendency toward stacked modifiers that occasionally feel ornamental rather than clarifying. Nonetheless, rhythm is mostly smooth, clarity remains intact, and there are no major scaffold or repetition artifacts that drag momentum. Tightening a few over-decorated lines would bring the prose closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid verbs, layered images, and good information density with few wasted sentences. Some metaphors and modifiers stack to the edge of purple (“crystal shadows,” “twilight bled into night,” “invisible fire,” “molecular ghosts”), creating a lush but occasionally over-saturated texture. There are minor paraphrase-adjacent moments where emotional states are named after being shown, particularly around “impact of memories” and “core concept,” which slightly blunt momentum. Overall, rhythm and clarity hold, but a light trim of abstractions and repeated image-types would sharpen the piece for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “veins of forgotten lightning” and “silken regrets, its razor joys” are vivid, and most sentences pull double duty for mood and information. The rhythm generally flows, and there are few, if any, syntactic or grammatical missteps. That said, the density of figurative language and repeated abstract phrases edges into mild purple prose, with some conceptual redundancy (“texture of time” and “impossible choices” reasserted rather than deepened). Trimming a few reiterations and letting a concrete image stand without conceptual gloss would increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level writing is often beautiful, with strong sensory images and efficient scene-setting—many sentences do double duty for mood and world-building. There is some over-writing and redundancy, especially in the closing run of staccato statements (“Beauty found, forever seeking. / In simplicity, the grandest tale. / The end hovered, yet never fell.”), which paraphrase each other more than they add new pressure or image. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and not mutually contradictory. Tightening the closing paragraph and trimming a few abstract formulations would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and images that often do double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“casting long shadows that danced like half-remembered dreams”). However, the prose occasionally leans toward purple and repetitive motif-restatement—“professionally thorough,” “affectionate detachment,” “half-truths”—where slight cutting would heighten impact. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; it rarely muddies action or causality. Momentum holds across the scene, with few true scaffold sentences or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with sound syntax and few outright cluttered sentences, and there’s evident control over rhythm in longer, flowing lines. At the same time, there’s a tendency toward stacked modifiers and slightly overwrought phrasing that don’t always earn their keep, especially in the closing paragraphs. Occasional repetition of key adjectives and concepts creates a faint sense of scaffolding. Nothing here breaks clarity, but tightening and pruning could sharpen impact and reduce the sentimental sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery and a good sense of cadence; sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) at once. However, the density of figurative language and repeated abstractions (“luminescent ache,” “boldly sympathetic,” “webs of kinship”) sometimes verges on purple and can blur rather than sharpen impact. There are mild redundancies in how yearning and connection are described, though they don’t obscure causality or closure. Tighter selection of metaphors and a few strategic plainer beats would heighten contrast and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, imagery is striking, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. However, the density of figurative language and modifiers is very high (“twisting forms of frozen figures—dancers mid-leap, birds half-winged—that shimmered with unnatural light”), which occasionally tips toward purple and risks numbing impact. There are minor conceptual redundancies around the “interrupted cadence” explanation that could be tightened without loss. Overall, the prose is polished and musical, just shy of the ruthless economy expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is lush and generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding (e.g., “moonlight pierced the cavern's vaulted fissures like silver needles”). There is some repetition of motifs and constructions (dovetail imagery, “gently inventive,” heavily layered metaphors) that tip toward overwriting but do not seriously obscure meaning or momentum. Figurative language is dense yet mostly coherent, and there is little scaffolding or synonym churn. For a top-tier market, a slight tightening and occasional restraint on metaphor density would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and action; there are few, if any, true redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt (“heating ducts snaked like petrified rivers,” “ferric tang”) and doesn’t obscure basic causality. However, the density of metaphor and color adjectives in some stretches pushes toward purple, slightly diluting impact through accumulation. The final beats remain clear and rhythmically satisfying, so the stylistic excess is a minor drag rather than a structural problem.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose shows good rhythm and strong, often striking images, and most sentences carry both atmosphere and narrative function. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts (storm season, releasing control, sustaining transformation, circuitous sincerity) that sometimes restate rather than deepen the moment. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; a few lines feel like paraphrase loops summarizing the same internal stance with new wording. Tightening redundancies and varying some constructions would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line by line, the prose is rich, image-dense, and mostly purposeful, often doing double duty for setting and interiority (“kelp clung like war banners,” “dragonfly poised at the nexus of it all”). There is some repetition and near-purple phrasing—“haggard awe,” “wryly earnest,” “thresh meaning”/“thresh the awe”—that slightly dulls impact and risks self-consciousness. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and momentum generally holds despite the lyricism. Tightening a few stacked modifiers and repeated motifs would lift clarity and keep the strongest images from competing with one another.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmic, with some strong images (“shadows pooled like ink,” “mother’s milk solidified”), and sentences generally carry both atmosphere and story. That said, there is a tendency toward purple density and repetition of similar effects (“steadily unpredictable” appears twice, overlapping-shadow phrasing recurs) without added pressure. Several lines tell emotional or mystical states in abstract terms (“visions flooded her mind like crystal songs,” “she glimpsed truth”) where a more concrete dramatization would sharpen impact. Momentum holds, but tighter pruning and more varied sentence dynamics would improve propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong images (“ivory walls veined with salt-crusted shelves,” “spray a silver veil”) and mostly clean rhythm. At times, modifiers and abstractions stack up (“compile these fragments into meaning,” “curated absences,” “profound meaning”), flirting with purple prose and slight redundancy. A few near-paraphrase moments and conceptual repeats around fragments/absences could be tightened for greater punch. Clarity remains good throughout; closure is not obscured by line-level issues.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) and maintain momentum, and grammar and sequencing are clean. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and on-theme (cartographic, celestial, architectural), and key beats are dramatized rather than summarized. There is some rhetorical redundancy and a tendency toward purple intensifiers (“analytically artistic masterpieces,” “eternal cartography”) that could be pared back for even greater impact. Still, clarity survives the lushness and the closure image is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for image, mood, and character. There is some repetition of key formulations (“courageously kind,” “sculpted space for reflection,” “unheard symphony”) that reads slightly mechanical rather than artfully patterned. Figurative language remains coherent and on-theme, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. Tightening a few redundant phrases would sharpen impact but the line-level craft is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and often striking, with high information density—most sentences do atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotional work simultaneously. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, pushing the piece toward purple prose; images like “whispered secrets in hushed thunder” and “spatial mutiny” stack metaphors in ways that occasionally blur precision. There are minor redundancy patterns (thunder/hush reiterated, storm-related descriptors clustering) that slightly drag momentum. Despite this, line-level clarity at the climax and closure remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is vivid and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding, and rhythm generally supports momentum. However, there is a noticeable tendency toward purple/overwrought phrasing and stacked metaphors (“sterile air humming… mimicked arterial glow,” “chemical zest like overripe fruit on the edge of rot”), some of which could be trimmed without loss. A few conceptual restatements (e.g., fairness/balance/ledgers) verge on redundancy. Despite these, clarity at the climax and closure is preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, packing high information density into many lines (e.g., the textures of medieval wool, Edwardian ballroom floors, papyrus and cordite layered together). Metaphoric language is largely coherent and thematically aligned—light, texture, and refracted time recur purposefully. However, the density of imagery flirts with purple; nearly every sentence is figurative, which slightly flattens impact and risks reader fatigue in a top-tier venue. There are no major clarity or rhythm failures, but a leaner line in key beats would sharpen momentum and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, rhythmic, and dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere, theme, and plot. Motifs like “layered,” “fragments,” “texture,” and “tide” recur in ways that mostly feel like design, but there are moments where repetition borders on redundancy rather than fresh accretion. Line-by-line, clarity is high and there’s little scaffolding or syntactic monotony, though some metaphors (“core concept of erased histories that permeated this rusting maze”) tilt toward abstract, slightly purple formulation. Trimming a handful of near-duplicate formulations would lift the piece into a leaner, more lethal register suitable for top venues.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for mood and theme (“Legends spoke…whispering a universal riddle”). Sentence rhythm varies, and there are few outright redundancies or clarity issues. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous—“time itself turned a final leaf,” “grim ballet,” “eternity’s whisper”—creating a mild purple cast that risks dulling impact and occasionally feels like conceptual restatement rather than new insight. Tightening a few of the more abstract metaphors and trimming repetition around “whispers,” “hums,” and “pages” would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is mostly clean, with good information density and a strong sense of rhythm, especially in the early paragraphs describing Aquafeste. There are some repetition and scaffold issues—recurrent abstract phrases like “hopeful desperation,” “dual allegiance,” and an ending that stacks short declarative sentences into a near-mantra. A few lines verge on slogan or tag-line (“Allegiance to the Float,” “Carnival forever”), diluting the otherwise vivid descriptive language. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, and line-level craft rarely obstructs momentum or understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is largely polished, with strong, specific images and a good sense of rhythm; many sentences do double duty by advancing both atmosphere and character. However, there are noticeable repetition patterns (“purposefully curious” twice, “dawnlit melancholy,” “outlast” and “last” motifs voiced rather than implied) and some purple-leaning lines that restate the same mood without adding pressure. Figurative language clusters in places (“ghostly silver,” “clawing shadows,” “frozen tear,” “melancholy veil”) risk over-saturating the texture and slightly dulling impact. These issues don’t break clarity or closure, but they do keep the line-level from feeling razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and often striking, with strong sensory images like the anchor chain’s “steady clanks” and the refraction “prismatic rainbows” doing multiple jobs at once. There is some tendency toward purple density—stacked modifiers and repeated metaphoric framings of breath, hums, whispers—that slightly over-sweeten the texture. A few lines paraphrase similar emotional content (Elias’s passion, calm, mastery) without adding new pressure. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and the closure image is not muddied by figurative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, vivid, and information-dense, with few wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but usually apt, and momentum rarely stalls despite the lyric density. Some images and phrasings repeat similar notes (“worrying tranquility,” multiple layered metaphors for the lake and silence), flirting with over-saturation. Clarity at key beats—the vellum reveal, condensation pattern, and departure—remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The line-level writing is often vivid and musical, with strong images like “mortar knitting like healed flesh” and “lanterns igniting with inner glow.” Yet the density of modifiers and repeated key phrases leads to mild purple-prose drag and a sense of synonym churn around the same few ideas (hush, balance, cryptic, infinite patience). Several adjacent sentences restate similar content about footsteps, rhythm, and revival without adding new pressure. The prose is competent and occasionally striking, but would benefit from tightening and more variation in imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, rhythmically varied, and rich in sensory detail, with many lines doing double duty for mood and information. However, there is noticeable repetition (“time ran short,” “lonesome splendor,” variations on “ephemeral”) and a tendency toward stacked abstractions that push into mild purple prose. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar content (oxygen urgency, instinct vs resolve) without adding new pressure. Tightening modifiers and trimming redundancies would sharpen the impact and keep the imagery from feeling over-saturated.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong information density—most lines carry setting, mood, and thematic freight simultaneously. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, especially around “copperlight,” “repose,” and “hush,” which risks purple drift and diminishes contrast at peak beats. There are minor redundancy loops (rephrasing similar ideas about hush, scuffs, or sustaining impossibilities) that could be tightened. Clarity of action and causality remains intact, so the main issue is excess ornament rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich imagery and good information density—most sentences pull weight for atmosphere and plot simultaneously. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and emotional labels (e.g., “mournful elation,” “loving venom,” “over the hush…”) that sometimes restate rather than deepen, creating mild loopiness. Figurative language is lush but mostly coherent, avoiding true metaphor muddle, and clarity of action is maintained even at the climax. Trimming redundant rephrasings and varying emotional diction would tighten momentum and heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is lush and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some density of figurative language and repeated qualifiers (“hauntingly optimistic,” “orchid solace,” multiple “bloom”/“blossom” images) that nudge the prose toward purple but do not seriously impede clarity. Momentum is maintained despite lyricism; each paragraph advances situation or reweights meaning. Minor redundancy in thematic phrasing and modifier stacking keeps this short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose often achieves striking imagery (“apple blossoms drifting onto bones,” “shadow slicing precisely across the bone-strewn ground”) and maintains clarity despite its lyric density. Most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and action, keeping confusion at bay. Still, there is noticeable repetition of key adjectives and constructions, plus occasional near-paraphrase about interrupted journeys and restoration, which slightly dulls momentum. Trimming echoing phrases and varying figurative texture would sharpen line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong rhythm, varied sentence structures, and generally efficient dual-purpose sentences (worldbuilding plus character, or tone plus action). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically relevant (e.g., “tiles that shimmered like forgotten holograms”). There is mild purple-prose pressure—many adjectives and metaphors in close succession—but it doesn’t create confusion or stall momentum. Very little obvious scaffolding or repetition appears, keeping the piece lean for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, evocative, and compact, often carrying atmosphere, character, and worldbuilding at once. There is some purple edging—figurative language in many lines and a few near-redundant beats about silence and autumn—that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness. Still, the prose maintains momentum, and crucial beats (the detection of forgery, the handoff to the courier, the closing return to the candle) remain crisp and legible. No major syntactic or logical artifacts interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    The line-level writing is often vivid and musical, with strong images like “twisted roots and brackish tides” and “glass-like mangrove leaves” that carry thematic weight. However, the prose frequently tips into overwriting: stacked modifiers, repeated abstractions (regret, fierce tenderness, unsent letters) and slightly muddled phrasing (“Uns sent letters”) create a sense of synonym-churn. Several beats paraphrase similar emotional content in adjacent sentences, which could be tightened for momentum. These issues don’t break clarity but do dull the impact enough to hold it below elite craft.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme, and the rhythm generally supports the meditative pace. However, figurative density is very high—“lotus-hearted” appears twice, and multiple metaphors stack in close proximity—pushing toward overwriting. There is some conceptual redundancy (re-describing the same ache or misty atmosphere) that could be tightened for a top-tier venue. Despite this, clarity is maintained and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains many strong images and generally clean syntax, and line-level clarity is rarely in doubt. Yet figurative and abstract language is very dense—“pensive mirth,” “daydream’s fold,” “eternal haze,” “luminous arcs”—with noticeable repetition that creates a faint purple, padded quality. Several adjacent sentences restate similar emotional states or atmospheric effects instead of advancing pressure or specificity. With tighter selection and a bit less ornament, the same material could land more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are fluent, sensory, and multi-tasking, and the prose supports the chosen lyric mode. There is some density bloat—compound metaphors (“thoughts bloomed like overripe echoes,” “fracturing like glass under sonic pressure”) stack, and certain motifs (“nested,” “methodically playful”) recur more as ornament than pressure. Still, clarity remains intact and momentum through the central bewitchment sequence does not stall. A slight trim of adornment and a few more concrete, un-metaphored beats would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. There is, however, a near-constant strain of metaphor and alliteration (“chaos converged,” “candidly cryptic,” “reality folding like wet paper”), which sometimes feels overwrought and risks diminishing impact through repetition. Some phrases and structures recur in ways that read more like stylistic tics than deliberate patterning, especially in the final third. While clarity generally holds, a bit more restraint and variation would heighten the strongest images instead of crowding them.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with few if any grammatical or clarity issues. Figurative language is lush but mostly coherent and on-theme, and the prose carries both atmosphere and narrative momentum. The final stretch slides into near-chant, with repeated short sentences and recycled key terms that begin to feel like paraphrase-loops rather than fresh accrual. That repetition slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise sharp closure image but does not seriously obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and emotion, and there are few genuine redundancies or scaffolding lines. However, figurative language is heavily stacked (“foxglove regret,” “time’s indifferent tide,” “derelict laughter-mirrors”), creating a nearly unbroken high-intensity texture that risks blurring impact and slightly slowing momentum. A few constructions feel abstract or meta (“ignited the action”) rather than immediate, diluting immersion at key beats. Tightening modifiers and varying texture between calm and peak moments would sharpen clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft shows ambition and frequent beauty, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, but the prose sometimes tips into purple with stacked metaphors (“shadows clung to shelves like forgotten syllables,” “carefully reckless heart soared cautiously”) and repeated key phrases. There is mild conceptual redundancy around trust, silence, and the heart/ink/will triad without new pressure being added. Most importantly, the meta-textual intrusion about “simulate accurate count” and “write to 600–800” breaks immersion and reads like a generation artifact, dulling the closure image. These issues keep the piece from the tight, invisible line work expected at elite level despite its evident strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, syntactically varied, and carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) with good density. The main issue is overwriting via repeated motifs and near-synonymous intensifiers (“dappled,” “trembled,” “breathed,” “resolve”) that create a faint sense of template cadence and occasionally slow momentum. Some lines summarize emotional states or thematic points that have already been dramatized, adding mild redundancy. Nevertheless, the closure image is sharp and unblurred, and there are no serious figurative muddles or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images and multi-function lines that carry setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously. However, figurative language is very dense—nearly every paragraph leans on metaphors of blooming/withering, light, and echoes—which occasionally veers toward purple and risks dulling impact through repetition. Despite this, syntax is varied, clarity remains high, and there are few if any true scaffolding sentences or confusing constructions. Trimming or varying a few recurring images would likely sharpen rather than reduce the piece’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“wood felled from a tree that drank storms, grain recording aerial dances”). However, figurative language is present in nearly every sentence; repeated phrases and concept-stacking (“fractured hush,” “featherly determined,” multiple explicit restatements of “necessary distances”) verge on purple and slightly dull momentum. Despite this, grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final cadence is clear and well-shaped. Tighter pruning of repetitive conceptual statements would elevate the line-level further.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and image-rich, often doing layered work to build mood, world, and theme in each sentence. There are some repetitions (“softly ingenious,” “shadowseam wonder,” “luminous respite”) and stacked modifiers that drift toward purple, but they rarely obscure meaning. Momentum is generally preserved despite the density; there’s little true scaffolding or synonym-churn. Strong line-level craft, but it could benefit from a few strategic cuts for sharper contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is confident, with strong imagery (“captured sunlight like frozen fireworks,” “waves clapping in joy over submerged wrecks”) and generally clean syntax. However, figurative density is quite high, with frequent similes and metaphors that at times risk feeling like ornamental piling-on rather than adding new information. Some phrasal repetitions (“cheerful gloom,” “before memory fades”) verge on redundant instead of deepening. Even so, clarity is maintained, and momentum does not significantly stall.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is dense and musical, often doing multiple jobs at once (setting, theme, character) with lines like “a calculated wilderness where sea spray mingled with cotton candy scents.” There is some flirtation with purple—stacked modifiers and repeated motifs (“monotony,” “serendipity”)—but clarity and momentum are preserved, and key beats are not obscured. Sentences vary in length and cadence enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. I see little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines earn their place.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose shows strong rhythmic control and vivid metaphorical language, and most sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or filler. However, figurative density is very high—“obsidian grace,” “inner milk-fire,” “diaphanous wings of tidal mist,” “comet’s sigh,” “liquid starfire”—to the point where it occasionally feels like layered ornament rather than precision. There are mild paraphrase tendencies (reiterating exile, gaps, and verse in similar phrasing) that could be tightened for maximal impact. Still, clarity remains intact, and the overall craft is above-average; it simply needs some pruning and contrast to meet elite minimalism and incisiveness standards.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong cadence and high information density in most lines; images often do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Some metaphors and phrasing repeat motifs effectively (fog, prisms, fractures), but at times the language verges on purple (“like a lover’s breath,” stacked luminous modifiers), creating a mild sense of over-ornamentation. There are no major clarity issues or syntactic artifacts, and momentum mostly survives the lushness. Trimming a few redundant intensifiers would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Yet there’s noticeable purple tendency and repetition: phrases like “slow dance of celestial bodies,” “universal language,” “hard softness,” and “gently skilled” recur and edge into self-conscious prettiness. Several lines paraphrase the same idea in abstract terms, especially around enlightenment and universal pain, which slightly slows momentum in a short piece. Despite this, grammar and sequencing are clean, and the closure image remains legible and emotionally intact.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with high information density—many sentences do double duty as worldbuilding and thematic work. Some phrases and constructions recur (“serene upheaval,” “lucidly watchful,” formulaic abstractions), and figurative language is nearly continuous, risking mild purple overgrowth but rarely collapsing clarity. Momentum holds because each descriptive move advances either the ritual or the conceptual escalation. Tightening a few redundant abstractions would sharpen an already solid prose surface.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and plot. Metaphors are mostly coherent and on-theme, and there’s little scaffolding or obvious looped phrasing. At times the language verges on purple or stacked (“emerald tendrils that pulsed like veins in the humid air,” “walls wept seismic sorrow”), and the repetition of key motifs can feel hammered rather than elegantly threaded. Rhythm and clarity hold throughout, but a light paring of intensifiers and duplicate emphasis would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and sonically attentive; many sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, and worldbuilding at once). There is some repetition of phrases and motifs and a tendency toward stacked modifiers that flirt with purple prose, but clarity is rarely compromised. Momentum holds despite the lyrical density because each move adds a new facet—ritual, mechanics, backstory, effect—rather than pure rephrasing. No significant scaffold, filter-verb stacking, or metaphor muddle damages the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often striking—“cracks spiderwebbing the balustrades like scars on porcelain skin,” “a gentle tide eroding cliffs of enmity”—and generally clear. However, there is noticeable purple density and repetition, especially of key phrases (“operatively gentle,” “flawed beauty,” “slow dance of celestial bodies”), which sometimes feel like prompt artifacts rather than organic choices. Figurative language appears in a high proportion of sentences, occasionally diluting impact and slowing momentum in what is ostensibly a high-stakes scene. Even so, causality and closure remain legible, and line-level issues do not obscure the core action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and vivid, precise images; many sentences do double duty for setting, theme, and character. However, figurative language is frequent enough that a few lines feel redundant or slightly purple (“thunder’s lull reborn as roar,” “redemption’s threadbare veil”), and some concepts (his guilt and philanthropy-as-mask) are reiterated rather than advanced. Rhythm and clarity stay intact, and the final image of stormwater seeking the crack-map’s heart lands cleanly. Trimming a handful of near-duplicate insights would sharpen momentum without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often striking (“flakes drifted like forgotten promises”; “between sigh and smile”) and carries high information density in many lines. However, figurative language is nearly continuous—threads, lullabies, poetry, echoes, prisms—which occasionally tips into purple repetition rather than fresh sharpening. A few paraphrase-like restatements (e.g., multiple variants of her body becoming poetry) slightly blunt momentum. Rhythm and syntax are otherwise well handled and clarity is maintained through the climax and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line to line, the prose is polished, mostly concise, and often striking (“wielded puppets like scalpels,” “the dome, once a radar for distant threats, now scanned his soul’s horizon”). However, the density of repeated phrases and concepts creates a mild sense of paraphrase looping and over-insistence in places. A few lines slide toward slogan or abstraction, especially in the final third, which slightly dulls the closure image. Overall, momentum holds and the language is strong, but trimming and varying some motifs would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, mood, character, theme) and propel the accumulative texture without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is dense but usually precise (“ink in rosewater,” “Morse of light”), with few strained or mixed metaphors. There is a mild risk of saturation—nearly every line is embellished—yet clarity of action and image remains intact, including at the climax and ending. Tightening a handful of slightly redundant adjectives or phrases could further sharpen momentum but does not currently harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong—sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, and images like “light as the pour that would cast sound from shadow” are striking. However, figurative language is near-constant, and repeated phrases (“technically gentle,” “snowmelt ardor”) drift from motif into mannerism. The density of modifiers and metaphors risks purple prose and slightly dulls impact at the climax. Momentum survives, but some tightening and pruning would markedly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and efficient compression—most sentences carry atmosphere, worldbuilding, and theme simultaneously. However, figurative language is almost continuous, leading to occasional purple saturation and diminishing the impact of the best images; “precisely playful” especially becomes a tic. Some conceptual phrasing (“the why of paths that chose their walkers,” “decaying directive”) loops in slightly altered forms, feeling redundant rather than escalating. Rhythm and grammar remain clean, but a bit more restraint and variation would sharpen momentum and heighten key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clear and musical, with many lines carrying both image and worldbuilding work. However, figurative and adjectival density is high, leading to mild purple-prose drift and conceptual redundancy (e.g., repeating “empirically ironic,” “dusky harmony,” “reimagined” without new torque). Momentum occasionally sags under the weight of modifiers even though causality remains intelligible. Tightening loops and pruning decorative rhetoric would lift this into a more publishable register.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally strong, with good information density and some striking lines (“resentment dissolving like mist in the sanctuary's calm”). However, there is noticeable repetition of certain motifs and phrasings (“reappeared when needed,” “shifting grace”) and a tendency toward abstraction that borders on purple in places, which slightly dilutes impact. Sentences mostly carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, and emotional beat), but some could be tightened without loss. Despite these minor redundancies, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is strong and polished: sentences are varied, figurative language is mostly apt, and key images (glass mountains, translucent silk and starlight, frost like veins of quartz) carry multiple jobs at once. The story occasionally brushes against purple prose, but the density of imagery rarely muddies meaning or slows momentum. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each sentence tends to add new texture or move the ritual forward. The closing beats are especially clear and resonant, with no figurative muddle obscuring the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and image-rich, with good sentence-level variety and a high density of meaningful detail; most lines do at least two jobs. A few phrases verge on repetition (“feisty,” “breach,” “persist”) and there are moments bordering on purple, but clarity and momentum are maintained. Figurative language is largely coherent and grounded in the story’s imagery (roots, leaves, light), avoiding mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym churn, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and mostly clean, with strong imagery and good information density—few sentences feel wasted, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. However, figurative language is nearly constant, and motif repetition (“simply complicated,” “brightened disquiet,” “between first and last page”) sometimes becomes scaffolding rather than deepening, nudging into mild purple-prose territory. Clarity remains intact, but a touch more concrete grounding and less conceptual echoing would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose often carries high information density—many sentences do double duty with atmosphere and worldbuilding—and the musical metaphors are mostly coherent with the tone. Yet there is a tendency toward purple phrasing and stacked figurative language (“silence hummed an unheard symphony of rustling pages and whispering spines”) that risks saturation without always deepening meaning. Crucially, the bracketed self-referential comments about word count and “adjusting flow” are clear artifacts that rupture immersion and damage the closing cadence. Tightening figurative density and removing meta-scaffold would markedly improve line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally fluent and evocative, with many lines doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and syntax is clear without mechanical errors. There is some purple density—stacked modifiers, repeated conceptual phrases, and frequent figurative language—that can blunt impact and create a sense of sameness in the middle stretch. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about memory alteration and tone, which could be tightened. Nonetheless, momentum carries through to closure, and the final images are legible and musically phrased.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line by line, the prose is generally lucid, rhythmic, and pleasantly dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some tendency toward lushness—stacked modifiers and repeated abstractions around “clarity,” “complexity,” and “absence”—but it rarely muddles meaning. The major technical blemish is the sequence of meta-counting sentences near the end, which read as scaffolding rather than artful experimentation and noticeably puncture momentum and closure tone. Tightening those and pruning a few redundant formulations would lift the piece into a higher craft band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong cadence, vivid imagery, and generally efficient sentences that advance both mood and action. There is some density of figurative language and overlap in concept (“storm of sound and light,” “quiet in the storm,” “bloom of hush”) that occasionally borders on purple and creates minor redundancy. Nonetheless, clarity is never compromised, and the closure image—petals of hush dissolving into the air—is clean and evocative. Trimming a few near-duplicate metaphors would likely lift this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid metaphors, good syntactic variety, and efficient integration of exposition into image. However, figurative density is high, and some metaphors feel slightly ornamental or repeated (variations on “thistle-blown,” recurrent abstract labels like “hope” and “meaning”), adding a mild purple sheen. There is minimal genuine scaffolding or paraphrase looping, but a touch more concision and reliance on concrete action over reiterative thematic phrasing would heighten impact. Clarity is never seriously impaired, and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, imagery is vivid, and most lines perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and theme). There is some repetition and mild purple-prose density—especially in the recurrence of key phrases and layered modifiers—which can blur impact and verge on redundancy. Nonetheless, causality and closure remain clear, and there are no major syntactic or clarity failures. Tightening duplicative formulations would lift it closer to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and the rhythm alternates effectively between longer, lush lines and tighter beats around key actions (igniting, launching). Imagery is generally precise and coherent, with recurrent fire/light metaphors that feel intentional rather than scattered. There is some borderline purple density—several consecutive figurative phrases where one might suffice—but it rarely obscures sense or momentum. Redundancy and scaffold lines are minimal, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.7)
    The line-level craft is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and dense, multi-function imagery that mostly remains legible and purposeful. Motifs like shells, nacre, and textures of time create a coherent figurative field, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or redundant explanation. That said, there is mild overwriting and motif repetition (“texture of time,” “transition periods,” and similar abstractions recur), which occasionally flattens impact and risks feeling thematic-first instead of scene-led. None of this obscures causality or closure, but it does keep the prose from a lean, fully honed top-tier finish.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“vines snagging her clothes, compressing her into a cradle of green that mimicked buried earth”). Rhythm and sentence length vary enough to maintain momentum, and there are few if any scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A handful of repeated coined phrases and dense modifiers edge toward over-ornamentation but do not obscure sense or dull the closure image. Line-level control is strong enough for high-tier publication with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, and most metaphors are legible and thematically aligned. There is, however, a tendency toward purple density—stacked modifiers and frequent figurative language—that occasionally feels ornamental rather than necessary, especially with repeated signature phrases. Some moments restate a point in slightly different wording (e.g., silence as comfort/teacher) without adding pressure. Despite this, causality and closure remain clear, and the prose never becomes so overwrought that it obscures the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and effective rhythm; sentences often do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and micro-advancement of plot). However, figurative language and modifiers are stacked heavily (“kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “prismatic nano-mists refracted aurora lights into shattering rainbows”), which occasionally edges toward purple and risks numbing impact. There are mild synonymic echoes around nostalgia and bloom but no serious loops or scaffolding, and clarity of action is preserved. Tightening a few over-ornate lines and varying texture would elevate it into a more austere, precise register suitable for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often striking (“silence hung heavy like unspent breath”; “bridges carefully ashen”), with good information density and mostly clean syntax. However, figurative language is very dense and somewhat repetitive—“loaded emptiness,” “ashen charcoal,” “shadows” and “scars” recur in similar configurations, creating a slight sense of synonym churn and overwriting. A few lines paraphrase nearby ideas without adding pressure (e.g., multiple restatements of why he left and what he’s teaching her). Pruning those and varying imagery would tighten momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose offers many striking images and a strong rhythmic flow; several sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, with frequent modifiers and concept-heavy phrases that can blur impact and slow momentum. Some ideas are restated in slightly different wording (pressure→diamonds, quantum promises, shadowseams) without always adding new pressure or insight. The line-level craft is above average but would benefit from selective pruning and a sharper contrast between high-intensity and quieter lines.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning. However, figurative language and ornate modifiers are nearly continuous, and some repetition (“eloquently silent,” “bridge of intuition,” “golden shadows”) becomes noticeable scaffolding rather than intensification. A slight sense of purple-prose excess and over-explanation of already-clear motifs dulls momentum in places. Clarity remains intact, but tightening could elevate impact significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatical, information is clear, and many images carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and theme) at once. The prose, however, veers into purple territory with frequent stacked modifiers and repeated signature phrases (“factually mystical,” “shivering bliss,” “endless night”) that create a sense of redundancy. Some lines feel like paraphrases of earlier ones in more ornate language rather than genuine progression. Trimming a third of the modifiers and consolidating repeated concepts would markedly sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, image-rich, and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Occasionally it verges on purple or repetitive—dust and light get multiple ornate treatments, and phrases like “tactfully hopeful nature whispering” feel a bit ornamental—yet clarity and momentum are preserved. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are no major grammatical or logical slips. Trimming a few descriptive flourishes and explicit thematic statements would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is mostly clean and fluent, with good momentum and some lines that efficiently carry atmosphere and plot. There is a tendency toward purple or stacked figurative language (“sun bled orange into gutters,” “prismatic signals of solidarity,” “plans reborn from unraveling”) that risks redundancy and dilutes impact. Several sentences echo similar structures and intensifiers, creating a mild drumbeat effect rather than varied rhythm. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, and there are few true artifacts; tightening metaphors and pruning repetitive abstractions would elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft shows strong rhythm and image-making, and most sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere, interiority, and action). However, the density of figurative and adjectival language is high nearly everywhere, leading to purple patches and small redundancies (“the vested hush fully vested itself,” multiple near-synonymous descriptions of mist and dewdrops). This ornamental excess slows momentum in what should be the narrative’s most pressurized beats. Clarity remains intact, but a more ruthless compression and fresher metaphors would be required for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level writing is generally fluent, with strong images (“branches twisted like ancient fingers,” “moonstone cabochon dust speck”) and a confident lyrical mode. Yet modifiers and invented phrases pile up so densely that some sentences blur, and key motifs (“mossy delight,” “transformed always”) edge toward repetitious rather than incantatory. There’s occasional paraphrase-like reiteration of the same ideas (monuments, transformation, renewal) without added pressure. The prose is strong and readable but could benefit from more variation in texture and a few strategic cuts for impact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and imagistic, often doing multiple jobs—advancing action while maintaining atmosphere and theme. There are some slightly overwrought or repetitive turns (“embodied uncertainty certainly,” “uncertainly certain they would hold”) and frequent figurative language that edges toward purple but stays legible. Sentences flow clearly with minimal scaffold or redundancy; grammar and sequencing are clean. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publishable, though trimming a few self-conscious flourishes would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft shows strong rhythmic control and dense, multi-function sentences that usually carry atmosphere, world-building, and emotion simultaneously. Some metaphoric stacks (“mirrors of luminous regret,” “factually mystical silver,” “kintsugi intentions”) verge on overwrought and occasionally feel like concept-labeling rather than lived perception. Nonetheless, clarity is rarely compromised, scaffolding is minimal, and there is little outright redundancy. The final third sustains momentum and image precision without succumbing to muddle, even if a lighter touch on repeated key phrases would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and action (“warped chord erupted, echoing Harlan’s broken mirth”). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and purposeful, though phrases like “luminous ache” and “like giggles choked by thorns” push toward purple when repeated. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and momentum generally holds despite the lyricism. Slight trimming of metaphor stacks and repeated emotional terms would raise clarity and impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is imaginative and information-dense, often doing multiple jobs at once, and many images (“bones leveraging against gravity like variables seeking equilibrium”) are striking. Yet figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, leading to moments of purple overload and minor redundancy (frequent reiterations of UV, proprioception, and mathematical metaphors). This density sometimes blurs rather than sharpens key beats, especially near the climax where clarity of action and realization could benefit from cleaner lines. Trimming a third of the metaphors would likely heighten impact without losing the lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid imagery and syntactic variety, and most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and plot). There is some purple-prose drift—dense figurative language in many lines and repeated constructions like “eternal instant”—that slightly blurs urgency. A few concepts are rephrased with near-synonymous flourish instead of progressing pressure, which softens momentum. Still, clarity remains high, and the final image reads cleanly despite the ornate style.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences have varied rhythms, and most carry multiple loads (atmosphere, character, and story) without bogging down. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme (wire, clocks, cracks, circus artifice), with only occasional excess (“weightless burden that clung without weighing him down” reads slightly tautological). There’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and action ordering is clear. The density of figurative language in places nudges toward ornament, but does not seriously impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and mood (“tomes like fruit,” “bottled tempest, rustling like a gale through dry leaves”). At times, figurative density verges on purple and the final paragraph stack of near-synonymous declarative lines (“Eternity, moment-bound. / The end.”) becomes redundant rather than intensifying. There are no major clarity or grammar issues, and momentum generally carries through despite occasional overrichness. Some trimming of repeated concepts would sharpen the already-strong images.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, syntactically clean, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character at once). The figurative density is high—“burnished corridors,” “grief gilded by possibility,” “emerald whirlpools”—and risks purple prose but remains internally consistent in its metallic/baroque lexicon. Momentum is maintained despite lyricism; the heist beats and storm sequence are not buried under exposition. The main craft limitation for elite markets is that ornament occasionally slightly blurs immediacy and sharpness of action.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is lush and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. However, metaphor density is very high (“vengful bloom,” “imprisoned starlight,” “tinkersong tears”), edging into purple and occasionally slowing momentum. There are mild paraphrase effects and a sense that a few images reiterate the same emotional beat rather than sharpening it. Clarity remains intact throughout, but tighter selection of figurative language would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is clean and grammatical, with some strong images (“limestone walls wept mineral tears,” “lantern’s glow dancing on jagged formations like frozen waves”). Nonetheless, key phrases and constructions loop frequently (“resonant hush,” “sensibly eccentric,” “hinged awakenings”), creating a sense of lexical churn rather than deliberate incantation. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase each other’s effects (e.g., multiple iterations of explanations failing and awakenings hinging) without adding new pressure or specificity. The prose is solid but somewhat overwritten and repetitive for elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level work is lush and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus theme). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and several motifs and phrases repeat (“perpetually learning,” “turbine-hum reverie,” “timewoven alliances,” “scaffold”) in ways that feel like conceptual loops rather than fresh turns. Occasionally, abstraction (“complexity knelt to her simple blade”) blurs rather than sharpens the image. Despite this purple-leaning density, overall clarity survives, but a top-market editor would want tightening and more discrimination in where figurative weight falls.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory density and mostly clean grammar and syntax. Many lines do double duty, carrying both atmosphere and interior state. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and certain phrases and motifs (“amber,” “umbral tenderness,” “dawning hush”) recur enough to feel slightly self-conscious and over-saturated. This high density of ornament blunts momentum and undercuts the sharpness of a few key moments, particularly around the climax and coda.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, often doing triple duty with atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotional charge in a single line. There are a few instances of purple or stacked metaphor (“sands parted like reluctant flesh,” frequent “searing”/“obsidian”/“tension” intensifiers) that verge on excess but don’t obscure basic sense. Sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Slight tightening of modifiers and a more selective metaphor palette in peak beats would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, dense with imagery, and grammatically clean; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. There are moments of purple or redundant emphasis—explaining working memory metaphorically and then functionally, or stacking inventive but similar images of revival—that slightly slow momentum. Still, syntax varies, clarity is preserved even in the more ornate lines, and the final images land cleanly. Trimming a few explanatory or over-decorated clauses would sharpen an already solid line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the writing is controlled, largely precise, and sensorially rich, with sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without major confusion. The rhythm is generally propulsive enough for a lyric piece, and key images (dissolving wax, bubbling voices) are clear. However, there is mild over-ornamentation and a small redundancy (“dissolving like dissolving oaths”) that slightly blunts impact and suggests a need for tighter pruning. These are refinements rather than structural issues, but they keep it just shy of elite-line crispness.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatical, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Imagery is striking and original in many places (“honeyed fog,” “roots drank starlight”), and there’s little true redundancy or scaffolding. The main weakness is a tendency toward stacked modifiers and abstract phrasing (“furious tranquility,” “serene fury,” “entropy yielded”) that occasionally verge on purple and slightly blur the physical picture. These excesses don’t obscure causality or the final image, but they do sap some sharpness and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level writing is clear, grammatically clean, and often sonorous; images like “stars piercing the velvet dark like frozen notes” show care with language. However, there is frequent reuse of the same loaded terms and constructions, creating a mild sense of synonym loops and motif over-insistence rather than deepening. Figurative density is moderate but sometimes leans purple, and the summarizing epilogue stacks abstractions (“balance was restored—listening over noise, forever”) instead of concrete images. Momentum remains intact, but trimming repetition would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains many strong, imagistic lines (“trails of stardust that shimmered like forgotten memories”; “radiant filigree”) and maintains momentum despite being reflection-heavy. At the same time, figurative language is dense and often stacked, with frequent use of similar terms (“hush,” “stillness,” “vulnerability,” “fragility”) that create paraphrase loops and occasional purple overtones. Several sentences restate thematic points in slightly different words without adding new information, softening impact. Line-level tightening and pruning of redundant metaphors would significantly elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong—dense, imagistic, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning. There is some tendency toward purple richness and conceptual repetition (“the weight of unspoken words,” “mute eloquence,” covenant restated in similar terms), which slightly blunts momentum. Still, syntax is clear, errors are absent, and the closing images land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.7)
    The line-level work is generally strong, dense, and purposeful; many sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent, and the piece avoids major mixed-metaphor tangles. There are a few abstractions and slightly purple turns (“tactile pulse,” “anticipatory voids,” “feel time’s texture through grief’s slow abrasion”) that skim toward overstatement but don’t derail clarity or momentum. Minor compression or trimming could heighten impact, yet the prose already approaches publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, rhythmically aware, and imagistically strong, with many sentences doing multiple jobs. That said, modifiers and figurative language accumulate heavily, edging into purple and causing some conceptual redundancy (e.g., repeated invocations of hush, cobalt, and woven dawns). Occasional summarizing theme-statements could be trimmed to preserve momentum. Craft is clearly above-average but could be tightened for maximal impact in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, information-dense, and often do double duty (world-building plus character plus theme). There is some repetition of key phrases and a mild tendency toward purple or slogan-like lines (“pollen and promise,” “remodeled testament to gently systematic daring”), but it doesn’t obscure sense or drag momentum. The prose maintains forward motion across summary transitions without obvious scaffold or synonym churn. A slightly leaner pass removing a few near-duplicate sentiments would elevate it to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is vivid and often striking, with strong information density (each line tends to do multiple jobs of mood, worldbuilding, and concept). However, the high frequency of figurative language and repeated motifs (“bronze quiet,” “luminous skepticism,” homecoming chemistry) occasionally edges into purple and risks blurring emphasis. Some sentences slightly paraphrase prior content rather than adding pressure, which slows momentum in a relatively low-conflict piece. Rhythm and clarity largely hold, but a modest trim would sharpen impact to elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Many lines carry striking images (“a desperate finger tracing infinity,” “husks rattling like ancestral dice”) that feel deliberate rather than random. However, figurative density is very high—nearly every paragraph carries multiple metaphors—which occasionally borders on purple and risks dulling impact through saturation. There are minor echoing constructions (“narrow vastness,” stacked modifiers) but no serious loop or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and the rhythm generally supports the contemplative pressure. However, there is clear purple-prose creep: stacked modifiers and repeated phrases (“wild hush,” “tinted,” “intuitively descriptive”) sometimes feel like motif by sheer reiteration rather than fresh insight. A few paraphrase-adjacent moments restate similar emotional content in consecutive lines, slightly dragging momentum. Still, clarity holds, and the final cadence lands with a coherent, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose often carries strong images and rhythm, especially in the early description of the deck and starfield, and the sentences generally read cleanly at the grammatical level. Yet the line-level work is weighed down by repetition, synonymic recycling (“echoed silence,” “true north,” “temporal stretch”), and a long run of short, declarative sentences at the end that feel like scaffolding rather than necessity. Several abstract or pseudo-profound phrases (“word count pulsed to finality,” “Temporal echoes faded into boundless night”) add purple flourish without adding new information or pressure. Information density is respectable, but trimming loops and flattening the more self-conscious metaphors would significantly tighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is competent to strong: clear syntax, few if any mechanical errors, and high information density with vivid images. However, figurative language is very frequent (“frozen fang,” “vault bruised purple,” “void-secrets,” “brittle veins”) and sometimes stacks, flirting with over-ornamentation in a short piece. A few abstractions and repeated labels reduce sharpness where concrete embodiment would deepen impact. Momentum survives, but trimming a layer of lyrical excess and slogan-like phrasing would sharpen the prose to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: lines are dense with information and image, and most sentences do more than one job (worldbuild, theme, and action simultaneously). The piece flirts with purple prose and repetition—“benevolently ruthless,” “luminous absence,” and “nomadic penumbra” recur often—but these are mostly functional motifs rather than empty ornament. Rhythm varies, with longer baroque sentences offset by sharper beats (“Now the action: ‘unbind’…”). While the metaphor density could be trimmed for even greater clarity and punch, it doesn’t materially obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. Metaphor chains (mercury-glass, thunder, roots, veins) are coherent and sustained rather than mixed, though they approach saturation and border on purple in a few lines. There are no obvious scaffold sentences, loops, or mechanical cadences that drag momentum or obscure causality. Slight tightening—trimming a few redundant modifiers and abstractions—would push the prose into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line by line, the prose is generally strong, with precise images (“pocketed as a talisman of forgiven folly”) and multi-function sentences that advance plot, mood, and theme. However, there is periodic purple stacking (“profound woven hush,” “fierce repose,” repeated emphasis on the hush intensifying) that risks saturation without always adding new pressure. Some near-duplication (multiple mentions of productive fidgeting and hush tightening) could be trimmed for sharper momentum. Grammar and clarity are clean, and closure isn’t dulled by artifacts, but a leaner pass would lift this toward elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is vivid and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. At times it flirts with purple—stacked metaphors and repeated motifs (“innocently mischievous,” “refract,” “forged hush”) risk feeling heavy-handed, though they don’t seriously obscure meaning. Rhythm and syntax have good variety and generally propel the scene forward rather than looping. Some pruning of redundant intensifiers and slightly mixed metaphors would sharpen an already strong line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often striking, with high information density and images that do more than one job (e.g., quilts as both village shrouds and memory-integration). However, metaphor and motif density is very high—“kintsugi,” “quilting,” “dire enchantment,” “oblivion” recur so frequently that they start to feel like scaffolding rather than fresh turns. There are minor paraphrase loops (“memories quilted anew” / “Memories quilted seamless”) that soften momentum in the midsection. Line-level craft is strong but over-ornamented for elite-publication standards, slightly dulling the impact of key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in length, are syntactically clean, and carry multiple functions (mood, characterization, and motion) at once. The prose sustains momentum despite being description-heavy, and key actions (taking the wrong turn, lifting the shell, leaving it) are rendered clearly. That said, figurative density is high, with many similes and elevated adjectives in close succession, which occasionally risks purple prose and could be pared to sharpen impact. There are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts, and closure lines land clearly despite the ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and most lines carry more than one job (advancing image, mood, and theme simultaneously). Sensory metaphors (especially scent and light) are well-chosen and coherent, and there is little scaffolding or filler. That said, there is a noticeable density of modifiers and repeated conceptual phrases (“screaming tenderness,” “vibrations of intent,” “purified”) that occasionally feel like a stylistic loop rather than fresh development. The prose is polished and publishable but could benefit from a slight tightening to avoid over-lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient: most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors (“geography of loss,” “loss’s atlas,” “concrete hives”) are coherent and thematically layered, not mixed or overwrought. Rhythm is well-managed across paragraphs, and the closing cadence (“He’d navigate on, piecing worlds from loss’s threads”) cleanly recharges earlier motifs. There is mild risk of saturation—so many figurative turns in one piece—that a few breaths of plainer language could sharpen contrast even more.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often striking—“clung like defiant prayers,” “storm-trapped moon,” “fractured grace”—and maintains strong information density with few wasted lines. Syntax is mostly varied and clear, and causality is never obscured by the lyricism. However, figurative and abstract language is heavily layered across many sentences, edging toward purple and creating some sameness of texture; certain terms (“fractured grace,” “occlude,” “veritas”) recur with near-mantric frequency. The density doesn’t quite stall momentum, but a bit more plainness at peak beats would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is rich and generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character (“Its iridescent surface shimmered like frozen whispers under his boots”). The repetition of “softly persistent” and some metaphor stacking (“sea exhaled its last gleam,” “twilight’s bruise-purple sky”) flirt with purple prose but do not significantly obscure sense or causality. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; almost every line contributes either to image, theme, or forward motion. Trimming a few redundant modifiers and allowing one or two beats to breathe with plainer diction would likely elevate this to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is vivid and largely clean, with strong sensory density and effective syntactic variety; images like “blooming archway of luminous ferns and orchids” read striking and coherent. Most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding, and there are no major grammatical or clarity errors. That said, figurative and descriptive language is occasionally over-stacked—repetitions of “blooming,” “glimmer,” and lush modifiers—creating a slight purple sheen and softening impact at peak beats. Some thematic phrasing in the final paragraphs (“testament to paths untaken,” “maps now shared stories”) slides toward abstraction instead of letting concrete images close the story.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and information-dense, and most metaphors are coherent and tonally aligned. There is some purple-leaning repetition of similar textures (“lacy menace,” “thorns beneath silk,” “gown trailing like spilled mercury,” “noose of glowing threads”), which risks saturation but doesn’t obscure meaning. Momentum stays intact despite the ornate style; each sentence usually advances either mood or situation. Tightening a few redundant figurative flourishes would raise the piece to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lines are polished and often beautiful at the sentence level, with strong imagery and some genuinely original turns of phrase. Yet figurative language is stacked densely in nearly every sentence, producing purple overload and occasional conceptual redundancy (e.g., repeated invocations of “density of presence,” “ember nexus,” and similar abstractions). This saturation flattens momentum and emotional contour, as nearly every beat is written at the same high pitch. Tighter control—selecting a few key metaphors to carry escalation—would be required for immediate elite-tier publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character (“its papery skin unfurling like a reluctant confession”). Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and meaning remains clear despite the density of figurative language. However, metaphor is stacked very heavily—almost every line carries a flourish—which occasionally feels ornamental and dilutes impact (“crags like broken teeth in the moon's indifferent grin” plus “arrow of light” plus “starlit shards” in quick succession). A touch more restraint and contrast between plain and heightened lines would sharpen the strongest moments.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains many striking images and layered metaphors, and at its best it achieves high information density (e.g., the screw “no bigger than a tear” that bridges object and emotion). Yet there is noticeable purple drift and some paraphrase/redundancy (“scratches like frantic scratches”) and stacked figurative language that occasionally blurs rather than sharpens. Most damaging are the closing meta lines about trimming to fit a word count and “system counts,” which are clear text artifacts that puncture immersion and weaken the final image’s charge. Line-level craft is promising but needs tightening and artifact removal to reach elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, largely free of redundancy or mechanical error, and often does double-duty for mood and character (“steam that curled like forgotten sigils,” “fireflies reversing flight”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and sensorial, with a consistent metaphorical lexicon of storms, breath, and light. There is some repetition around crystals shedding and holographic vignettes that feels more like re-articulation than escalation, edging toward mild overwriting. Still, momentum holds through to a clear, charged closing image without significant scaffold or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences do at least two jobs in advancing atmosphere, character, and conflict. Rhythm varies well, and key beats (“Theo materialized, not as whole man but fragmented…”) land with clarity and punch. However, the prose occasionally edges into excess, with stacked metaphors and repeated grit/orchard imagery that risk slight saturation and could fatigue some readers in a high-pressure market. Trimming a few decorative flourishes would heighten impact without altering meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-rich (“dust motes danced in shafts of ethereal light, filtering through cracks in eternity’s stone”), and line-level clarity is generally maintained. That said, figurative language is dense and sometimes redundant (“resounding hush,” “wanderingly exact,” and spiral metaphors recur with minimal new information), bordering on purple in places. Some sentences paraphrase the same idea in adjacent lines, slightly dulling momentum. Still, syntax is clean, and the closure image is not obscured by the ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally lucid and musical, with concrete verbs and evocative metaphors (brass veins, horizons bending like scimitars, water holding its breath). Information density is high; lines often do double duty for atmosphere and concept. There is some repetition and mild paraphrase looping around “razor edges,” “fjord quiet,” and the key’s peculiarity, which edges toward purple and slightly slows momentum in places. Still, syntax is varied, clarity is never seriously compromised, and the closing cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and striking images like “spores drifting like silent embers” and “eyes like faded constellations.” Sentences vary in rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops, despite a few recurring phrases such as “quiet wildfire” and “letting go.” Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme rather than muddled. A demanding editor might trim a few near-redundant thematic sentences to sharpen momentum and avoid slight purple overtones.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“pages yellowed like old regrets,” “dust motes dancing in her candle’s beam”) and good information density—most sentences do double duty for mood and character. There is some repetition of key terms and a touch of purple density, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum. Expository statements near the end (“He had gambled compulsively, yes, but to test theories rebelliously...”) read more like summary than scene and slightly flatten the climax. Still, grammar, rhythm, and sequencing are clean, and the closing image resolves motifs with satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, selective detail, and sentences that usually do more than one job (world-building, mood, and theme at once). Repetition of motifs like “hum,” “loop,” and “melodically haunted” reads largely as deliberate patterning rather than accidental looping. A few phrases edge toward purple or redundant (“melodically haunted—ethereal wails twisting into sighs”), but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or slow momentum. Line-level economy is solid; trims could make it even sharper, but there are no serious artifacts compromising the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and often carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and action). Imagery is striking and mostly coherent, though the density of modifiers and metaphors occasionally verges on purple and risks numbing impact through repetition. Some phrasing loops (“gently thorough,” “haunted euphoria,” “small moments”) feel like thematic scaffolding stated twice rather than freshly developed. Despite this, momentum holds and the closure image (jetty dimming, locket warm, sea’s sigh) remains sharp and undulled by figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and sentences that often perform multiple functions (world-building, theme, and motion). Metaphors like rumor “slithering through the ivy” or the rock as “borrowed starlight” are apt and controlled. There is some repetition of terms and constructions (rumor chains, catalyzing, reciprocity) and mild purple lean, giving a slight sense of rhetorical layering rather than escalation. Still, clarity and momentum are never obscured, and the final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with few wasted phrases. Many lines do double duty, advancing both setting and interior stakes (e.g., the ring’s physical sensations mapping onto emotional urgency). The main issue is occasional overwriting—stacked metaphors and intensifiers in close proximity (“threads of forgotten dreams,” “quiet blaze,” “silent symphonies”) that risk blurring impact through abundance. Despite this, momentum and clarity survive, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level work is polished, with many sentences doing double duty for image and concept, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. There is some density of figurative language—gravitational metaphors, threshing, bends, strange comfort—that occasionally borders on purple and risks redundancy (“confidently uncertain” and “unbending” recur a bit on-the-nose). Still, clarity is rarely compromised, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or loop artifacts. Trimming a handful of metaphors and tightening repeated motifs would likely elevate it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clear and musical, with strong images and a good sense of cadence, especially in the opening and the festival disruption. However, metaphor density is high and occasionally repetitive (“quiet charisma,” “joyful sorrow,” multiple silence-as-music formulations), edging into purple and softening impact. A few sentences restate similar ideas—silence holding rhythms, pauses pregnant with memory—without adding much new pressure or texture. Tightening these redundancies and pruning a few metaphors would sharpen momentum and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence-level clarity is good and the narrative moves forward without confusion, but the prose leans into stacked metaphors and repeated motifs in ways that occasionally feel purple (“volcanic tenderness,” “erupting,” “lava” recur with limited modulation). Many lines do double duty (emotion + worldbuilding or theme), yet some could be tightened without loss. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, but there are pockets where intensity is told rather than freshly embodied. Overall craft is above average, though line-level refinement would be required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and image-dense, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing action while sustaining motif (“Her drumming cascaded onto nearby blooms, each tap a Morse of defiance”). Repetition of key terms (auroral, hush, drumming) reads as intentional motif rather than accidental looping, and there are few to no genuine scaffolds or paraphrase redundancies. Some stretches flirt with purple prose and stacked modifiers, but metaphors stay internally coherent and do not derail clarity, including at the climax and closure. Overall momentum is maintained despite the lyricism, with only minor risk of saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and generally purposeful; most sentences carry more than one job (world, mood, and tactic at once) without obvious scaffolding. The rhythm varies nicely between compressed action in the race and slightly longer, image-rich lines in set-up and denouement. There is mild purple edging in a few phrases (“pocket-sized prophecies,” “legend echoed softly, eternally”), and theme-summary at the very end dulls the otherwise strong closure image a bit. Still, there are no real loops, muddled metaphors, or structural artifacts to obscure cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for mood and action (e.g., shutters snapping “like whispers in the night”). There is some tendency toward over-saturation of metaphor and repeated coined phrases (“stillwater tension,” “edge of the half-spoken secret,” “spiralingly calm”), which slightly dull impact over the span of the piece. Even so, clarity holds, progression is easy to follow, and there is little true scaffolding or synonym-churn. The final images read cleanly and without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and the narrative flows without syntactic confusion. However, metaphor and modifier density is high (“mist…veils of fog…forgotten regrets,” “shelves of sapphire-bound tomes…pages rustling like breaths”) to the point of mild purple prose, and key terms like “quiet,” “hush,” and “second thoughts” recur in similar formulations. There is little outright looping, but some images restate previous effects rather than advancing pressure. Tightening and pruning a few ornamental metaphors would sharpen impact significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, purposeful images, and generally high information density. Some phrases verge on purple or redundant (“combative tenderness,” “savage liberty,” layered modifiers), but they do not obscure meaning. There are no major loops or scaffolding sentences, and action order is clear, especially around the rope-cutting and departure. Tightening a few overt thematic phrases and trimming adjectives would elevate the prose to a more rarefied level.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“shavings curling like pale whispers”) and clean mechanics; sentences usually carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding. There is some tendency toward repetition in structure and metaphor (frequent invocations of void, hush, and lightness) and occasional purple-ish lines that restate an already-earned effect. Despite the density of figurative language, clarity remains high and the final image lands cleanly. Trimming a few redundant or over-explicit sentences would sharpen momentum to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence structures and dense, multi-purpose images that sustain momentum despite lyricism. Occasional repetition (“aesthetically driven,” reiterations of boundaries dissolving) creates minor redundancy, and metaphor density is high enough that a few images blur rather than sharpen. However, clarity is largely preserved; cause and effect through the ritual remain understandable. The piece skirts purple without tipping into muddle, demonstrating solid line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich images (“molten heart of the central furnace,” “embers flickering in recognition”) and good information density. There is some purple-leaning stacking of modifiers and figurative language, especially early, that could be trimmed for even greater impact. Sentences vary in structure and maintain clarity; causality and action are never obscured by ornament. No significant scaffolding or repetition undermines the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is lush, imagistic, and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding (“pure tone fracturing into harmonious shards, golden shadows pulsing in sync”). There is occasional purple excess and repetition of similar metaphoric textures (threads, weave, texture, etc.), but coherence is maintained. Information density is high and scaffolding minimal; almost every line contributes to atmosphere or thematic build. The sustained figurative intensity might fatigue some readers in a longer piece, but at this length it remains more a stylistic choice than a structural flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-rich, achieving high information density where individual lines carry setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Still, there is evident repetition of favored terms and constructs (“withering,” “bloom,” “subdued ardor,” conceptual pairings like “despair to dawn”) that creates a mild purple-prose sheen. Some sentences do nearly the same atmospheric work without adding new pressure or specificity, slightly dragging momentum. Despite this, causality and closure remain clear and the final image is not obscured by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and theme. Metaphors are frequent but largely coherent, and only occasionally flirt with purple without collapsing into muddle. There is some repetition (“steadily curious,” “inherited mystery”) and a density of elevated imagery that could be pared back slightly to sharpen impact. Nonetheless, momentum remains intact, syntax is clear, and the closing cadence lands cleanly on a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and avoid obvious scaffolding or redundant loops, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and apt (“frozen scream of light,” “atoms of nostalgia”), with no major figurative muddles in the climax. There is some risk of purple prose via stacked modifiers and nearly every sentence bearing imagery, which slightly flattens dynamic range and can feel dense. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum survive, and the final paragraphs land crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with clear syntax, few if any mechanical errors, and sentences that often carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Recurring phrases and images (“softly deliberate,” “blooming,” “luminous”) occasionally edge into redundancy and create a slight sense of sameness in rhythm. Figurative language is lush but usually coherent; only a few spots feel like conceptual overlap rather than fresh turns. Momentum holds, though a small amount of trimming in the closing paragraphs would sharpen the impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is above average, with many strong images (“its iridescent scales catching starlight like forgotten jewels”) and generally clear, propulsive sentences. There is some repetition and mild purple-prose drift—recurring terms like “shimmering stillness,” “quietly vivid,” and multiple “she shed/peeling layers” iterations feel slightly overemphasized. Nonetheless, there are no serious clarity issues, and most sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere, character, and theme) efficiently. Tightening redundancies and paring a few abstract formulations would raise it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with dense, multi-function sentences and few outright redundancies; rhythm is varied and the final image is clear and charged. However, figurative language is very frequent—“meteor hush,” “cosmic dust,” “frost cracking like old skin,” “wounds birthed wisdom”—creating a mild purple sheen that occasionally blurs rather than sharpens sensation. Some conceptual repetition around scars/closure borders on paraphrase. These are refinement issues rather than structural flaws, but they do shave momentum and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, doing simultaneous work on atmosphere, character, and theme. However, it leans into purple territory at times, with stacked metaphors and repeated lexemes (“incubating,” “spatially imaginative,” “unused love”) that create a faint sense of synonym churn and over-insistence. Most sentences remain clear, and momentum generally holds, but a few lines feel like they’re circling the same idea rather than advancing it. Tightening figurative language and trimming redundancies would significantly sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is strong, with few if any outright awkward sentences, and many lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative density is high and somewhat repetitive—“shadowed rapture,” “unwritten calendar,” “stardust” and “auroral” variations recur enough to feel slightly overwrought. The prose occasionally prioritizes abstraction over concrete sensation, which softens impact and momentum. Trimming a handful of redundant metaphors and sharpening a few images into the body/senses would significantly elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty in image and theme, and the rhythm carries the reader forward. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically unified (fire/ash/bloom/quantum wave), with little genuine muddle. There is some redundancy in concepts like “sparks,” “unlit corners,” “hush,” but it feels pattern-driven rather than accidental looping. Overall, the prose is lush but controlled enough not to obscure the closure image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and imagistic, often doing dual work for world-building and theme (“probable miracles bloomed like rustflowers in the undergear”). The metaphor load is heavy but mostly coherent within the mechanical-organic palette, and there are few true loops or slack sentences. At an elite-publication standard, some phrases verge on purple or repetitive abstraction (“wild frontier,” “probable miracles,” “untamed expanse”) and could benefit from occasional plainer, embodied beats to sharpen contrast. Nonetheless, rhythm, clarity, and information density remain strong, especially around the corewheel climax.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally smooth and grammatical, with a few striking images and a coherent sonic texture. It leans heavily on figurative language and repeated motifs (leash, lullaby, indirect routes, “gently persistent”), which starts to feel like synonym and concept looping rather than fresh development. Several adjacent lines paraphrase similar ideas (e.g., courage as unused, lingering, buried) without adding new pressure or specificity. This density flirts with purple and slightly dulls momentum, though the closure image itself remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are purposeful, often doing double duty for mood and information, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Imagery is dense but usually coherent, and motifs (frost, cobalt, choir, nerves) recur in a patterned way rather than as noise. A few phrases and metaphors push toward overwrought (“seraphically mundane activity,” “frostbitten hope”), risking saturation without always adding new nuance. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained through the climax and into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is often lush and memorable, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“iron gall ink pellet, its tannic heart dark as forgotten oaths”). Information flows clearly, and there are few if any genuine artifacts or logical muddles. However, modifiers and metaphors are layered so heavily that some sentences feel over-designed, and a few images repeat similar effects (graceful, silken, elegant collapse) without adding new pressure. Tightening 10–15% of the adornment, especially in the already-charged climax, would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally tight, with strong verbs, concrete nouns, and multi-tasking lines that advance setting, character, and theme together (“Healthy corals steered currents like invisible highways; their loss had erased old paths unpredictably”). Rhythm varies well between longer, flowing descriptive sentences and shorter, punchier beats around revelation. A few phrases verge on abstraction or mild purple (“periodically eternal,” “personal liturgy against isolation”), but they’re consistent with the chosen lyric mode and don’t obscure sense or closure. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and information density is high without feeling cramped.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is above average: sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, and plot), and syntax varies with some effective cadence. At the same time, there is notable overwriting: dense metaphor stacking (“bruised skies bled into velvet night,” “thunderous serenity,” “fury’s prelude”) and repeated formulations that don’t always add new pressure. A few near-paraphrases of the central motifs create mild redundancy and dilute peak beats. These artifacts don’t break clarity, but they do sap momentum and keep the prose from a truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally fluent and vivid, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“mineral-rich waters feeding lush ferns and resilient vines that clung to obsidian rocks”). There is some density of modifiers and conceptual phrasing that edges toward purple, and occasional redundancy in reasserting the same ideas (rebellion, reconstruction, evolving tradition). Rhythm and clarity hold up, especially through the climax, and there are no major artifacts or confusions. Tightening figurative language and cutting a few abstract summaries would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, rhythm varies, and most images (“glass enclosures a fragile Eden,” the drone’s buzz in the wind) are clean and evocative. Information density is high with minimal scaffolding or redundant paraphrase. There is some drift into abstract or slightly purple phrasing (“pearl of stillness gleamed eternal,” “anchored optimism in realism”) that feels more like essayistic overlay than lived perception. These moments don’t derail clarity but do modestly dull the otherwise excellent cadence and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, grammatically clean, and often striking (“cards like shards of a shattered mirror,” “glowing dust motes that danced like mournful fireflies”). Many sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, theme) and the overall momentum remains intelligible. However, figurative language is heavy in nearly every line, with repeated motifs (“necessary darkness,” “walls closing in,” luminescence) creating a purple, almost saturated effect. This density, plus some near-redundant phrasings, slightly dulls rather than sharpens peak beats, keeping the piece below elite line-craft standards.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains many striking images and generally strong rhythm, with good information density per sentence. Yet modifiers and metaphors are heavily stacked (“sinuous, bone-like forms that whispered of endurance,” “swirling mandalas of azure fractals”), edging toward purple and occasionally blurring immediacy. There is some conceptual redundancy around “serene anger,” “consciously wild,” and restating the same emotional state. Despite this, clarity largely survives and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, vivid, and syntactically sound, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and action. There is a tendency toward density—stacked modifiers, repeated abstract terms (contraband, scandal, networks)—that verges on purple but doesn’t quite tip into muddle. A few paraphrase-adjacent loops (“scandalize the silence,” “scandalizing the world”) and similar constructions could be trimmed for tautness. Despite that, clarity and momentum survive, and the closing lines land with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images and a confident rhythm, and it carries a lot of thematic work at the line level. There is noticeable repetition and some purple phrasing (“inculcating the plants with values,” “engraved quiet aligning with her core”) that feels redundant or slightly abstract. Figurative language is dense but usually coherent; it does not seriously obscure action or causality. Trimming a few echoing phrases and abstractions would sharpen momentum without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is polished and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“vibrating petals unfurled like translucent scrolls transliterating emotions…”). Information density is high and generally propulsive; there are few if any true scaffolding or filler sentences. However, metaphor and heightened diction are applied almost continuously, creating occasional purple-prose pressure and small redundancies (repeated “feral lullaby,” “patterns break themselves”) that slightly blunt peak impact. Clarity never collapses, but a touch more spareness around the climax would let the strongest images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, generally clear, and information-dense, with several lines doing double duty for mood and theme (e.g., “orbits of regret tightened with each journalist's probe”). There is some purple layering—repeated “orbits,” frequent personification of the dome, clouds, and stars—that risks over-saturation but doesn’t yet obscure meaning. A few phrases paraphrase each other conceptually and the figurative load can flatten impact by sheer density. Still, action order and emotional beats remain legible, and the final image lands cleanly despite occasional excess.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally precise, and dense with imagery that usually pulls double duty for mood and theme. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances atmosphere or stakes. That said, the prose occasionally flirts with purple—metaphor stacked on metaphor—so emotional impact sometimes blurs under texture (“guilt’s orchestra, clashing notes of what-ifs and failures”). Trimming a few of the more crowded figurative phrases would sharpen already compelling language.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) and the rhythm alternates between lush description and cleaner beats at turning points. There is some repetition of key adjectives and concepts (lilac, hush, unease) and occasional modifier stacking that leans toward purple but doesn’t seriously impede clarity. Information flows logically, and there are few if any scaffold or paraphrase loops that stall momentum. A slightly leaner weave—especially in the mid-story descriptive density—would heighten tension without sacrificing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often striking, with high information density and images like “crimson fissures wept cold light like frozen blood” that effectively carry mood and world-building simultaneously. However, figurative language is nearly continuous and sometimes stacks (“warm coldness—affectionate hatred, tender savagery”), pushing toward purple and occasionally blurring rather than sharpening emotional beats. There are a few conceptual redundancies and near-restatements, but they don’t seriously clog momentum or obscure causality. Overall, the line-level craft is strong but would benefit from a bit more restraint and variation to fully meet top-tier standards.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, often doing multiple jobs at once—advancing action, worldbuilding, and interiority through synesthetic metaphor. The repetition of certain terms (“echoes,” “nostalgia,” “timelines”) mostly reads as intentional patterning, though the sheer volume of figurative language occasionally edges toward purple and risks dulling impact. Line-by-line clarity remains intact, with clean syntax and few scaffolding sentences; momentum is more lyric than propulsive but not stalled. A touch more ruthlessness in trimming redundant modifiers and rephrases would sharpen an already strong line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, sensuous, and information-dense, with effective compression of backstory. Some metaphoric layering (“willowglass hope,” “fractal lights,” “hidden pathways”) borders on over-saturation and self-consciousness, but doesn’t seriously obscure meaning. There are minor redundancies in emphasizing the same motifs and emotional states, yet momentum through the central experiment is maintained. Tightening a few repeated formulations would sharpen impact and elevate the prose to a more rarefied level.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is generally fluent, with strong imagery (e.g., “fear's cold blues and curiosity's warm oranges”) and multifunctional sentences that carry worldbuilding and mood together. There is some redundancy and phrase-looping (“factually mystical” appears multiple times; “voice of the unknown” is asserted rather than re-embodied), and a tendency toward abstract modifiers over concrete micro-actions at peak beats. Figurative density is high but usually coherent, though occasional explanatory clauses blunt momentum. Overall the prose is above average but not yet razor-honed for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose offers striking images and generally strong sentence-level rhythm; many lines do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. However, there is some density-drift into purple territory and mild repetition (“as the truth began to unravel… As the truth unraveled further”), and figurative language is nearly continuous. These choices do not break clarity, but they occasionally blunt momentum and emotional sharpness. Tightening a few metaphors and trimming redundancies would elevate this to top-tier line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often striking, with strong sensory images and efficient compression of backstory into present action, and many sentences pull double duty for mood and plot. Yet there is noticeable repetition of favored constructions ("silver hush," "prudently daring," mantra-like closures) and an accumulation of modifiers that occasionally tips toward purple. Some lines restate prior points without adding pressure, creating minor paraphrase loops. Overall, craft is above-average and publishable with tightening, but the line-level density would benefit from selective pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose has striking images (“palimpsest promise,” “fog-brewed tea”) and good rhythmic variation, and it mostly remains clear at the sentence level. However, there is a persistent tendency toward purple density and synonymic layering (“spindrift serenity,” “percolation complete, truth steeped”), which can feel redundant and slightly clog momentum. Several adjacent sentences restate similar ideas about serenity, fog, and distillation without adding new pressure or detail. For a top-tier venue, this would need tightening and some pruning of overlapping metaphors and abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“smoke flattened, pooling like ink on dusk,” “a gentle sharpness against the void”). Yet metaphor and abstraction are very dense, especially around “thrumming” and “phototropic kindness,” flirting with purple prose and occasional redundancy. Momentum holds, but a rigorous edit could cut a few near-duplicate images and slightly overdetermined lines. Clarity never collapses, but elite venues would expect a touch more spareness.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with rhythmic variation and many evocative images, and it sustains atmosphere effectively. Yet figurative language is very dense—“spilled mercury,” “unspoken storms,” “fear pooling like oil slicks,” “protected vulnerability incarnate”—creating a slight purple sheen and occasional sense of repetition (e.g., “luminous harbor,” “quivering hush”). Some sentences explicate the metaphor already dramatized, adding a touch of thematic scaffolding. None of this breaks clarity, but it does modestly drag momentum and undercuts the sharpest lines.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose offers strong images (tides of mist, shelves groaning under waves of knowledge) and generally clean syntax, with no serious clarity issues. That said, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts (“brittle awakenings,” “by the hum…,” “atomically reflective”) that sometimes feels like scaffold rather than deliberate refrain. Several lines slide toward purple or generic cosmic language (“whispers of infinity,” “continued unbound”) that dilutes the sharper images. Overall momentum holds, but trimming redundancy and sharpening metaphors would raise it to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is polished and clear, with nearly every sentence carrying some combination of image, mood, or narrative advancement. There is a tendency toward purple prose and motif repetition (“inevitably whimsical,” “prismatic,” recurring lotus/spiral descriptors) that occasionally feels ornamental rather than pressure-bearing. Still, syntax is controlled, there are no major clarity lapses, and the closing images land cleanly without figurative muddle. The piece could improve by trimming a few redundant modifiers and thematic restatements to heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is vivid and information-dense, with many lines doing double-duty for atmosphere and character (“coffee stains on star maps, the metallic tang of solder…”). However, there's a tendency toward metaphor stacking and near-repetition of concepts (“ethereal grit,” “cautiously hopeful,” multiple similes for the tower and power plays) that edges into mild overwriting. Momentum largely survives, but trimming a few redundant images would sharpen the impact of the strongest ones. Syntax and grammar are clean, and causality remains clear at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose often carries multiple functions—atmosphere, emotion, and worldbuilding—within single sentences, and many images (spatial mutiny, prismatic starlight, organ pipes as sentinels) are striking. Yet there is a persistent tendency toward purple density and paraphrase-looping, especially in the final third (“vital key lost to time,” “time’s thievery,” “starlit glory,” “endless exploration”) that repeat concepts without adding pressure. Figurative language appears in a high proportion of lines, sometimes feeling ornamental rather than earned by the moment’s urgency. This ornamental excess blunts momentum and makes the ending feel more like a thematic recap than a sharply cut final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied in rhythm, and often carry more than one function (atmosphere plus theme or character). However, figurative language is very dense and sometimes redundant or purple (“pain flowered, empathy uncoiling like mist burned by dawn”; repeated “furrowed hush”), which can blunt impact. Several end-of-paragraph sententiae restate ideas we already grasp, slightly dragging momentum. Despite this, causality and closure remain clear, and the prose rarely obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is vivid and information-dense, with several strong images (“walls wept condensation,” “pages furred with salt,” “absorbing resolve like a vast, insidious sponge”) doing multiple jobs at once. However, metaphor density is high, and the “spongey dread” motif is leaned on so often that it verges on self-consciousness and slight redundancy. Despite this purple tendency, clarity of action and stakes is rarely obscured, and sentence rhythm has variation and propulsion. A touch of pruning—especially of repeated modifiers and near-synonymous intensifiers—would likely lift this to publishable polish.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is imagistic and often striking, and many sentences multitask by carrying setting, theme, and mood at once. However, figurative language is extremely dense, with recurring key terms (“luminous disbelief,” “pixelated amnesty,” “dynamically observant”) and stacked metaphors that approach purple and occasionally feel redundant. This ornamental excess slightly slows momentum and risks blurring rather than sharpening certain beats, especially near the end. Line-level clarity is never lost, but the story would benefit from selective pruning and more concrete, embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often striking and economical, with many lines doing double duty for setting, theme, and character (“faded stripes whispering of laughter long silenced”). There is some repetitiveness and purple tint—key phrases like “perceptively calm,” “dusky,” and “harmony” recur enough to feel like scaffolding rather than entirely organic rhythm. Several beats (startup rise/fall, media dubbing) tilt toward summary-exposition instead of equally textured scene work. Still, syntax is clean, momentum generally holds, and figurative language rarely muddies clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences are mostly clear and grammatical, with a fluent rhythmic variety, and the piece avoids outright confusion or syntactic mishaps. However, it often over-relies on similar abstract words—“solace,” “burden,” “witness,” “healed”—and stacked modifiers, creating a mild purple haze. Several lines paraphrase or echo earlier sentiments (“Midnight solace…dawn’s promise,” “their story, chronicled in starlight”) without adding new pressure or detail. The line-level craft is competent and occasionally striking, but not as ruthlessly precise or economical as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong and clear, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and action. However, there is noticeable stacking of metaphors and modifiers (“swirling orchard vortex,” “serene inevitability,” “calm ferocity,” etc.) that risks purple prose and a somewhat clogged rhythm. Some motifs and phrases repeat without always adding new pressure, creating mild redundancy. Despite this, causality and imagery remain legible, and the closure image is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid figurative language, clear syntax, and mostly efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and information. However, it leans toward density and over-saturation of metaphor and modifiers, particularly in high-pressure beats, which risks purple prose and occasional redundancy (“dreams intersected in explosive beauty” after already-rich description). Some motifs are reiterated without adding new nuance, creating mild loopiness rather than progression. Line-level craft is solid and publishable with tightening, but not yet razor-lean at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, with strong verbs and vivid, concrete images (“phosphorescent fungi cast shadows that danced like forgotten prayers”). Most sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character intent, and action order is clear. However, figurative density is high throughout, and some abstractions (“holes in her soul,” “idealist heart mended”) feel comparatively generic against the otherwise specific imagery. There is mild purple-prose drift and some phrase repetition, but no serious loops or muddled metaphors that obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with effective sensory anchors and professional detail doing double duty. There is some scaffold and repetition—phrases like “wrested,” “after the applause,” “confidently uncertain,” and explicit restatements of purpose recur in ways that feel a bit didactic rather than intensifying. A few lines drift toward purple or generic inspirational phrasing, especially near the end, which slightly dulls the closure image. Still, sentence-level clarity and momentum hold throughout without serious artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, dense, and musical, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is nearly constant, and motifs (“haunted ambitions,” “reestablish,” “touching distance,” “flux”) recur so frequently that some phrases start to feel like conceptual scaffolding rather than fresh image. A few sentences lean into abstract jargon at the expense of sensory immediacy, softening momentum. Clarity remains good, but a bit more spareness around peak beats would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense yet mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and story (“tides receded, revealing submerged scrolls that whispered of phases yet to come” both closes and foreshadows). Rhythm varies well and avoids obvious template cadences or paraphrase loops, and metaphors are generally coherent with the world’s logic. There is a high frequency of figurative language, but it reads intentional rather than purple, and clarity remains intact through the climax. A touch more sparseness at the ritual’s peak might heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains many strong, evocative lines and effective sonic choices (“crystals quivered, their facets softening like frost under dawn”), and most sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere, world-building, and character). However, figurative density is high throughout, with frequent abstractions (“latent radiance,” “resonant hush,” “eternal heartbeat”) and some near-repetitive constructions that risk purple overload. A few phrases effectively restate the same idea in different terms, especially around the “heartbeat of hesitation” and final unity, which slightly dulls impact. Tightening modifiers and trimming conceptually redundant lines would markedly sharpen momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often rich and effective, with multiple lines doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (e.g., vines as accusations, tape as a metaphor for mending). There is strong information density and mostly clean syntax. At the same time, figurative language is frequent and occasionally tips into purple or redundancy, and motif words (“methodical,” “raw solace,” “alluded,” “wisdom”) recur in ways that feel more like scaffolding than deliberate pattern. The final third leans on explanatory abstraction, softening momentum and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) and read clearly despite density. There is some repetition of constructions and motifs (“cautious exuberance,” “propagation delays”) and a tendency toward stacked modifiers that occasionally feel ornamental rather than necessary. However, there are no major loops, mixed metaphors, or syntactic confusions that derail momentum or blur causality. The prose is lush but not sloppy, just shy of the razor-honed precision expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often striking—“transparent as frozen tears,” “notes cascading like glacial avalanches”—and carries strong rhythm and sensory density. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, with recurrent motifs (“mulberry ache,” “perforations,” “velvet”) and stacked modifiers that edge into purple and could be pruned for even greater impact. Despite this, line-level clarity of action and causality is maintained; there are no major loops or scaffolding sentences that stall momentum. A slightly leaner metaphor load, especially in the climax, would elevate this to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is richly imagistic and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. There is some overwriting and echo (“radiant hush,” “hush within hush,” frequent “spark” and “threshold” invocations) that could be trimmed for sharpness. Figurative language is dense but usually coherent, and causality remains readable despite the lyricism. A slight reduction of metaphor stacking in high-pressure beats would improve momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“perpetual twilight wove shadows through ancient vines”). That said, figurative language and modifiers are dense across almost every line, creating occasional purple patches and a sense of over-insistence. A few concepts are reiterated in similar terms (cycle of rebirth, hush, kindness/decisiveness), which could be tightened for sharper momentum. Clarity remains intact, but trimming ornamentation would elevate the piece toward truly elite line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often beautiful at the image level (wind chimes as “oracle bones,” “unhooking” as visceral), and many sentences do double duty for mood and theme. Yet there is a noticeable density of abstractions and near-synonymous repetitions (“certainty,” “nuance,” “protected vulnerability”) that produce a mild sense of loop and purple-ness. Several lines and even the closing stretch paraphrase earlier insights rather than advancing them, slightly dulling momentum and the closure image. Tightening redundant phrases and trimming thesis-like sentences would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.5)
    The line-level work is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, leading to a sense of purple accumulation that occasionally muddies emphasis and slows momentum. The self-referential “Wait, word count way over” scaffolding is a clear artifact that damages the illusion and particularly touches the closure zone. Some trimming of redundant modifiers and meta-asides would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, generally balancing clarity with lyricism: phrases like “fossilized spines of titanic beasts” and “heartbeat adrift in time” are vivid and apt. Sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, and character) without frequent slack or scaffolding, and the final lines land cleanly. There is mild repetition in certain motifs/phrases (“weathered,” “layered dust,” accumulative adjectives) that edges toward purple in places but does not obscure sense or closure. Tightening a few stacked modifiers would elevate this to a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a good information density—many sentences do double duty on worldbuilding and emotion. However, metaphor and abstraction are laid on heavily (“winds howled like automated elegies,” “auroral gardens,” “ozone and ozone-tinged glory”), creating a near-constant high lyric register that can blur impact and feel overwrought. There are minor redundancy slips and phrase echoes that could be cut for tautness. Tightening figurative stacks and trimming a few adornments would give the key beats more air and force.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied sentence structures and dense but generally lucid imagery; most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or plot). Metaphor use is heavy yet mostly coherent and thematically aligned with light, sea, and sound, with no real loops or scaffolding artifacts. A few phrases flirt with purple (“jagged spine of the Leviathan,” “lanterns bobbed overhead like approving specters”), and the figurative density slightly blurs physical stakes. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved through to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatical, varied, and information-dense, and many images (“galaxies blooming in reverse fury”) are evocative. There is, however, a tendency toward stacked metaphors and repeated abstract formulations (“stellar doubt,” “wavelength align with purpose,” “distilled”) that create a mild sense of purple density and conceptual redundancy. The expository phrasing in places (“revealing the universe’s self-doubt as the catalyst for rebirth”) tells what the scene has already implied. Even so, momentum and clarity survive, and the final paragraphs land cleanly despite the figurative load.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level work is generally strong: clear syntax, high information density, and evocative metaphors that usually do more than one job. However, there is frequent figurative stacking and repetition (“echo,” “scattered light,” “resonance”) that edges into overwriting and could be pared without loss. A few lines paraphrase prior content (“the echo of sacrifice resolving into a soft resonance”) rather than adding new pressure. These tendencies slightly blunt momentum and keep the piece just short of elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“stars winking erratically like faulty lanterns,” “bronze fractured like a beggar's promise”) and good information density. Sentences vary in length and structure, and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). However, figurative language is almost continuous, and certain phrases and concepts are reiterated (lukewarm, naive, brittle devotion, dripping precision), edging into mild purple and redundancy. Pruning a few metaphors and tightening repeated thematic statements would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty by advancing plot and atmosphere in the same line. Vivid images like spires “piercing the surface like forgotten accusations” are effective, and sentence variety keeps momentum acceptable. However, the density of figurative language and repeated constructions (“mirrored hush,” “twilight draped,” “twilight bled into the ridgeway's midnight veil”) edges toward purple and occasionally feels redundant rather than additive. A few abstract formulations (“motivation fulfilled,” “meaning endured beyond the flood”) read like thematic scaffolding rather than lived perception, slightly dulling peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is polished and largely clear, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and few outright redundancies. However, figurative language and modifiers are so densely packed (“prismatic spray,” “forgotten jewels,” “ancient freshness,” “vortex of feathers and foresight”) that the prose at times veers into purple and risks numbing impact. Certain concepts and phrases are reiterated with slight variation rather than deepened, contributing mild synonym-loop feel. Despite this excess, causality and closure imagery remain legible and emotionally effective.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and often striking (“star-pricked void,” “mind a forge for deciphering chaos”), with good information density and clear sequencing of technical actions. Recurrent motifs (“soundless echo,” “watcher’s burden,” “patterns held”) give texture but sometimes veer into mild redundancy, particularly in the final third. There’s occasional purple tonality and stacked abstraction, yet clarity of action never collapses. Tightening a few paraphrase-like sentences and trimming some mantra-like closing lines would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is vivid and energetic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and stakes (“alternate timelines bleeding through like ink in water,” “Blade carving ethereal sigils that bound opposites”). There is some density of abstract nouns and repeated motifs (“pretense,” “opposites,” “void”) that verge on purple when stacked, but they rarely obscure basic sense. Sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum, and the action remains legible through the more metaphorical passages. Trimming a few declarative thematic sentences at the end would sharpen the closure image further.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and often do double duty for mood and information. However, the prose leans heavily on figurative density—“storm-born silence,” “velvet hush,” “orthogonal dreams”—which can feel purple and occasionally redundant. Some phrases and structural moves repeat without adding pressure (“Notably receptive,” the hush/possibility motif), slightly dulling momentum. Despite this, causality and closure remain unobscured, and the piece stays readable and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and multi-functional, often advancing atmosphere, action, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors like “macerating the unspoken like acid on bone” are vivid and legible, and repetition patterns feel purposeful rather than accidental. That said, figurative density is high throughout, occasionally flirting with purple and reducing contrast between quieter and climactic moments. Some slight pruning of modifiers and repeated constructions (“mournfully eager” appears several times) would sharpen impact without altering meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is lush and frequently striking, with many sentences carrying multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and concept at once). However, the density of figurative language is high enough that some lines feel redundant or slightly purple, and key concepts (“interiorizing,” “uncertainty,” “boundaries of light”) are reiterated in similar phrasing. Momentum occasionally softens under the weight of abstractions, even as clarity remains intact. A sharper edit for concision and variation would be required for immediate top-tier publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and memorable images; most sentences do more than one job. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, especially in the opening and closing, which edges into purple and occasionally feels stacked rather than clarifying. A few thematic and emotional notes (hopelessness, destiny, creative destruction) are reiterated in slightly different wording, adding mild redundancy. Despite this, action and causality stay clear, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, mood, and action) and the sequence of actions is easy to follow. There is some redundancy and ornament (“a symphony of tomorrows,” “practical magic, tuned true,” repeated creaking/echo motifs) that could be pared for greater force. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and on-theme; it doesn’t obscure the closure image. Minor overwriting in the final third keeps this from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level writing is generally strong, with fluent syntax and a good balance of action and description; sentences usually carry multiple functions (atmosphere plus plot or character). However, figurative language is quite dense—“bruised with twilight,” “permanent transient,” “binding filigree,” “fracturing realities”—and sometimes risks purple prose or redundancy. Despite that, clarity and momentum remain intact: cause/effect is never lost, and the closure image reads cleanly. A touch of pruning and more sparing metaphor would elevate the craft significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are controlled, images are often striking, and information density is high with minimal scaffolding. The prose occasionally veers toward abstraction and repetition (e.g., “unsettling calm,” “realistically imaginary,” “texture of connection”) and stacks metaphors in ways that risk slight saturation, but clarity remains intact. Momentum is maintained despite lyric density; each sentence tends to add either imagistic weight or conceptual progression. With a bit more pruning of near-duplicate concepts and reliance on the strongest images, this would reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with some strong images (“schools of phosphorescent fish darted like living constellations”) and efficient worldbuilding. There is some repetition and mild purple strain (e.g., “somber marvel” named repeatedly, layered abstractions like “cosmic solitude”) that slightly dull impact. The meta-textual parenthetical about word count at the end is jarringly out of frame and breaks immersion, indicating a seam rather than story. Overall momentum holds, but tightening and pruning a few decorative phrases would sharpen the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear and readable, with strong rhythm in places and some effective images (the hearing aid’s dead battery “humming faintly,” the mist “parting like a hush held breath”). However, there is substantial repetition of key phrases and constructions (“reeling hush,” “persistently curious,” “protect vulnerable voices,” “incidental heroism”), creating a sense of paraphrase loops. Figurative language and modifiers are sometimes stacked to the point of mild overwriting, which slightly dulls impact and momentum. Tightening and pruning would significantly elevate line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear, efficient, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and emotion (“pages whispering like distant surf,” “her body humming like overcharged fiber”). Momentum is steady, and there are few if any genuine scaffolding or paraphrase loops, despite some repeated motifs. However, body/emotion shorthand (“heart hammering,” “phobia clawing at her chest,” “tears mixing with saltwater”) and repeated phrases (“crashing hush”) edge toward cliché and minor over-writing. The figurative language remains coherent and does not obstruct causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery (ink swirling like nebulae, static roaring, opal refractions) and good information density per line. Sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum, and most details do double duty for mood and meaning. There are minor lapses—e.g., the awkward repetition in “Static roared like a storm, then abruptly cleared after the radio static cleared” and a few near-duplicate formulations (“midnight solace”)—that read as line-level slack. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; trimming a few redundant or explanatory phrases would sharpen an already solid surface.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and motion) and the rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from clumping. Imagery is generally precise and coherent (“towers of bone… ribs of ancient leviathans,” “diamond… catching the first light like a trapped scream”) with minimal mixed metaphors. There is some purple density and parallelism, but it rarely muddies sense or stalls momentum in this mostly reflective, accumulative mode. Minor tightening—trimming near-duplicate cadences and a few abstract phrasings—would push it closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is vivid and image-rich, with strong sensory density and some striking metaphors (“edges sharp as forgotten oaths,” “tears froze on her cheeks”). At times, though, it veers toward purple and repetitive—certain phrases and concepts recur with little new information, and most sentences in some stretches carry figurative language, softening impact. Despite the lushness, clarity of action and causality is maintained, and there are few true scaffolding lines. Trimming redundancies and varying figurative texture would lift it into a more rarefied tier.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and musical, with strong imagery (“violin string stretched taut,” “gears clattering like defeated bones”) and generally clear action. However, figurative language saturates nearly every line, nudging into purple; some repetitions and near-duplicates (“tarnished wonder,” “resonantly soft”) slightly dull impact. Momentum holds, but the density of metaphor sometimes competes with immediacy and pressure, especially near the climax. Tightening a few descriptive passes would elevate this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, most lines perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character), and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and on-theme, and the metaphors (“bruise-purple,” “slots gaping like unmet eyes”) feel specific rather than stock. A handful of moments verge on overstatement (“his motivation burned clear,” “thunderstorm humming soft rebellion”) where a lighter touch might preserve potency. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are never seriously compromised, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and largely precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and very few genuine redundancies or confusions. However, figurative density is high—almost every line carries an image—and certain phrases recur (“quietly persistent,” “whispering gleam,” “misting hush”) in ways that verge on self-conscious motif rather than necessity. This leans toward purple without fully tipping into muddle, and a bit of pruning could tighten momentum. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the final images land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often striking, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept, and very few outright clumsy constructions. However, figurative density is high and fairly unmodulated, with multiple metaphors and abstractions stacked in close succession (“hyperbolic dreams,” “non-Euclidean fury,” “curved potential”), which sometimes blur impact rather than sharpening it. There is also some conceptual repetition around solitude, analog memories, and hyperbolic geometry that could be trimmed without loss. Overall it’s above-average line work that would benefit from selective cutting and a bit more variation in sentence structure and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, syntactically varied, and generally dense with purposeful imagery; most sentences do more than one job. However, figurative language is very frequent (“improbable tendrils,” “whispering archipelago,” “luminous absence,” “cipher of longing”), tilting toward purple in places and risking numbness from repetition. There are mild paraphrase/texture loops around longing and whispers, though they do not obscure causality or closure. Trimming a few redundant modifiers would likely strengthen cadence and impact without altering meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level craft shows ambition, with frequent figurative language and attempts at rhythmic cadence. However, the prose is over-saturated with similar abstractions and stock-mystical phrases, leading to paraphrase loops and diminishing returns (“improbable longing,” “hush,” “cosmic possibility” recur without new information). Many sentences restate prior content in slightly varied terms, especially in the final third, which drags momentum and blunts the closure’s impact. A more ruthless compression and sharper, more concrete imagery would be needed to meet a prestigious venue’s standard.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is strong: images (“glass dome cracked like a shattered lens,” “constellations hung broken”) are precise and non-generic, and most sentences carry multiple burdens (worldbuilding, mood, character). There is some density of figurative language, especially early, but it largely remains coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright purple excess. Repetition is minimal and not scaffold-like; momentum holds despite the lushness. A touch more pruning in one or two highly ornamented sentences could sharpen propulsion further.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level work is often strong—“dust motes danced like forgotten specters,” “spines cracked like old bones”—and sentences tend to carry more than one function, maintaining momentum. There is, however, a density of figurative language and adjectival weight (“combative tenderness,” “polished facets,” “caged echo”) that occasionally borders on purple, with some near-redundant phrases around exile and resilience. Rhythm and clarity remain intact, but trimming a few metaphors and repetitions would sharpen impact. No major artifacts or syntactic confusions impede understanding, but the polish is not yet at top-tier minimality.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically aware, with many lines doing dual duty for mood and worldbuilding (e.g., “the roaring yet whispering waterfall”). However, figurative density is high—multiple metaphors and modifiers in close succession—creating a persistent purple hue that occasionally blurs rather than sharpens sense. Repetitions of key adjectives and constructions (“radiant hush,” “insatiably creative,” “essence”) feel more like stylistic habit than rigorous patterning. Despite this, clarity of action and causality holds, and there are few outright redundant sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and rarely redundant, with most figurative language supporting the core motifs of light, silence, and knots. Rhythm varies well across the piece, and the syntax remains clear even in more baroque constructions. There is mild risk of purple prose and phrase repetition (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) but it generally reads as purposeful patterning rather than padding. A slightly leaner approach in a few lines of description could sharpen momentum at peak-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with concrete images (brittle parchment, hairline fissure, dust motes) and a good sense of rhythm. Sentences often do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character. At times, modifiers and abstractions stack ("shielded openness," "methodically curious nature," "profound, empathetic hush"), nudging toward purple and reducing immediacy. Still, clarity remains high and there are few true scaffolding or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with many vivid, memorable phrases (“gelatinous archive of human ambition drowned”) and multi-tasking sentences that build mood and character simultaneously. However, figurative density is very high, especially in the middle and late paragraphs, edging into purple and occasionally feeling redundant or self-conscious. Physics metaphors are sometimes stacked in quick succession, mildly blurring impact and risking reader fatigue. Despite this, clarity of action and closure remains intact, and the prose generally propels rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level work is generally strong: images are concrete, sentences vary in rhythm, and most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and action at once). The prose occasionally veers toward purple with stacked modifiers and repeated special-words, but semantics remain clear and momentum doesn’t stall. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; the piece maintains forward motion despite its lyric density. A slight trim of adjectival load in a few sentences would elevate this to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    Many lines are vividly crafted, and several images (the ice-veined glass, captive auroras, fractal-etched lenses) are striking and economical in how they carry world, mood, and function. At the same time, figurative density is high, occasionally tipping into purple and making some beats feel more ornamental than necessary for this compressed length. Most damaging are the explicit drafting artifacts—“Wait, too many—trimming in mind,” “599—error, recount”—which shatter immersion and read as scaffolding left in the text. These artifacts occur in the final third, directly dulling the closure’s impact and lowering the overall line-level score.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: many sentences do double duty, advancing both world and emotion, and the read-aloud rhythm is appealing. However, there is frequent, dense figurative language—“starlight thickened dust motes into spectral confetti,” “starlit supernova”—that can feel ornamental and risks blurring rather than sharpening key beats. Some concept phrases (especially “spooled wholeness”) are repeated more as labels than as evolving images, creating mild echo and abstraction. These issues never fully derail clarity or closure, but trimming or varying a handful of metaphors would significantly increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences serve multiple purposes (world-building, character interiority, and thematic shading). Recurrent motifs of “hush,” “stillness,” and “fractally precise” risk minor repetition but largely feel pattern-driven rather than accidental, and clarity remains high even in dense lines. Metaphors and images are generally clean and aligned with the story’s concerns (mirrors, recursion, sky, bark) without sliding into incoherent purple prose. A touch more variation in sentence structure and slightly fewer stacked abstractions in mid-paragraphs would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“stranded luminance,” “veins of liquid starlight”) and good momentum; most sentences do more than one job. There is a mild tendency toward purple or redundant modifiers and a few repeated constructions, but they do not materially obscure events or pacing. Information is clear, transitions between beats are smooth, and there are no significant grammatical or syntactic distractions. Tightening a few lush phrases and repeated adjectives would elevate the polish to a more rigorously literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-rich (“mist clung…like forgotten sighs,” “prismatic ghosts of memory”), with good rhythmic variety. However, figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence, drifting toward purple and occasionally feeling interchangeable rather than precise, which slightly dulls momentum. Some concepts and phrases recur with minor variation (“driftwood nostalgia,” spectral/motes/aurora light) in ways that feel more like stylistic habit than escalating pressure. Clarity is never lost, but a tighter, more selective line would better match elite publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clean, grammatical, and varied, with only occasional edges of purple (e.g., “hope untangling into fullness”) that don’t significantly impede clarity. There’s some abstract phrasing and conceptual repetition, but not enough to feel like scaffolding or loops. Information density is respectable: most lines either build world, move plot, or reinforce tone. A touch more concrete embodiment in emotional beats would elevate the prose from solidly good to truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and the imagery is vivid and internally consistent. There is some repetition of key phrases and metaphors (“nested patterns,” “hush,” “bruised awe”) that edges toward purple but stays thematically purposeful rather than feeling like synonym churn. Syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical rhythm, and there are no significant clarity or grammatical issues. Trimming a handful of adjectival stacks could sharpen momentum without losing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. However, figurative density is very high—nearly every beat has a simile or metaphor—which risks purple over-saturation even though clarity is preserved. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. Minor tightening of repeated “graceless/clumsy” motifs and a few ornate comparisons would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with several striking images (bruised purples, ephemeral lattices of foam, the hollow chrysalis as vessel of transformation). Symbolic threads are clearly handled and not syntactically confusing. However, there is some metaphor and concept repetition (symphony, braids, divergence, translation of separation into connection) that verges on pounding the point. A few abstract or summary lines could be cut or sharpened for greater momentum and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, vivid, and information-dense, with many doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. However, figurative language is nearly constant (“narrative foam,” “mindful confetti,” “absence’s cradle”), creating a slight purple haze that can blunt impact and risk sameness of effect. A few conceptual restatements (“integrated, not broken”; reiterations of absence/beginning) function as light scaffolding that could be tightened. Clarity survives throughout, but trimming a few abstractions would sharpen the best images.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and economical for this mode; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are mostly fresh and legible, and rhythm varies well, avoiding mechanical cadences or obvious scaffolding. There is a mild tendency toward reiterating similar images or formulations (e.g., “sturdy brittle,” various “stored remorse” formulations), which slightly blunts impact but doesn’t impede clarity or momentum. No major overwriting, syntactic confusion, or artifacting touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful and highly imagistic, with strong sound-work and dense information per sentence. However, it occasionally edges into purple: stacked modifiers, repeated coined phrases, and an almost unbroken high lyric register that can blur rather than sharpen key beats. There is some redundancy in concept (“silos,” “bridges,” “hush,” “vigorous tender”) without additional nuance. Still, clarity of action is maintained, and most lines do at least two jobs, keeping momentum respectable.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and vivid metaphor, and the prose generally remains clear despite its complexity. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, producing occasional purple-prose saturation that slightly blurs impact and dynamic range. Some conceptual phrases (“quaking reverie,” “bone-helixes,” repeated “synaptic plasticity”) recur enough to feel patterned rather than freshly revealing. Even so, rhythm and syntax are well managed, and there are no serious clarity or coherence lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, cadence-controlled, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for image and atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and thematically aligned (refraction, mist, serpentine motion) without collapsing into muddle. There is some repetition of key adjectives and conceptual phrases that could be pruned or varied, but outright loops and scaffolding are minimal. Momentum holds across the piece, with no paragraphs that feel merely expository or redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level work is polished, with high information density and a clear, readable syntax despite the lyricism. There is some purple-leaning accumulation—multiple metaphors and modifiers in close succession—that risks saturation but mostly stays coherent. Redundancies are minimal, and each sentence tends to carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character). The prose could benefit from a touch more spareness at peak moments to sharpen impact, but no serious artifacts or muddle appear, including at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally concise for this lyrical mode, and most lines carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Imagery—“twilight bled purple,” “each pause a Morse of magnetic whispers,” “pawn’s shadow fell just so on the dented stone”—is vivid and mostly coherent, with few mixed metaphors or redundancies. There is a mild tendency toward density/purple description, especially in thematic summations, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or blur sense. No noticeable loops or scaffolding artifacts mar the closure beat, which lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with high information density and vivid figurative language, and it reads smoothly at the sentence level. However, it frequently edges into purple—metaphors and abstractions stack (“silence pulsed like a held breath…pregnant with communal joy…path incarnate”), leading to occasional redundancy and slight saturation. Some lines restate already-clear ideas in more ornate terms, which marginally slows momentum. Clarity survives, but trimming and sharpening would improve force and avoid over-writing.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, interiority, theme) and maintain momentum, and many images (“nose tracking the seedling's subtle exhales”) are both precise and apt. However, there is some purple stacking and conceptual redundancy—“tide’s thought,” “undercurrent of wisdom,” “wildflower hush,” “motion's gift: impermanence births peace”—that risks blurring rather than sharpening effect. A bit of trimming and more varied sentence rhythm around intense beats would heighten impact. No major scaffolding or clarity issues are present, but the density of figurative language slightly dulls the climax’s sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density: most sentences advance setting, plot, and emotion simultaneously. Rhythm modulates well between sweeping description and tighter action during the inversion flight and cavern sequence. There is some risk of purple prose and repetition (“whirling silence,” stacked modifiers like “hyper-vital moss”), but the figurative language stays coherent and doesn’t obscure causality or the closing image. Trimming a few intensifiers and redundant phrases would sharpen an already effective line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information. At times, figurative density and phrase repetition (“rapidly adapting,” “hazy precision,” reiterated statements of foresight) feel slightly overwrought and redundant. Expository sentences about AI behavior and the engineer’s warnings are efficient but a bit flat compared to the more vivid descriptive lines. Overall, line-level craft is strong but not yet trimmed to elite sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and high information density in most sentences. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, especially in high-pressure beats, creating a slight sense of purple saturation. A few phrases feel redundant or conceptually close (“sculpted hush,” “chisel’s spark,” “blade’s kiss”), adding a layer of ornament without new pressure. Despite this, clarity is rarely compromised, and the closure image remains legible and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax, few redundancies, and good momentum for a contemplative piece. Some metaphors and modifiers repeat or verge on purple (“avalanchingly quiet,” “unraveling grasp,” “harvest insights,” “weave between worlds”) without always adding new information. The key climactic and closing beats are understandable, but occasionally summarized where image-based dramatization would land harder. There are no major artifacts or confusion, but the prose could be tightened and sharpened to avoid mild overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is rich and mostly controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“joy equaled sorrow’s derivative” neatly encodes both world and obsession). Rhythm varies enough to keep the dense imagery from congealing, and action remains clear even in peak beats. That said, there is some purple stacking and conceptual repetition (vanishings, equations, turbulence) that could be trimmed for even sharper momentum. The declarative exposition of the final insight slightly undercuts the otherwise vivid, image-driven texture.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are concrete, many sentences do double duty (world + emotion), and the rhythm supports a contemplative, mythic mood. Some phrasing and motifs are repeated (“germinate,” “wonder,” “auroras,” “ridgeway”), edging toward mild redundancy, but not enough to blur meaning. A few lines verge on purple or explain what’s already dramatized, particularly around the pendant’s thematic function, yet clarity is never in doubt. Overall, the piece reads as polished and deliberate, if fractionally overwrought in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lush, image-dense, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority. Some metaphor clusters (“mist coiling like serpents,” “soul’s vast sea,” “watercolor dream”) approach purple, and a few abstractions (“Not madness, but merger”) flatten otherwise vivid work. There’s minor conceptual redundancy around the empiricist/mystic contrast and repeated motifs, but not enough to stall momentum or obscure causality. Overall, line-level craft is strong and memorable, just short of maximal precision due to occasional overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and a clear through-line of imagery, and almost every sentence contributes to atmosphere or plot. However, figurative language is heavily layered, sometimes redundantly (“time's unraveling tapestry” appears more than once; multiple stacked modifiers per noun), which edges toward overwriting and slightly blunts impact. There are no serious clarity issues, but trimming a few compounded metaphors and repetitions would sharpen momentum. Information density is good, yet the prose could benefit from more variation between highly figurative lines and plainer beats at moments of peak action.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and dense with imagery; many sentences pull double duty for worldbuilding and mood. There is some repetition of key adjectives and structures (“deliberate,” “quietly determined,” “azure defiance”) and a tendency toward saturated metaphor that edges into purple but does not obscure meaning. Momentum holds—no obvious scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops stall the story, and the line-by-line clarity remains high. A touch more variation in texture and a few strategic cuts to repeated concepts would elevate it to elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is vivid and often economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (e.g., “time folded like worn fabric,” “worlds whispered thanks as her cycle reset”). However, figurative language is frequent and occasionally edges into purple or redundancy (e.g., multiple variations on murmurs, blooms, and weaving) without always adding new pressure. There are no major clarity failures or syntactic artifacts; cause and effect remain easy to follow. Tightening metaphors and trimming a few near-duplicate beats would sharpen momentum and elevate the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.9)
    Much of the line-level writing is strong: vivid verbs, concrete images, and generally efficient sentences that braid mood and action. There is some drift toward purple (“luminescent ache,” “abyssal black”) but it mostly remains controlled. The major issue is the presence of obvious process scaffolding and contradictory fragments in the final third, which wreck immersion and cadence at the point where precision matters most. Those artifacts must be removed and the ending re-smoothed before the prose can meet elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is vivid and generally clear, with high information density—setting, magic system, and stakes are all carried in relatively few lines. However, it leans into purple repetition (“shadowed elation” recurs; “total internal reflection” is hammered) and stacks modifiers to the edge of clutter. Some sentences restate content with mild synonym churn rather than adding new pressure. Despite this, causality and the final image remain legible, so the line-level excesses are more cosmetic than structurally damaging.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant, image-rich, and rhythmically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Information density is high and transitions are smooth; there is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and at times adjectives and metaphors stack to the edge of purple, risking saturation and slight drag on momentum. Despite that, clarity remains intact and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, mood, character), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are imaginative (“brass arms bent like grieving limbs,” “roots gripping the earth like old secrets”) and generally coherent, though the density of figurative language occasionally skirts purple. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and grammar and clarity hold throughout. Minor over-ornamentation in places keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and efficient world-building, and most sentences carry both atmosphere and narrative weight. However, figurative language is dense and recurrent enough that some phrases blur into each other (“woven dawns,” “swaddled,” “greenhouse pulsed”) and the closing stretch lapses into summary-like reiteration of what the images have already shown. There are mild redundancy loops and a touch of purple prose, though not enough to obscure cause and effect. Tighter pruning in the final third would sharpen impact and reduce the sense of overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with strong sensory and atmospheric lines, but it edges into purple at times (“paradoxes unfolding like pages in a nested riddle,” “midnight bloomed”), creating some density that slows momentum. Certain concepts and phrases repeat in slightly varied forms (“enlarged tranquility,” “nestled paradoxes,” “stay while leaving”), resulting in a mild paraphrase-loop feel. Despite that, sentence-level clarity is solid, grammar and sequencing are clean, and most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, theme). Trimming some abstractions and redundancies would sharpen impact without losing the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and many images doing double duty (bread as object, memory, and moral weight). The prose occasionally overreaches into invented or clunky coinages (“heuristically gentle”) and stacked modifiers that call attention to themselves. A few conceptual redundancies (e.g., restating creeping normality) nudge toward ornament rather than propulsion but don’t seriously obscure sense or closure. With a slight tightening of purple edges, this would read at a very high literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and largely precise, with high information density—most lines carry worldbuilding, mood, and action simultaneously. Some phrases and structures are repeated (“gently meticulous,” “illusions faded to memory,” “quartz hush”), but they read as motif rather than pure scaffolding, though a tough edit could trim slight redundancy. Figurative language is occasionally stacked, edging toward purple, but remains legible and coherent. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum, and the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid verbs, multi-function sentences, and a good balance of description and motion with no major clarity slips. There is some mild repetition and near-paraphrase (“comforting unease,” “curiously steadfast,” re-summarizing the arc in the closing paragraphs) that slightly dulls the sharpness of the final image. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; it skirts purple now and then without collapsing into muddle. A bit of trimming in the last third—letting the recorded sounds and the image of Lila leaving at dawn stand without explanatory echoes—would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is often rich and multi-tasking, with inventive metaphors (“pheromone ballots,” “personal atmospheres”) and good sensory layering, particularly via taste. Yet the density of modifiers and figurative language sometimes tips toward purple, and several phrases restate prior ideas without new pressure (“no, recount precisely…final tally holds at essence”). The late bracketed scaffolding about adjustments and bounds reads as process residue, disrupting rhythm and dulling the closure image. Tightening repetition and cutting those artifacts would significantly lift line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished, largely concise at the idea level, and rhythmically varied, with strong, specific images (“spectral ribbons of violet and green that danced like sorrowful northern lights”). However, figurative language is dense and occasionally redundant, edging into purple in places without always adding new pressure. Information remains clear and sequential; no major loops or scaffolding blur causality. Line-level craft is strong but not yet at the seamless, high-tension refinement of a top-tier literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and dense, multi-tasking sentences that build atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Some lines flirt with purple or metaphor pile-up (“colossal crystal lung,” “Braille confessions,” “verdigris capturing whispers of unvarnished exchanges”), but they generally remain legible and purposeful rather than decorative noise. There is mild conceptual redundancy around candor, wilting, and “lost conversations,” yet not enough to noticeably stall momentum at this length. Tighter pruning of a few figurative flourishes and overt thematic restatements could elevate an already skillful line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images like “gales etched ancient hymns into the stone” and “glistens cascaded across its facets, refracting light into rainbows.” Information density is high and most sentences carry both image and concept. However, there is persistent purple tendency—stacked modifiers, repeated abstractions (“symphonies of truth,” “color of wonder,” “muted vigor”)—that slightly blurs edge and momentum. The line-level remains clear but would benefit, at a top-market standard, from some pruning and more varied texture between the lush and the plain.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, stakes) and the rhythm adapts to rising pressure. However, figurative density is very high—nearly every line reaches for an image—which edges into purple and risks dulling impact (“static roaring… like a thousand fragmented screams”). Some phrasing loops and intensifier clusters could be cut without loss, tightening momentum. Clarity of cause-effect remains intact, but a touch more restraint would elevate the prose to a top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is mostly clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with solid sentence-level control and few mechanical issues. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing (“stories’ method triumphant,” “her discerning eye vindicated”), and thematic statements occasionally paraphrase what the images already show. Figurative language is frequent but rarely incoherent; it occasionally smooths over rather than sharpens emotional complexity. Momentum holds, though the closing paragraphs could be tighter and less summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often vivid and information-dense, with several strong images (the dice, phosphorescent corridors, the AI reading dance). There is some purple excess and repetition of motifs (“as a spider spins its web,” “calm defiance,” variations on liberation) without each iteration deepening meaning, which slightly blunts impact. Sentences mostly carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, action), and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. Line-level craft is above average, but a modest trim of metaphor and reiteration would sharpen the piece for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, purposeful, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and apt; “gleaming silence” and similar phrases recur a bit, yet they support rather than swamp momentum. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops, and the action sequence (digging, striking the heart, piercing pockets) reads cleanly. Slight lushness and occasional stacked modifiers prevent it from feeling razor-honed, but it remains publishable-quality prose.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished at the sentence level, with strong verbs and evocative metaphors (“liquid starlight,” “velvet glide”) and mostly clean grammar and sequencing. However, figurative density is high almost everywhere, and certain constructions and phrases are reused enough (“whispered secrets,” “tranquil blaze,” “smoothed hush”) to feel like stylistic loops rather than fresh strokes. This purple-leaning texture occasionally blurs impact by making intense imagery the default rather than a strategic escalation. Momentum survives, but line-level restraint and variation would sharpen both clarity and emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished, with smooth syntax, clear sequencing, and a good balance of summary and scene for this length. Many sentences carry multiple loads (character, setting, and mood), and there is relatively little scaffolding or redundancy. At times the language veers toward purple or stacked modifiers (“streaks of fire rained down, mirroring the urgency in Elara’s chest”), and certain phrases recur in a way that feels more like patterning than necessity. These touches slightly blunt momentum and freshness at peak beats but do not obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often striking and image-rich, with many lines doing double duty for mood and theme (e.g., “a storm trapped in glass” for the quarantined memory). However, it leans into purple prose at times, with frequent modifiers and metaphor density that can feel more ornamental than necessary. Certain phrases and constructions recur (“tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve,” similar sentence cadences), creating minor echo and weight issues. For top-tier publication, this would need tightening to maintain propulsion and avoid over-saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are syntactically varied, images are vivid, and most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding plus psychology, or theme plus action). There is some overwriting—densely stacked modifiers and repeated constructions (“calibrated treason,” “wisely enduring,” multiple metaphor-laden clauses in a row)—that risks numbing rather than sharpening key beats. Still, clarity is rarely compromised, and the final images (the chain snapping, the thorn as “healing rather than harm”) land cleanly. Trimming a few adjectives and abstractions would raise its publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and efficient interweaving of description and action. Some passages verge on purple with stacked imagery (“serpentine nexus,” “universe hummed its secret song,” “armor gleamed like frozen tears”) and could benefit from an occasional plainer sentence to sharpen contrast. Nevertheless, clarity remains intact, and most sentences do more than one job. There are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts that drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“her breath fogging the air like borrowed starlight” is a representative success). Line-level clarity remains intact even in complex figurative constructions, and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym-churn. However, metaphor and image density is very high; nearly every sentence reaches for a flourish, which occasionally feels like over-embellishment and risks dulling impact through saturation. Trimming a few redundant intensifiers and slightly varied repetitions would sharpen momentum without sacrificing the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, musical, and dense with information doing double duty (image plus theme). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and phrases like “scintillatingly somber trails” and repeated “demure audacity” verge on purple and slightly self-conscious. There’s mild redundancy in restating the same thematic point across different metaphors. The prose remains fully legible and often gorgeous, but a light paring would sharpen it for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally tight and clear, with effective images like “dust devils died unborn” and “grapefruit-sized gem, milky with internal fractures.” Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing plot, world-building, and character—without much padding. There are occasional clichés or stock phrases (“pulse quickened,” “mind racing,” “for the first time, he questioned his crusade”) and some parallel-sentence summarizing that could be sharpened. Nonetheless, rhythm is varied, and there are no major loops or figurative muddles that harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with vivid figurative language and generally clean syntax; it reads smoothly aloud. Information density is high, and many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and story. Yet there is clear motif and adjective repetition (“gritty whimsy,” “cobalt,” “ancient shadows”) and a tendency toward stacked metaphors that occasionally feel purple rather than precise. These patterns nibble at momentum and freshness but do not seriously obscure meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is often beautiful, with strong imagery and sensory density (“melody frail as spider silk,” “ethereal vapors twist like auroras within the glass”). However, the prose leans toward purple in places, with stacked modifiers and frequent figurative language that sometimes feel ornamental rather than pressure-driven. There is some repetition of key phrases and tonal descriptors that could be pruned for greater punch. Clarity remains good, but a demanding editor would likely ask for tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is energetic and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion, but it frequently overreaches into ornament (“fleshly glow,” “spectral desire,” “fleshly ethereal embrace”) and stacks metaphors in quick succession. Repetition of certain adjectives and concepts (especially “fleshly,” “ethereal,” “logical/emotional”) creates a sense of lexical loop rather than deliberate pattern. Some sentences feel overstuffed, slightly blurring action clarity at high-pressure beats and dulling impact where a cleaner line would hit harder. Line-level control is solid but not yet at the precision or restraint expected for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and character (“Basalt walls absorbed sound, fostering the tone of restrained wildness that defined their haven”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, and momentum is maintained through the transition from sanctuary to viaduct to aftermath. There is slight risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition (basalt/wildness/patience motifs recur heavily), yet clarity and propulsion remain intact. No major loops or scaffolding artifacts impede reading, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, and momentum rarely stalls despite the lyrical register. There are occasional slightly abstract or layered metaphors (“subterranean veins pulsing with water,” “drought of will”) but they don’t materially obscure action or stakes. Little to no scaffolding or paraphrase loops appear, and the final cadence lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose yields many strong, evocative lines and images, and its density carries a clear aesthetic ambition. However, it often tips into purple: similes and abstractions (“vibrant hush,” “calm before realization,” “tools fine as whispers,” “second opinions weren’t luxuries”) recur, and some phrases are repeated nearly verbatim (“aptly deliberate,” “calm before realization”), creating a sense of wallpaper rather than escalation. Several sentences do similar atmospheric work without adding new information, modestly dragging momentum. The figurative language mostly coheres but would benefit from pruning and sharper contrast to let the best images stand out.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is vivid and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding, mood, and theme. However, figurative language is nearly continuous—“froth for salvage,” “sprockets gossiping steam,” “evolution’s lazy sprawl,” “viral rust”—and can blur edges rather than sharpen them, especially in the middle where it slightly drags momentum. Some conceptual repeats (irreverent awe, evolution framed in similar terms) read as mild loops rather than new pressure. The line-level craft is strong but would benefit from strategic restraint and a few clearer, plainer anchors at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose contains some strong images (“sprawling digital mausoleum,” “whispers across the echo of forgotten songs”) and maintains a fairly high information density. Yet there are noticeable artifacts: meta asides about counting words, slight paraphrase-y repetition, and occasional overworked abstractions (“sensed absence” is leaned on repeatedly without fresh inflection). Key climactic beats are often summarized, reducing line-level immediacy and momentum. These issues keep the piece from the tight, polished surface expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally precise and imagistic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and world-building (“mirrors tilting at odd angles like eavesdroppers”). However, figurative density is high throughout, and some phrases feel like conceptual restatements (“her anomaly no flaw but the courage to exist beyond binaries”) rather than fresh sensory work. There are mild repetition and slogan-like motifs (“map empathy onto action,” “courageous anomaly”) that read as scaffolding. Despite this, rhythm and clarity hold; the line-level craft is strong but not yet refined to elite restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, minimal scaffolding, and high information density with most sentences doing double duty (atmosphere plus character or theme). Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent (“fold in patience,” “crumpling sigh”) without mixed metaphors or opacity that would cloud action. A few lean toward purple or repeated register (“windborne solace” recurs in close proximity), but they do not significantly drag momentum or clarity. The final cadence is clean and earned, with no obvious loops or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and generally clear, with varied syntax and strong sensory images. At the same time, figurative language is dense and at times overripe (“mulled wine…carrying notes of clove and destiny’s quiet ache,” “intersubjective understanding”), edging into purple and occasionally feeling redundant. Some sentences restate similar emotional content with different metaphors, which slightly drags momentum. Line-level work is above average but would need tightening and selective restraint to reach elite publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and readable, with some strong images (“veins of golden tremors,” “clearings…like a lens of quiet”). However, the density of modifiers and recurring phrasing (“whisperfield calm,” “murmuring,” “echoes”) drifts toward purple and repetitive, flattening impact. Several adjacent sentences restate anxiety about preservation and calm in slightly different metaphors, creating minor momentum drag. Line-level craft is solid but would benefit from pruning and greater variation in image and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning, and the read-aloud rhythm is generally smooth. At times, though, the language drifts into purple and repetitive motifs (“perceptively calm,” “earnest whimsy,” “as vines climbed”), creating a sense of over-insistence. Some lines restate already-implied emotional states, slowing momentum in a piece that is already conflict-light. Even so, clarity remains high and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with metaphor doing real thematic work rather than mere ornament. However, there is some over-saturation of figurative phrasing and repeated constructs (“fractured sequences,” “reflected,” “crystal” metaphors) that occasionally feel redundant rather than additive. The rhythm mostly propels, but a few lines stack abstractions (“viral reflection,” “totality”) in a way that slightly blurs immediacy. Overall, the piece passes the read-aloud and momentum tests but falls just short of the most economical, razor-sharp high band.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, syntactically varied, and carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphorical language is frequent yet largely coherent and on-theme, and important actions—arranging driftwood, drawing sigils, recording and replaying—remain clear despite the lyric overlay. There is some repetition of favored terms (“tidal,” “echo,” “hush”) and figurative saturation that edges toward purple, which slightly blunts impact in places. Still, clarity and momentum are rarely compromised, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lines are generally strong, with high information density—many sentences do double duty conveying world, mood, and stakes—and the piece reads smoothly despite its conceptual load. However, there is noticeable purple-prose pressure: repeated adjectives (“luminous ache”), ornate metaphors (“luminous pearl in the void,” “stars smearing like tears”), and occasional near-redundant phrasings that could be pared back for sharper impact. The rhythm and clarity hold at the climax, so closure isn’t obscured, but some scaffolding and intensifier excess slightly dull momentum. A leaner, more selectively charged line would move this toward elite-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with dense, multi-purpose sentences that build atmosphere and thematic resonance without major clarity issues. Recurring phrases and motifs feel mostly deliberate rather than like scaffolding, and the rhythm modulates acceptably between descriptive and event beats. However, there is a clear tendency toward lush, almost purple description—stacked metaphors, repeated abstractions like “radiant” and “ethereal”—that occasionally feel more ornamental than necessary. Tightening a few of the more baroque lines and varying texture would elevate it to a truly elite line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, generally clean syntax, and very few redundant scaffolding lines. The figurative texture (spoons bending reality, teeth shaped like interlocking shadows, noon bells muffled by fog) is imaginative and mostly coherent. There is mild repetition (“quietly deliberate” echo) and a consistent high-ornament register that, while not quite purple, could benefit from a few plainer beats for contrast. No major artifacts or loops obscure meaning, and the closure image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and often lovely, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“tracing boxwood with fingers callused from setting shepherd bones”). Line-level clarity is strong; actions and images are easy to visualize, and there are no grammatical stumbles. That said, figurative density is high and some metaphors and abstractions repeat (“constellations,” “cleft,” “innovation”), creating a faint sense of conceptual looping rather than continual forward pressure. Trimming a few redundant thematic phrases would increase impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with strong images and few outright errors, and many sentences do more than one job. However, there is frequent metaphor and modifier stacking (“bloomed softly through the haze, a zephyr of celestial petals unfurling in her soul”) that sometimes drifts into purple and blurs precision. Certain formulations and key terms recur without fresh development (“memories resurfaced,” “bloom,” “zephyr,” etc.), creating a sense of lexical loop and diminishing impact. Line-level craft is competent and occasionally striking but could benefit from tightening and more varied figurative strategies.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with high information density and vivid images pulling double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “moss spores danced faintly in the light”). Syntax varies and reads smoothly, and there are no clarity-breaking errors. However, the prose trends toward purple in places, with stacked metaphors and repeated key phrases that don’t always add incremental value, leading to a sense of over-insistence. Tightening some redundancies (e.g., reiterations of “honeyed hush,” “vulnerability”) would sharpen momentum and give the best images more impact.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax, no major grammatical issues, and sentences that carry both atmosphere and action. However, the prose leans heavily into piled modifiers and repeated constructions, which at times blur impact (“swirling hush,” “feral nexus,” “ephemeral cameo appearance,” etc.) and create a mild sense of purple redundancy. Several adjacent sentences restate similar ideas (fog encroaching, hopes dragged toward oblivion) without adding new pressure. The result is evocative but somewhat overwrought, leaving room for tightening and greater variation in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory images (“gears fashioned from acorn shells and beetle wings,” “golden stories, luminous narratives”) that serve both worldbuilding and theme. While the language edges into lushness and repeats some phrases (“golden stories,” “harvest moon”), it mostly avoids true purple-prose muddle and maintains clarity. Sentences generally do multiple jobs—advancing image, mood, and story together—and there are few scaffolding or redundancy issues. A touch more restraint at peaks could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density; nearly every sentence advances image, world, or emotional charge. Figurative language is frequent but generally clear and internally consistent, and crucial beats (ignition, revelation, choice) remain legible. There is a mild tendency toward saturation—almost every line carries metaphor or elevated phrasing—which risks feeling purple in places, though it doesn’t obscure meaning. Trimming a few redundant intensifiers would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and image-rich, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and conceptual setup). However, figurative language and abstract phrasing are dense enough that some lines feel like variations on the same idea (angles, echoes, wounded season) rather than fresh advances, creating a slight sense of ornamental layering. The rhythm is mostly controlled, though the consistent lushness risks monotony over time. Clarity and momentum still hold, particularly around the concrete gear-click moments.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. Recurrent metaphors are generally coherent, but the line-level sometimes skirts purple, with frequent stacking of modifiers and repeated coined terms that slightly blunt momentum. Still, clarity is maintained through the climax—calcification and escape are intelligible—and there are few outright redundancies. Tighter pruning of figurative excess could elevate this to elite line-craft.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and largely efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for mood, character, and world (“wood dust sifted like fine sand,” “steam threading upward like a genie’s promise”). There is some density of figurative language and repeated conceptual phrasing that edges toward purple, but it rarely obscures sense or momentum. Line-level clarity and rhythm are high, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“past regrets bleeding into unborn futures like ink in rainwater”). However, figurative density is very high across nearly the entire piece, and some metaphors feel adjacent rather than cumulatively sharpening, which can slightly blur impact. There’s mild conceptual redundancy around erosion, regret, and spin that could be tightened for greater propulsion. Still, syntax is varied, clarity holds, and the closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, smoothly integrating description with action (e.g., rerouting power and water). There is some conceptual repetition of key motifs (“maze,” “flows,” “equations for hope”) that could be pared back for even greater sharpness. Figurative language is controlled and consistent; nothing crucial is obscured by purple prose or mixed metaphors. Line by line, the story moves forward without obvious scaffolding or loops, but it doesn’t quite reach the compression and surprise of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and largely clear, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character while maintaining readable cadence. That said, there is evident overwriting: intensifiers (“excruciatingly gentle”) and emblematic phrases are repeated, and metaphor density is consistently high even in otherwise quiet transitions. Some adjacent lines paraphrase similar emotional content (petrichor as nostalgia, hush as glacial) without adding new pressure, creating a slight sense of synonym churn. Line-level craft is good and often lovely but could be tightened for concision and variety to meet a truly elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often musical, with strong sensory detail, but carries notable repetition and purple overtones. Key phrases and concepts are reiterated with minimal new information, creating minor paraphrase loops and a sense of self-conscious motif rather than density. Figurative language clusters without always sharpening stakes or image, which dulls impact in a short form that demands extreme precision. Momentum survives, but line-level refinement would be required for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, vivid images, and generally efficient sentences that carry multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme) at once. Motifs like “oceanic hush,” “infinitely patient,” and the lightning/fulgurite imagery recur with clear intent, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. There is some flirtation with purple prose and density—figurative language appears in many consecutive sentences—which occasionally risks feeling ornamental rather than necessary. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and figurative muddle is avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, dense with information, and generally clear despite the figurative load. There is frequent metaphor and repeated phrasing (“lonesome splendor,” “geography of healing”) that edges toward purple and mild redundancy, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or closure. Scaffolding and boilerplate are minimal; nearly every sentence contributes to mood, character, or motif. A bit more restraint or variation in figurative density would elevate it to truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is vivid and often beautiful, with dense images like “gears grinding in eternal symphony, steam hissing from iron veins.” Yet the line-level texture is over-saturated: figurative language and modifiers appear in nearly every sentence, creating a uniform purple register that occasionally blurs impact (“quaking reverie,” “palace quaked,” “reverie shaking his soul”). There are mild repetition and echo loops around key words and concepts, which could be more ruthlessly pruned for concision and punch. Rhythm remains mostly controlled, but a leaner line in climactic beats would sharpen the closure image and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose often achieves striking images and strong cadence, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, occasionally tipping into purple and diluting impact, and there are minor redundancy and intensifier issues. Most damaging are the visible drafting artifacts in the middle and near the end, which puncture momentum and professional finish.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and rich with image, and there are few redundancies or mechanical slips. That said, the density of metaphor and conceptual phrasing (“temporal adhesive,” “core concept of cosmic endurance”) occasionally veers toward purple and slows momentum in what should be high-pressure beats. Trimming or grounding a few of these expository flourishes would sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush, imagistic, and often beautiful, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. However, figurative density is uniformly high, with frequent metaphor-stacking (petals as flowers, as time, as warnings, as veils) and lexical repetition (“quiet sigh,” “troubling serenity,” “approximated infinity”) that can dull impact over time. Some sentences paraphrase or restate earlier concepts with only minor variation, creating mild loopiness. Clarity and momentum survive, but strategic cutting and variation in texture would sharpen peaks and keep the lyricism from veering toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—most sentences pull double duty on atmosphere and theme—and the rhythm reads well aloud. Imagery tends toward the lush but usually remains coherent and on-theme; there are few, if any, mixed metaphors or outright clunkers. Some conceptual and phrasal repetition (the migration’s “thundering calm,” the reiterated explanation of the family’s customs) could be trimmed for tautness, and a couple of lines explain what the imagery already implies (“not chaos, but a fierce symmetry”). These are minor issues, but at this venue’s standard they keep the line-level from feeling fully honed.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often strong, with vivid verbs and well-chosen concrete details (frothing waves, polished brass, pulsing rake handle) that carry multiple layers of meaning. There is some overwriting and repetition—metaphors like “searing reverie” recur, and certain sentences restate prior content with heightened diction rather than new information. Rhythm and clarity remain intact, but occasional purple flourishes (“gears whispering secrets of time's relentless march”) risk drawing attention to themselves. Overall, line-level craft is solid, just shy of the restraint and precision needed for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with good information density and vivid images; almost every sentence advances atmosphere or mythos. There is some overwrite and motif repetition (e.g., “velveteen gloom,” frequent “tenderly”) that risks feeling mannered rather than strictly necessary. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent, and causality remains clear despite the lushness. Line-level craft is solid and nearly publication-ready, but could benefit from selective pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatical, often vivid, and information-dense, with some pleasing turns of phrase and controlled rhythm. There is, however, a tendency toward purple abstraction and repetition of key terms (“groundedly imaginative,” “sustaining transformation,” variations on “mapping ignorance”) that could be tightened. Several adjacent lines paraphrase similar ideas about models and innovation, slightly blurring momentum. The closure image is clear enough, but the surrounding declarative summaries sap some of its sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with high information density and many images doing double duty for mood and world-building. Prose is clear despite its lyricism; action and causality are not obscured, and the ending cadence is well judged. However, figurative language is dense and sometimes repetitive (e.g., multiple returns to “thistled calm,” glow descriptors), flirting with purple in places without always adding new pressure. Trimming a few metaphors and redundancies would sharpen momentum to a more elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is often strong: high information density, rich imagery, and generally controlled rhythm that matches the solemn atmosphere. There is some tendency toward stacked abstractions and repeated phrases around the “mirage of safety” that flirt with purple but remain mostly legible. The major issue is the obvious generation/scaffold artifact in the final line, which both breaks tone and damages the closure image. That blemish, appearing at the story’s end, weighs disproportionately on the prose score.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: syntax varies, information density is high, and many sentences do double duty for setting and character. Images are often striking (“sedimentary layers compressing centuries like forgotten grudges”), and momentum rarely stalls. That said, figurative language is very frequent, edging towards purple in places, and certain concepts/phrases (“agonized,” “abrasive calm,” “narratives”) repeat without always adding new nuance. Trimming a few redundant formulations would sharpen impact and further tighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images and rhythmic sentences that carry atmosphere. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, and key motifs (rosette, braiding, subtraction of noise) recur with intention. There is some purple excess and prompt-echo phrasing (“expectantly resigned,” “across unlearning hatred”) that reads mechanical and could be trimmed for concision and impact. Momentum remains acceptable, but a lighter touch on modifiers and abstractions would sharpen the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) and avoid obvious loops or scaffolding. Imagery like “memories mingling like herbs in a reduction” and “cosmic prune” is vivid and apt, with only rare brushups against purple prose. Explanatory blocks about the fruit’s neuroscience and the Regime’s strategy are a bit heavy-handed and could be tightened for momentum. Overall, rhythm and clarity hold, but the balance between lyric image and expository explanation could be more ruthlessly edited for elite-level concision.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and generally effective metaphors; the “nectar dusk” and hive/bee lexicon create a tight motif without clear muddle. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and description is mostly doing double duty (world-building plus emotional color). A few lines approach overstatement or redundancy (“truth raw kills wonder,” “routine shattered, wonder preserved”), but they don’t significantly drag momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final image ties back to earlier language with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong and musical, with many lines doing double duty for mood and meaning (“cherry blossoms drifted like forgotten sighs”; “a translucent sliver of pure quietude, humming with subdued fire”). Information density is high, and there are few outright redundancies. However, the figurative load is heavy across much of the piece, occasionally feeling slightly over-saturated and smoothing over sharper turns or concrete specifics. Trimming a few metaphors and varying texture would likely heighten impact at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally clear, and often do double duty for atmosphere and emotion (“anemones pulsing like forgotten heartbeats,” “tone incisively kind—slicing through her rage with compassionate precision”). There is a tendency toward high metaphor density and repeated abstract terms (“certainty,” “nuance,” “revelation,” “cascaded”), which occasionally flirts with purple prose and could be pruned for even greater impact. Momentum is mostly preserved despite lushness; the key causal beats remain intelligible. No major artifacts or loops mar the closure, though a touch more syntactic simplicity at peak turns might sharpen drama.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong and purposeful, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept, and there are few if any true scaffolding or synonym loops. Mathematical and physical metaphors are apt and mostly clear, and the cadence supports an accumulative, incantatory feel. However, density of figurative language is high, and certain phrases recur enough to verge on self-conscious motif rather than organic emphasis. A slight trim of reiterative abstract phrasing would sharpen impact without changing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and usually do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned (smog vs saffron, chains of kindness, inks as rebellion) without sliding into muddled metaphor. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is steady despite the lyric mode. The prose occasionally skirts purple and slightly over-insists on beauty, which adds a touch of drag but doesn’t obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and the narrative flows clearly despite its lyricism. However, figurative language is very frequent and sometimes stacked (“thundered like forgotten gods,” “flowers themselves wept toxin,” “thaw into rebirth”), which risks purple prose and slightly blurs impact. There are mild repetition patterns (rosewater dread, historically oriented souls) that could be tightened. Still, momentum from mid-story onward mostly holds, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do more than one job (world, mood, and plot), and rhythm generally accelerates appropriately as pressure rises. However, there is noticeable repetition and near-prompt-churn (“neatly inventive,” “bleak exhilaration,” “latent radiance,” “counter-clockwise”) that occasionally reads ornamental rather than strictly necessary. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; a few lines verge on purple stacking (“sickly green glow seeping like bile from cracks”) yet do not obscure sense. Tightening redundant modifiers and varying phrasing would elevate momentum and distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is vivid and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the rhythm generally propels rather than stalls. However, metaphor density is very high—“repulsive allure,” “lingering luminance,” and similar constructions recur often—and sometimes risks purple repetition rather than fresh advancement. A few phrases feel like near-synonym loops, and the constant figurative pressure slightly blunts the climax instead of sharpening it. Line-level clarity remains intact, but a stricter edit would be needed for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty for image and mood (“clouds churned like ink spilled across bruised sky”) and a smooth acoustic flow. However, the prose verges on purple in places with frequent figurative stacks and repeated jargon (“fractal,” “resonance,” “euphony”) that slightly blunt impact through overuse. Some phrases feel like near-paraphrases of prior ideas rather than fresh escalations, introducing minor redundancy. Clarity at the climax holds, but trimming or varying a few metaphors would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: dense but mostly efficient sentences, few if any redundancies, and clean grammar and sequencing; nearly every line advances atmosphere, world, or causality. Figurative language is frequent (“molten gold,” “horizon demands tribute,” “eyes that drank curiosity”) but coherent within the established mythic register and rarely confuses literal events. There is some risk of over-saturation—repeated dread/sunlight metaphors and slightly stacked modifiers—but momentum is preserved and the climactic crack and brine imagery land clearly. The lushness is impressive yet not fully disciplined enough to escape a small deduction for flirtation with purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are mostly clear, grammatical, and varied enough in rhythm to avoid monotony. The prose carries atmosphere effectively, but metaphoric patterns (ivy as lies, petals as illusions) are reiterated until they verge on heavy-handedness. Several late paragraphs summarize future monographs and societal impact instead of leaving a sharper, image-driven closing cadence. There’s little outright clutter, but more ruthless compression and trust in image over explanation would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is often striking, with some memorable images, but it leans into purple density: figurative language appears in a high proportion of sentences, and key motifs (“hushed blaze,” “interlaced absence,” waves whispering histories) are reiterated close to the point of redundancy. This occasionally muddies rather than sharpens the moment-to-moment experience, especially in high-pressure beats where simpler, more concrete syntax would increase impact. There are few outright clarity errors, but some sentences feel like variants of the same conceptual gesture, slightly dragging momentum. Tightening metaphors and trimming duplicative lines would substantially lift this to a more publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear, varied, and purposeful, and many carry dual loads of atmosphere and story (“shadows clung to sodden shelves like forgotten regrets”). There is some purple-leaning density—stacked modifiers and repeated coined phrases (“reclaimed stillness,” “blackout's hush,” “dappled resolve,” “tranquilly perceptive”)—that risks feeling mannered rather than entirely organic. Still, momentum is maintained, scaffolding is minimal, and figurative language stays coherent. Tighter pruning of repeated abstractions would elevate this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and striking metaphors (“shadow peel away like smoke from a dying ember,” “glass basilica… capturing fragmented dreams like dew in crystal webs”). However, figurative language is packed into nearly every sentence, and repeated terms (“luminous,” “torment,” “radiant agony”) create a mild purple-prose feel that can blur impact. There are no major clarity issues or loops, but some pruning and varied texture would sharpen momentum and make the peaks hit harder.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with good momentum and clear sequencing; images often do double duty for atmosphere and character. However, it leans toward purple in places, with repetitions (“unused potential pools,” “bleak exhilaration,” “intangibly tangible”) and slogan-like lines (“sovereign of the unseen”) that feel slightly overdetermined. Most sentences remain clear despite the figurative density, and there are few, if any, genuine muddles or scaffolding loops. Tightening a handful of adjective stacks and repeated formulations would bring it closer to elite-line precision.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: clear syntax, good flow, and a high density of concrete images working double-duty for mood and worldbuilding. There is some recurring phrasing (“brilliant dimness,” “perpetually surprised”) and moments of near-purple abstraction, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or momentum. Most sentences advance scene and atmosphere simultaneously, with minimal scaffolding. The prose is polished enough for many markets, though the heaviest venues would likely ask for a slight trim and deflation of a few on-the-nose lines.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and many images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some tendency toward purple prose and motif overuse (driftwood carvings, hush, regret reiterated in similar phrasings), which adds a thin layer of redundancy. Despite this, clarity remains strong, and the final images (terrace in blue twilight, watch hand held to dying light) land cleanly. Tighter pruning of repeated metaphors and abstraction would bring the prose closer to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.7)
    Individual lines often carry strong rhythm and evocative images, and sentences usually do double duty for atmosphere and character. That said, figurative density is high—metaphors and abstractions accumulate (“recycle shadows into light,” “every mistake to mosaic,” “furrowed hush”) in ways that sometimes feel ornamental rather than necessary. There are mild paraphrase loops and theme restatements that could be cut for tighter momentum, especially in the closing paragraphs. The prose is competent and occasionally striking but leans into purple patches that slightly blur impact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often strong at the line level, with many sentences doing double duty for image and interior state. That said, figurative density is high—waves, regrets, poles, and faith all carry multiple metaphors, sometimes stacked—so a few lines feel purple or redundant rather than cutting. Phrases like "backlash slithering up," "heavy as anchors," "lifeline rosary," "expectations collapsed" pile on concepts that slightly blunt momentum. Clarity remains intact, but some pruning would sharpen impact and raise this to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often striking and economical in its better moments, packing setting, mood, and character into single lines. There is a noticeable tendency toward ornate metaphor and adjective stacking, which occasionally tips into purple and risks blurring rather than sharpening (“bioluminescent algae that danced in delicate robust currents”). Some repetitions and echo-phrases function more as aesthetic flourish than added pressure, softening momentum but not obscuring causality. With a pass to prune redundancies and over-decoration, this would be strong line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is competent and often evocative, but heavily overwritten: figurative language and ornate modifiers appear in nearly every sentence, producing purple-prose drag. Several phrases and constructions recur with minimal new information (“paradoxically steady,” reiterations of eternal moonlight and cosmic intimacy), creating paraphrase loops. While clarity generally survives, momentum suffers, and some images feel generic or templated rather than precise. Tightening and pruning would significantly increase power without sacrificing mood.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, worldbuilding) and propel the piece forward, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Metaphors such as the moon “like a bruised lung” or the glade’s beauty as a “velvet noose” are vivid and thematically aligned, and the prose maintains clarity despite its density. However, the sheer frequency of figurative language edges toward excess and occasionally risks numbing effect rather than escalation. Tightening a few over-rich lines would increase impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished, with clear syntax and a good balance of sentence lengths; most lines carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and action at once). Some figurative density edges toward purple—phrases like “alchemical integration of her dark aspects” and repeated “shimmer”/“spectral”/“ghostly” clusters risk redundancy. Nonetheless, causality remains clear and momentum is maintained through the central sequence of stitching and confronting shadows. Trimming a few abstract modifiers would elevate an already strong line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding (“a destitute philanthropist whose pockets held only lint and whose heart overflowed with gifts for the forgotten”). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and certain phrases (“vibrant hush,” “glows,” “dance”) recur enough to feel mildly overworked. Some sentences could be tightened without loss of nuance, but clarity and momentum remain intact. There are no major loops or syntactic artifacts that damage the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally grammatical, clear at the level of action, and often striking in individual images. However, figurative language is overconcentrated and frequently recycled (light/thief/sly/winking/hush/sparks), creating a sense of sameness and mild clutter. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about hush, glow, and intrigue without adding new pressure or information. This ornamental accumulation slows momentum and slightly dulls the closure image, which leans on already-familiar metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Some figurative language clusters (“living smoke,” “borrowed dawn,” “trapped infinities”) flirt with purple prose, but they largely remain controlled and thematically aligned. There is minor repetition and a few near-redundant intensifiers, yet they don’t materially slow momentum or obscure the climax. The final run of short, patterned sentences gives a satisfying cadence without reading as template-scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, theme) and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy that doesn’t add nuance. Metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically aligned (scars/constellations/cartography/lightning), and the prose passes a read-aloud rhythm test. That said, figurative density is very high, with repeated constructions (“storm-kissed,” “furiously tranquil,” “masks slip,” “rarefy”) that sometimes feel like motif overuse rather than organic recurrence. The mild purple tinge in places slightly dulls impact but doesn’t obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, clear, and image-rich, with good syntactic variety and strong verb choices. However, there is a tendency toward purple density (stacked modifiers, frequent metaphors) and some phrase repetition that could be trimmed for greater sharpness. Most sentences do at least two jobs—advancing action while maintaining atmosphere—so momentum is preserved despite the ornamentation. No major artifacts or confusions mar the climax, but a leaner line-level pass would be needed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied, and packed with information, and the prose sustains a consistent aesthetic. However, figurative language is very dense—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or heightened image—so the accumulation sometimes blurs impact and edges into purple. A few phrases and concepts recur with near-identical wording (“luminous fracture,” “forge beauty from anarchy,” “blooming resistance”) creating mild echo rather than fresh progression. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closing image is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is vivid, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood, and the final cadence with the clock chiming is clean and effective. However, figurative density is high—many sentences carry stacked modifiers or metaphors—which edges toward purple and risks numbing impact. There are minor redundancies in phrasing and emotional labeling, but they do not significantly obscure causality or dull the closure image. Overall momentum holds, yet a leaner line would likely elevate both tension and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density: many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Metaphors are generally coherent and on-theme, and there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. However, the line-level is consistently “turned up to 11”—nearly every sentence reaches for a luminous image, which risks slight saturation and makes emotional modulation flatter than it could be. A touch more restraint or variation in intensity, especially at transitions, would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often striking (“bonsai shaped like a spectral galleon,” “rocks glistening under a sky bruised with cerulean regret”), with good sentence-level rhythm and few technical slips. However, it verges on purple at times, stacking modifiers and metaphor in a way that risks dilution, and certain phrases (“cerulean regret,” “rhythmically placid,” “diffuse”) recur enough to feel like scaffolding rather than deliberate refrain. Some sentences restate similar ideas (regret as tide/diffusion/anchor) without adding new pressure. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact through the ending image.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.2)
    Syntax is repeatedly broken to accommodate required phrases, resulting in comma splices and nonsensical grammar (e.g., "watching as the patterns spread gradually, preprocesses reality by..."). These text artifacts disrupt the reading flow and clarity. The prose relies on purple descriptors ("bloated with supernova drama") that muddy the sense.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from severe scaffolding artifacts, repeating prompt phrases ("steadily adaptive" x4, "drifting resonance" x2, "scorched testament" x3) to the point of distraction. This repetition creates a template-like cadence that undermines line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by clunky appositives used to insert prompt requirements (e.g., "Elara, the capsize survivor"). Several "tell" filters ("noticed something peculiar," "spoke of resilience") distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    Craft is marred by clichés ("cracks mirroring the fractures in his spirit") and tautologies ("domed ceiling a cracked dome"). The verbatim repetition of "inadvertently stubborn" and "permanent address" creates drag and reads as unpolished.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe artifacting creates a mechanical rhythm; the prompt phrases "gently persistent" (5 uses) and "amplified quiet" (4 uses) are repeated verbatim, flattening the prose texture. Dialogue feels artificial ("Why invite wolves to our door?"), serving as expository scaffolding. The reliance on summary creates a "told" rather than "shown" experience.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.6)
    Significant repetitive phrasing mars the prose; "foggy lucidity" (or variations) appears three times, and "spiritually curious" three times in a short space. Clichéd similes ("like a half-remembered dream") and filter-heavy narration weaken the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.2)
    Frequent repetition of root words ("quaking," "reverie," "retrocognitive") and tautologies ("trembled in quaking") significantly hamper the prose rhythm. Adjectival density often clogs the momentum of the action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=2.8)
    The text suffers from severe artifact looping, with "staggering grace" appearing three times and "patiently strategic" twice in a short space, including at the closure. This repetitive forced phrasing creates a scaffold effect that destroys rhythm and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with evocative imagery like "pop like crystal under ice" that lands effectively. The integration of backstory and technical explanation is generally smooth, though the exposition regarding the "mitosis/memory" link is slightly clunky compared to the surrounding scene work. Line-level propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetitive phrasing drags the quality down; "quietly savvy," "luminous," and "reinterpreted" appear repeatedly as crutches. The phrase "disbelief flickered luminous" is stylistically awkward. The prose feels constrained by a checklist, leading to scaffolded sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose is heavily overwritten, relying on adjectival stuffing and mixed metaphors ("igniting stars rather than propane"). Specific prompt phrases ("weighty lightness," "thoughtfully spirited") are shoehorned in awkwardly, creating repetitive artifacts. The writing tells (narrating the task) rather than shows, and the density of figurative language obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=1.4)
    The prose is melodramatic summary ("quaked with terrors," "vessel for stars' daring") interspersed with raw drafting artifacts. The text fails to dramatize scenes, relying entirely on telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from critical flaws, including severe phrase looping of prompt terms and the inclusion of generation meta-commentary ("But wait, that's over...") that interrupts the closure. These artifacts shatter the narrative spell and render the piece unpublishable in its current state.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe keyword stuffing degrades the prose; forms of "amalgamate" appear six times and "remarkably composed" four times, creating a drumbeat of artificiality. The loop sequence relies on repetitive sentence stems ("In that cycle," "Third loop," "Fifth loop") that flatten the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is dense with adjective stuffing and "therapy-speak" ("projection of fear," "confront their own honesty"). The required phrases are shoehorned awkwardly ("the timeframe after words become unnecessary"), disrupting the rhythm. Repetitive phrasing ("ambiguously clear" used twice) and reliance on abstract nouns weaken line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    Despite lush imagery, the prose is marred by objective proofreading errors ("a ancient fountain," a comma splice: "spread like ivy, three auditors") and some cliché phrasing ("thrusting defiantly"). These distinct flaws prevent the work from meeting the standard of immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=2.8)
    The text contains severe artifacts—specifically, literal editing notes ("Word count finalized at 712") and meta-commentary embedded in the prose—which render it unpublishable. Beyond these fatal flaws, the prose is often overwrought ("infused with the steady pulse of recycled starlight that mimicked a heartbeat"), relying on mixed metaphors and adjective-heavy description.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.1)
    The action beat at the climax ("slashed his violin string across a lantern's base, yanking it free") is physically confusing and opaque; it is unclear how a string cuts or moves a heavy lantern base. The prose is overwritten with adjective-heavy description ("sluicing," "bloomed vividly") and suffers from the forced insertion of prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and heavy metaphorical density (e.g., "sheets clung... like reluctant prophecies," "creaking like an old grief"). This constant mediation of physical reality through abstract similes blunts immediacy and creates a "purple" texture that drags on the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.2)
    The phrase "drowsy alertness" is repeated three times in a short text, creating a distracting lexical loop that breaks immersion. The prose suffers from "telling" at peak moments ("feather-light revelation") and occasional overwriting ("static-laced companionship").

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and modifier stuffing ("bioluminescent fungi," "weary shoulders," "latent secrets"). The phrase "core concept" appears as a jarring label within the narrative flow. The density of clichés ("untold seasons," "forgotten dream") and synonym churn ("crumbling peace," "gentle erosion") dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("softly adaptive" x5, "cautious exuberance" x4, "dreaming roots" x4) destroys immersion and reads like a checklist. This constitutes a major text artifact failure, rendering the prose mechanical and repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetition of epithets ("odd historian," "oddness," "oddly" ~5 times) and exact phrase loops ("bronze quiet" x3) stifle narrative momentum. Heavy reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("voiceless murmurs," "fragile remnants") creates a padded, monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.5)
    A notable repetition artifact occurs with the phrase "familiar enigma" appearing in paragraphs 2 and 14. Clichés ("wind howled," "heart pounding") and the illogical techno-babble regarding the oven-baked microdots mar line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt keywords ("plumb/plumbed" x5, "decorated" x4) which feels mechanical rather than rhythmic. Additionally, the misuse of literary terms (labeling a standard compound sentence a "zeugma") undermines the story's intellectual premise.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe penalty for lexical loops ("upturned hush" appearing in the opening, middle, and closure beat). Overwritten metaphors ("silence pooled like spilled mercury") and mixed imagery often obscure rather than clarify the action.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and abstract noun pile-ups ("convolutions," "equilibrium," "luminescence"), creating density without clarity. Clichés like "burning motivation" and "crystal beads" dilute the imagery. The phrase "darkening brightness" reads as a forced oxymoron that confuses rather than evokes, and the technical buzzwords clash with the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.8)
    Extreme repetition of specific phrases ("faint rustle of turning seasons" x4, "audibly muted" x3, "enthrall" x4) creates a stuttering, template-like rhythm. These text artifacts severely disrupt flow and readability, reading more like a constraint exercise than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several repetitive artifacts mar the prose: "layered tranquility" appears three times, and "faintly" is repeated in the final two sentences ("echoed faintly," "smiled faintly"). Adjective stacking ("credibly curious nature") feels awkward and forced.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from heavy "purple" overwriting and visible scaffolding artifacts ("the core concept laid bare," "motivation crystallizing"). The integration of prompt phrases is clumsy, resulting in repetitive and grammatically awkward sentences that drag on the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    The text suffers severely from "synonym churn" and artifact loops, repeating specific phrases ("ethically playful," "texture of time," "uncovering layers") multiple times in a short space. This repetition renders the prose algorithmic and clumsy, obscuring the narrative flow with obvious prompt-checking.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from repetition ("unbound/unbinding" appears frequently) and awkward phrasing forced by element integration ("acoustically perceptive ears" reads clinically against the mythic tone). Some descriptions verge on purple ("mourned the lost green roar").

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is heavily marred by loop artifacts and redundant tagging. Key phrases are repeated to the point of distraction: "professionally thorough" (4x), "affectionate" (6x), "static" (8x), and "half-truth" (5x) within a short word count. Additionally, stock metaphors like "blooming like a forbidden flower" and "honeyed light" reduce the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetition artifacts: distinct phrases ("whimsically attentive," "cautious exuberance," "shrewdly") are repeated 3–4 times each, creating a clunky, checklist-like texture. This mechanical repetition overrides any natural prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from heavy adjectival padding and tautologies ("conversations blooming like night-fragrant blooms"), creating a dense, sluggish rhythm. Required phrases are inserted mechanically ("boldly sympathetic" appears twice as a modifier; "luminescent ache" is repeated verbatim), disrupting natural flow. The writing prioritizes decorative language over clarity and momentum, frequently using "purple" descriptors that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmic, with striking imagery like "embryos of roars." However, adjectival density occasionally slows the pacing ("iridescent water," "translucent sculptures"), and a few similes ("pierced... like ancient teeth") feel slightly familiar rather than fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective-noun clutter ("gently inventive hands," "spectral reflections," "buried optimism"). There is a tendency toward abstraction where concrete verbs would be stronger ("ambiguous loss had fractured him"). While the imagery is often striking, the density of metaphors in the climax mutes the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.8)
    A severe verisimilitude error—a phonograph needle cannot produce sound from magnetic tape—shatters the climax's believability. Additionally, lexical loops ("sapphire," "hush") and grammatical awkwardness ("moved kindly methodical") clutter the prose and disrupt the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from high repetition of prompt terms ("sustaining," "reconstruct," "reluctant") within a short space, creating a scaffolded feel. Overuse of adjectives and adverbs ("inexorable," "verdant") slows momentum and results in overwritten lines.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers severely from keyword stuffing and repetitive phrasing. Specific phrases ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe," "thresh meaning") are repeated 3–4 times each in a short space, creating a jarring, mechanical rhythm (Text Artifact penalty applied). This repetition breaks immersion and reads like a checklist being forced onto the page rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.4)
    Repetitive phrasing creates significant artifacts; "bright darkness" appears three times, and the clunky prompt phrase "steadily unpredictable" is used twice in identical structures. These repetitions disrupt the prose rhythm and feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    Line-level craft suffers from awkward phrasing driven by prompt insertion, specifically "reactively visionary," which appears twice and reads like a stat-block label. The prose during the climax degrades into a scaffolded list, stripping the scene of momentum and sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of prompt phrases ("trembling certainty" appears three times; "analytically artistic" and "bad habits/new starts" appear twice). These repetitions create a template cadence that feels artificial and limits lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from extreme artifacting; the phrase "courageously kind" appears five times, and "sculpting space" and "unheard symphony" appear four times each in a short text. This repetitive looping creates a template-like cadence that obscures the action and mimics a checklist. The reliance on adjective-heavy construction ("sodden fisherman," "weathered magic square," "frantic rhythm") reduces narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=2.5)
    Prose is heavily laden with abstract "purple" metaphors ("bruised violets," "veins of liquid iron") that blur imagery. The prompt phrase "hushed thunder" repeats five times, creating a distracting loop artifact rather than a resonant motif, and modifier density impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally overwritten with adjective-heavy phrases ("vigilant poise," "unnatural pulse") that slow the momentum. The descriptions are generally strong, but the density of figurative language sometimes crowds the action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from significant redundancy (e.g., "crowned the mountaintop like a verdant crown") and synonym churn. Repetitive lexical choices ("blooming/bloom" used 6+ times, "refract" 8+ times) and forced prompt insertions ("earnestly studious care") disrupt the rhythm and transparency of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from "telling" rather than showing, particularly in motivation ("Driven by a profound motivation") and concept definition. Phrasing occasionally drifts into abstraction ("core concept," "vessels brimming with layered narratives") that distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and metaphor ("time itself turned a final leaf," "whisper of closing pages"), often violating the standard of concision. This "purple prose" tendency slows momentum and obscures the physical action in key beats. While grammatically sound, the style draws attention to itself rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose suffers from frequent emotion labeling ("Hope flickered," "Hope surged") and abstract phrasing ("gritty essence," "ancestral warning"). Repetitive verbs ("bloomed" appears three times) and clunky adverbs ("intuitively," "stealthily") clutter the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe repetition artifacts are present: the phrase "dawnlit melancholy" appears four times and "purposefully curious" twice, creating a distractingly mechanical rhythm. These loops clutter the prose and dull the emotional impact of the imagery, triggering a substantial penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily saturated with adjectives, adverbs, and clichés ("mist... like a lover's breath," "heartfelt passion," "artistry incarnate"), which stifles momentum. High-density descriptions often confuse the physical action, prioritizing decoration over clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant loop artifacts and synonym churn damage the prose. The phrase "worrying tranquility" is repeated three times; "dry wit" appears four times; "subtly confident" appears three times. These repetitions read as lack of lexical control rather than intentional motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=1.8)
    The prose suffers from severe, mechanical repetition of keyword phrases: "wild hush" appears 7 times, "cryptic" 6 times, and "infinitely patient" 5 times in a short text. This creates a drumbeat of artifacts that destroys flow and reads like a checklist rather than a story. Mixed metaphors ("mortar knitting like healed flesh") further clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetitive artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "lonesome splendor" appears three times, and "time ran short/er" and "overriding... instinct" repeat closely. Adjective stacking ("muted sunlight," "coral-encrusted arches") slows momentum without adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    The text is severely compromised by the overuse of specific keywords ("repose" ×8, "copperlight" ×7, "hush" ×9, "sustain" ×6). This extreme repetition creates a distracting lexical loop that acts as a prose artifact, stalling momentum and obscuring the imagery behind a wall of redundant abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("winter-cracked fields," "resonant awakening," "mournful elation") triggers the loop/artifact penalty. These refrains occur too frequently for the short word count, creating a scaffolded, template-like cadence that obstructs flow.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and adjective stacking ("fragile bloom in the desolation," "gossamer threads"). There are repetitive phrasing artifacts ("orchid solace—soft purple solace") and a reliance on abstract metaphors that blur the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from extreme artifacting: "Warmly curious" appears four times, and "cautious enchantment" (or variations) five times, often as sentence openers. This heavy reliance on repetitive phrasing to meet prompt requirements creates a stuttering, template-like rhythm that obscures line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive modification and cliché ("dew-kissed," "poignant ache," "symphony of soft whirs"). Several sentences function as structural scaffolding or prompt-patching ("She was carefully inventive," "Her motivation pulsed deep"), reducing narrative momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts, including the tautology "eternal candle flickered eternally" and the overuse of phrases like "echoed silence" (3x), "adjacent possibilities" (4x), and "unheard stories" (4x) in a short space. These lexical loops and redundancies stall momentum and signal a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.2)
    The text suffers severely from repetitive phrasing; the specific phrase "fierce tenderness" (or variants) appears six times in a short space, creating a robotic, templated rhythm. Metaphors are often mixed or strained ("tugged at unspoken regrets like vines claiming forgotten shores"). These artifacts disrupt flow and signal a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=2.5)
    Execution is marred by a significant grammatical error ("Elara gently unknot the frayed string") and pervasive overwriting. The density of mixed metaphors ("reefs exploding like minds") and modifier-heavy phrasing stifles narrative momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition artifacts undermine the prose; the specific phrase "pensive mirth" appears five times (with variations appearing ~10 times total), and "exposed film" loops excessively. Overwrought adjectives ("vivid," "quiet," "slender") clutter sentences and reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    The text suffers from awkward grammatical constructions to accommodate the required phrase ("fingers dancing methodically playful") and heavy reliance on adjectives ("dew-kissed," "overripe"). The prose leans purple, with metaphors that blur clarity ("sculpted sonic sculptures," "prismatic reflections").

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive artifacts significantly harm the prose quality. The word "warp/warped" appears over a dozen times, and phrases like "chaos converged" and "candidly cryptic" loop repetitively, creating a template cadence. This lexical redundancy flattens the momentum and obscures the action under abstract labels.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers significantly from "adjective-itis" and "purple prose," with nearly every noun modified by a grandiose adjective. There are severe repetition loops (e.g., "reef-shadow joy" and "shyly unstoppable" repeated ad nauseam), creating a drag on rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "gently systematic" appears three times, and "ignited the action" is a jarring, meta-textual clunker. The relentless "adjective-noun" pairing creates a dense, sluggish rhythm, and the literalization of the tone prompt into "foxglove tears" strains credulity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacting damages flow; "cautious exuberance" appears four times, and "glass ink well" appears five times in a short text. This "synonym churn" failure creates a robotic, checklist cadence that prevents the prose from achieving density or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.2)
    Lexical repetition is severe and distracting, with "dappled" appearing seven times and "sly/slyly" five times, creating a loop artifact. The prose relies heavily on filtering and summary ("Murmurs rose," "truth sank in") rather than concrete action during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers significantly from keyword stuffing, with variations of "bloom" and "wither" appearing over a dozen times, creating a mechanical, repetitive cadence that distracts from the narrative. The writing leans into purple prose ("cosmic voids," "ethereal," "husk of his heart") rather than precise, active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe lexical repetition mars the prose; "intuit/intuition" appears six times as a narrative crutch, and words like "hush," "sacred," and "distance" loop frequently within a short word count. These artifacts, combined with reliance on filter verbs ("she intuited," "she felt"), significantly lower the technical execution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.9)
    Physical logic breaks in the first paragraph (buoyancy and pressure rules regarding the fractured dome and submersible) undermine credibility. Repetitive phrasing of prompt elements acts as a prose artifact that draws attention to the writing rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from severe simile churn (using "like" or "as" roughly every few sentences) and adjective stacking ("frail tendril," "verdant emotion-ink"). This ornamental density creates a drag on momentum and obscures the action behind a layer of "purple" description.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose quality is severely hampered by the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("serenade the monotony," "lightly attentive," "calculated wilderness") across multiple paragraphs. The writing is frequently overwritten with adjective-heavy descriptions that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is cluttered with excessive modifiers ("dew-kissed," "liquid starfire") and relies on "spontaneously" to drive plot turns, a significant craft failure. High adjective density obscures the action and slows narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetitive phrasing (scaffold loops) creates drag; "reading between the lines" and "noctilucent" appear three times each, often awkwardly inserted. The prose is dense with adjectives and filter verbs ("he felt," "he saw") that dilute immediacy. The integration of required phrases is jarring and mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetitive artifacts degrade the prose: "hard softness" appears three times, "celestial dance/bodies" three times, and "gently skilled" twice. Purple prose ("voice cracking like the box") often muddles the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("serene upheaval" x4, "revitalize" x4) creates a looping artifact. The prose is overwritten with abstract metaphors that obscure physical cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.0)
    The score is heavily impacted by the repetitive, mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. "Sensitively perceptive" appears three times, often with awkward grammar ("moved sensitively perceptive to," "sifted... sensitively perceptive to"), and "ivy-veiled passage" appears three times. These act as significant text artifacts that break the prose's flow and create a "checklist" feel, despite the otherwise lush description.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is severely marred by the forced repetition of specific phrases ("perceptively calm" appears four times; "dusky harmony" three times). This creates a robotic, template-like cadence. The writing is overwritten with adjective-heavy clichés ("rain-kissed stone," "transcendent grace") that clutter the sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.2)
    Egregious repetition of specific phrases ("operatively gentle" x4, "flawed beauty" x3) fractures the prose flow and triggers a heavy artifact penalty, especially at the closure. The style is overwritten and prone to cliché, prioritizing ornamentation over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant overwriting and repetitive artifacts hinder quality; the phrase "fractured grace" appears twice, alongside "fractured expanse," "fractured beauty," and "quiet fracture." Metaphors are often mixed or melodramatic ("womb of desolation"), and adjective stacking reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=2.9)
    Line-level craft suffers from excessive "purple prose" and incoherent metaphors ("hips swaying in haiku rhythm," "arms arcing like sonnets") that obscure visualization. Severe repetitive phrasing loops (phrase "bodily poetic" used ~6 times) stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetitive loops damage the prose; specific phrases ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies," "uncommonly serene") appear 4–5 times each in a short space. This creates a "template cadence" artifact that destroys immersion and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=2.9)
    Line-level craft is severely damaged by text artifacts: "transiently rooted" is used seven times and "blushing stillness" four times in a short space, creating a distracting scaffold. The prose leans into purple descriptions ("iridesced purple promises") that obscure rather than reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.5)
    Line-level craft suffers significantly from the repetitive, forced usage of prompt terms; "snowmelt ardor" appears four times and "technically gentle" three times, often in grammatically or logically strained ways (e.g., "technically gentle radiance"). These artifacts break immersion and create a template-like cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is marred by extreme repetition of prompt phrases ("precisely playful" appears ~8 times; "ethereal grit" ~5 times), creating a template-cadence effect that halts momentum. These artifacts function as scaffolding rather than integrated description, creating a pervasive "synonym churn" issue.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is cluttered with repetitive diction artifacts that act as scaffolds ("empirically ironic" x3, "reimagined" x3, "dusky" x4, "frugal/thrifty" ~7). These repetitions distract from the narrative flow and feel like forced insertions of keywords rather than natural description. The density of adjectives slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from severe lexical repetition, with words like "shifting/shifted" (10+ times), "resentment" (9 times), "grace" (6 times), and "cellular" (5 times) creating a distracting loop. The reliance on abstract nouns and explanatory phrases ("conveying the conviction," "archived whispers") reduces density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from high adjective density and occasional overwriting ("ethereal haze," "crystalline spines," "fragile dance"). While the imagery is often beautiful ("frost-kissed rot"), the reliance on metaphor stacks in the description of the glass mountains creates a slight drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is marred by purple phrasing ("shadowed husk," "yawning doors") and keyword stuffing. The prompt terms ("persist," "endearingly feisty") are repeated verbatim multiple times, creating a mechanical rhythm that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts penalize this score; the phrases "simply complicated" and "brightened disquiet" each appear five times, creating distracting lexical loops. The prose leans heavily on abstract nouns and purple descriptors ("spectral hum," "iridescent soil") that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=1.8)
    The text contains disqualifying artifacts ("But wait, trim back...", "[Word check internal.]") and severe repetition of phrases like "carefully resourceful" and "unheard symphony." These flaws indicate a lack of basic revision and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.5)
    The text is severely marred by the repetitive looping of distinct phrases (e.g., "unkindled solace" and "blissfully aberrant" both appear four times). This creates a checklist effect and structural monotony ("Memories altered...") that disrupts flow and immediately disqualifies the prose from high-band consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive labeling ("adaptability shone," "adaptability surged," "warmly methodical" used twice verbatim) and abstract subject-verb constructions. The meta-text at the end ("recalibrating... 792 words") constitutes a severe text artifact that disqualifies the piece from literary immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.1)
    While grammatically sound, the prose suffers from significant text loops and "purple" overwriting. The quadruple repetition of "hammered repose" and overuse of "luminous" create a distracting template cadence that signals a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("thistle-blown" appears three times) and adjective-heavy "scaffold" descriptions ("fractured visions that bloomed unbidden"). The recurrence of the prompt phrase feels forced rather than rhythmic, and the density of figurative language often obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts dominate the prose: the phrase "preemptively nostalgic" appears six times, "conjecture" six times, and "deepening hush" four times in a short text. These loops create a mechanical template cadence that distracts from the story and reads like forced keyword insertion. The prose density is low due to this synonym churn and reliance on abstract labels.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by repetitive word choice ("bloom/blooming" and "hush" appear frequently) and clunky integration of prompt phrases ("Through this method of ambient awareness"). These artifacts create a stuttering rhythm and highlight the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.7)
    Prose is overwrought with dense, mixed metaphors ("voice cracking like shells," "fragmented skies trapped in eternity," "viscous in hesitation"). Specific prompt phrases ("warmly observant," "tangential approach") are inserted awkwardly as literal text artifacts, disrupting the sentence rhythm. The density of figurative language obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the descriptive prose is generally strong, the text suffers from significant repetitive artifacts ("intangibly tangible" x3, "stretching contracted" variations x4). These repeated phrases feel forced and mechanical, creating a stuttering effect that detracts from the otherwise polished line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetitive looping of mandatory phrases ("fluidly logical" and "vaulting hush" each appear four times) creates distracting text artifacts. These insertions often result in grammatical awkwardness ("approached fluidly logical") that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is overwritten and modifier-heavy ("smog-veiled," "liquid veil," "latent Elder energy"), slowing momentum. The direct insertion of the prompt phrase "wisely adventurous" as an adjective-adverb combination is clunky and disrupts the line-level rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant deduction for scaffold loops and repetitive phrasing; full titles and phrases like "tender shadow keeper" (4x), "loaded emptiness" (3x), and "linking through scars" (3x) appear as pasted artifacts. The density of abstract adjectives ("suffocating desperation," "writhed") slows momentum without adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe text-artifact penalties apply due to the looping repetition of specific phrases: "shadowseam wonder" (4x), "virtuously mischievous" (3x), and "quantum promise" (3x) appear verbatim, creating a robotic cadence. These artifacts persist through the closure beat, significantly obscuring the prose's natural flow and density.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.5)
    Prose quality is severely damaged by the redundant looping of prompt phrases ("golden shadows," "bridge of intuition") and purple constructions ("trumpet of fate"). The text fails the read-aloud test due to these artifacts, creating a stuttering, "mad libs" effect that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive artifact loops; "factually mystical," "shivering bliss," "endless night," and "withdrawn" are each repeated 3–4 times in a short space, creating a mechanical stutter. The "factually mystical" phrasing is a register error that clashes with the fantasy context, and the text is clogged with purple modifiers ("molten glass," "ethereal sap") that obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but prone to sentimental clichés like "weary sentinels," "spirit lifted," and "tapestry of resilience" that soften the impact. The repetition of specific phrases ("tactfully hopeful," "dust patterns") creates a scaffold effect that draws attention to the writing process rather than the story world.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weighed down by adjective stuffing and mixed metaphors ("fingering the tarnished phone booth key... edges worn smooth by years of quiet defiance"). High-density modifiers ("ethereal gold," "velvet sky," "prismatic signals") clutter the sentences, and filter verbs ("Elias knew better") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("quietly vivid" x5, "vested hush" x4, "eerie nostalgia" x4) creates a "checklist" texture that destroys prose immersion. Additionally, syntactic looping is pervasive, with "Dewdrops" serving as the subject for nearly ten clauses, often repetitively starting sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=2.8)
    The phrase "mossy delight" is repeated five times in a short space, becoming a distraction that highlights a lack of lexical variety. Adjective stacking ("colossal branches," "ancient fingers," "perpetual gray veils") slows the rhythm and clutters the prose. The writing draws attention to itself at the expense of clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.3)
    Contains a significant credibility error ("forged... quartz") that breaks physical plausibility. Repetitive use of the root words "certain/uncertain" and "improvise" creates a dulling echo. Similes are occasionally heavy-handed ("like omens") and slow the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive tagging ("luminous regret" appears three times) and mixed metaphors (polishing rust into mirrors via rain). Required phrases like "factually mystical" are pasted in without syntactic blending, creating noticeable artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe text-artifacting is present. The phrases "modestly fearless" and "luminous ache" are each repeated four times within a short text, creating a distraction that mimics a checklist rather than organic prose. The density of "thesaurus-itis" (e.g., "veiled light," "spectral confessions") obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition of prompt terms creates a "checklist" texture ("ultraviolet" appears ~9 times, "proprioception/proprioceptively" ~6 times in a short space). The opening line ("ebbed like a receding tide") is a cliché that weakens the hook.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, with nearly every noun modified by an adjective ("vaporous lanterns," "indifferent cliffs," "bubbling retorts"), creating drag and reducing impact. The repetition of prompt phrases ("elusively tangible," "anchor of intuition") feels mechanical and disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is functional and clear but marred by abstract metaphors ("distant popcorn dreams") and tell-heavy phrasing ("skillfully observant"). The rhythm is steady, but the reliance on adjectives to carry atmosphere slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.8)
    A critical syntax failure occurs in the climax: "The library destabilizes perfect systems convulsed" reads as a corrupted sentence where the prompt phrase was pasted blindly, breaking the narrative flow. The ending dissolves into a telegraphic "Subject Verb" cadence ("Clouds swirled... Reality bent... Patterns reformed") that feels like a stylistic affectation rather than a controlled rhythmic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and lexical repetition; the word "burnished" appears four times and "gilded" twice in a short space. Heavy adjectival modification ("frozen screams," "fractured violet sprays") clutters the imagery and hampers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with abstract metaphors and compound modifiers ("tinkersong wonder," "soul-spring," "covenant of rust"). The phrase "wept tinkersong tears" in the climax acts as a significant artifact, mixing metaphor with cliché in a way that disrupts the emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe prose artifacts are present: "resonant hush" appears 7 times, "hinged" variations over 8 times, and "sensibly eccentric" 5 times. These repetition loops function as scaffolding that obscures the story's flow and creates a drudgery of reading. The prose lacks variation and relies on these stock phrases as crutches.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("turbine-hum" x6, "perpetually learning" x5) creates a jarring, mechanical cadence that mimics generation artifacts. The prose suffers from synonym churn and purple abstraction ("digital heartbeat," "fractal veins") that obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.4)
    Significant deduction for repetitive artifacting of prompt phrases ("umbral tenderness," "reckon," "quietly driven" each appear multiple times). The prose suffers from dense adjectival stacking and filter verbs ("she found," "she understood") that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and overwriting; "searing" appears four times, alongside "solemn/solemnity" and "tension." The reliance on purple phrasing ("retrocognitively," "clutch of revelation," "fragile vigil") and adjective-noun pairings creates density that obstructs momentum and feels stylized rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies and stock phrasing ("forgotten prayers," "sweat beaded his brow"). Metaphors are occasionally mixed or clunky ("uncorked his mind like a volatile elixir"). The density of adjectives slows the pacing without adding necessary specificity, creating a textural heaviness that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant line-level flaws present. The phrase "velvet disquiet" is used as a noun phrase and echoes "velvet-cushioned" and "velvet drag" (four uses of "velvet"). A serious tautological error occurs in "dissolving like dissolving oaths."

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is overwritten, suffering from excessive adjectival stacking ("honeyed fog," "verdant frenzy") and repetitive oxymoronic structures ("furious tranquility," "calm rage," "serene fury"). The integration of the phrase "by decreasing entropy" as a chanted method is jarringly literal and clunky.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition of static phrases ("windblown sanctuary," "solstice hush," "zero hour") creates a mechanical, looping rhythm. The prose suffers from adjective stuffing and "telling," with no distinct texture or lexical control to vary the density.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from high-density metaphorical overwriting ("tears tracing cheeks like miniature comets," "vein of liquid sunlight"), which obscures clarity. The frequent use of abstract nouns and adjectives creates a "purple" texture that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose quality is severely hampered by the repetitive, forced use of prompt phrases ("tranquilly perceptive" x4, "contextual clues" x3, "mute eloquence" x3). This repetition, combined with adverb-heavy "tell" sentences ("tranquilly perceived the ritual's shape"), creates significant drag and artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is marred by forced insertions of prompt phrases ("suddenly timeless," "anticipated mysteries") which disrupt the rhythm. Additionally, the text is overwritten with adjective stacking and heavy similes ("groaning like a reluctant oracle"), reducing narrative momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is marred by severe looping and keyword stuffing. "Warmly attentive" appears four times and "burnished hush" three times, triggering significant text-artifact penalties. The writing relies on adjective-heavy telling ("quiet poet's soul," "discord incarnate") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("brazen calm" appears five times; "gently systematic" three times), creating a mechanical rhythm. Much of the narrative is abstract telling ("fostering interspecies respect") rather than concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.0)
    Purple prose creates opacity (e.g., "luminous skepticism cast a soft glow on her face" awkwardly literalizes an abstract emotion). Frequent adjective stacking, mixed metaphors ("petals clung like forgotten whispers"), and the repetition of "bronze" and "luminous" clutter the line-level execution and stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetition harms the prose rhythm; "blooming" is used five times and the phrase "narrow vastness" four times, creating a stuttering effect. Some descriptions lean toward purple prose ("desperate finger tracing infinity") that obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe artifact penalties apply for the repetition of "wild hush" (~11 times) and "intuitively descriptive" (~4 times) in awkward syntactic slots. These loops damage prose rhythm and coherence, creating mixed metaphors ("lantern's wild hush flicker") that obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose, with "echoed silence" appearing six times and "temporally stretched" six times in a short space. The line "Word count pulsed to finality" is a fatal artifact that breaks diegesis. The rhythm is monotonous, often relying on adjective-noun pairings that feel algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally polished with evocative phrasing, though "heart pounding" is a cliché. The verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful") feels mechanical and draws attention to the construction rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("nomadic penumbra" ~5 variations, "luminous absence" x3, "benevolently ruthless" x2). These function as text artifacts, creating a checklist sensation that drags down the line-level density and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacting, specifically the overuse of prompt terms ("seed/seeded/seeding" appears ~5 times; "hidden thunder" appears 3 times). These repetitions feel mechanical and clutter the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    Imagery is often strong, but a glaring subject-verb agreement error ("fingers fidgets") in the first paragraph undermines the craft. The repetition of forced prompt phrases and dense metaphorical scaffolding occasionally obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition artifacts mar the prose; the specific phrase "innocently mischievous" appears four times, and "forged hush" twice, creating a loop effect. The density of adjectives and "purple" descriptors ("silken hook," "bruised sky") slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetitive usage of the words "quilting" (~12 times) and "narrating" (~6 times) creates a distracting textual artifact that bludgeons the metaphor. Abstract nouns ("luminous intent," "golden resolve") clutter the sentences, obscuring concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from adjective stacking, mixed metaphors, and "showy" modifiers that reduce clarity. Physical logic breaks at the end—a painted shell projecting holograms is a jarring unearned shift in the established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is riddled with clichés ("dawn cracked the sky," "pink fingers of dawn") and oxymorons that confuse rather than illuminate ("screaming tenderness"). Information density is low due to adjectival clutter, and the rhythm is repetitive. The recurring phrase "screaming tenderness" reads like an unintegrated prompt insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mechanically polished, but the prose suffers from metaphor density and repetitive thematic labeling ("loss's geography," "loss's atlas," "loss's threads"). The reliance on summary telling ("Elias worked through salt-stung nights") saps narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Significant repetition of prompt phrases ("fractured grace" and "psychological safety" each appear three times) creates a noticeable scaffold/loop effect. Adjective stacking ("sheer, storm-battered," "fractured and exquisite") slows momentum and reduces prose density.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=3.5)
    The phrase "softly persistent" acts as a severe text artifact, appearing six times in a short story (lines 2, 16, 23, 36, 44, 49). This repetition creates a distracting drone that breaks immersion. Additionally, the prose suffers from metaphor density ("lantern swinging like a hesitant heartbeat") and mechanical listing ("Gap one... Gap two") that disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is competent but suffers from adjective stacking and cliché ("cartographic ghosts," "tattered atlas"). The repetition of the clumsy phrase "empirically intuitive" three times, including at the emotional climax, disrupts the flow and acts as a scaffold rather than genuine description.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant overwriting and adjectivitis clutter the prose ("bleeding starlight," "luminous ichor," "ethereal beauty"). The score is heavily impacted by the repetition of prompt phrases ("softly commanding" x3, "lacy menace" x3) which act as visible text artifacts, breaking the flow and reducing lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of prompt phrases ("scientifically romantic" x3, "revalue" x6, "directed spontaneity" x4) inserted verbatim as clumsy labels. Over-modified noun phrases ("sanguine determination," "liquid convictions") create significant drag and opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant overwriting and metaphor density impede clarity (e.g., "clinging... like an old regret," "virgin veins"). Almost every noun carries a modifier, creating a sluggish rhythm and obscuring the action under layers of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is overwritten with tautological similes ("scratches like frantic scratches") and repetitive adjectival stacking ("perfect hush," "trembling calm"). The inclusion of non-narrative drafting artifacts in the final lines ("Wait, no—system counts only narrative words") is a fatal flaw that renders the text unpublishable. Phrasing often prioritizes poetic sound over clarity and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like drawn curtains," "like manacles," "like fireflies," "like talismans") which act as artifacts cluttering the imagery. Phrasing often prioritizes ornamentation over propulsion, slowing the reading speed during critical beats.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lexical repetition undermines the craft; "grit" appears five times and "currents" six times in a short space, creating a distracting echo. The prose occasionally drifts into purple territory ("clawing at her ribs like a poltergeist"), obscuring clarity with density.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("resounding hush" x6, "wanderingly exact" x4, "universe's hiccup" x5) creates a looping artifact that dominates the prose. This mechanical recycling of language constitutes a major breakdown in line-level craft and readability.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of required phrases ("fjord quiet" appears 7 times; "eminently peculiar" 4 times; "razor edges" 5 times), creating a distracting scaffold loop. These artifacts flatten the sentence rhythm and draw attention to the writing process rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.4)
    The phrase "quiet wildfire" is repeated three times, acting as a repetitive scaffold. Phrasing is often overwrought ("clung-to threats," "invitation through the unseen"), reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("lucid contradiction" x5, "theoretically rebellious" x3, "clover-melancholy" x3) creates significant text artifacts. The prose relies on heavy adjective stacking and similes ("yellowed like old regrets") that feel decorative rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("shadows clung like forgotten secrets," "witching hours," "friendship bloomed") and generic summaries, diminishing the density and freshness required for the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.7)
    Fatal repetition artifacts render the prose unpublishable; "haunted euphoria" appears five times and "gently thorough" four times, reading like a glitch or checklist enforcement. The prose is overwritten with mixed metaphors and "thesaurus-itis," prioritizing ornamentation over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is functional but tends toward purple descriptors ("mischievous vines") and clichés at pivotal moments ("electric exchange," "voice cracking like dry leaves"), reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten, relying heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("gnarled bark," "silent symphonies," "celestial drift") and mixed metaphors ("tears... evaporating into the blaze"). The phrase "quiet blaze" is repeated four times in a short space, creating a distracting artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from "adjectivitis" and mixed metaphors ("unbent herself from regret's curve"). While there is some lovely imagery, the density of abstract figures ("viscous starlit fluid," "chaff of chaos") sometimes obscures the immediate physical action. The repetition of the prompt phrase "confidently uncertain" disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple" overwriting and relying on labels to convey emotion ("joyful sorrow," "forgotten heart"). Show-don't-tell failures abound, such as describing the advisor as "quietly charismatic" instead of demonstrating the trait through action.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of specific prompt phrases ("volcanic tenderness" x3, "analytically intuitive" x2, "portray" x4) creates distracting text artifacts that disrupt rhythm and immersion, particularly at the closure beat. The prose leans into cliché ("lava kissing the sea," "entwined like roots") and high adjective density, stifling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is severely overwritten, with a high density of adjectives and mixed metaphors ("vibrations bloomed," "spectral arms," "memory shards") that clog the pacing. "Auroral sorrow" appears multiple times as a crutch phrase, and the reliance on abstract imagery prevents visceral engagement with the action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("groaning under the geomagnetic storm's fury"). "Calculated spontaneity" is a jarring oxymoron that feels inserted. The motivation is told ("Elias burned with a deeper motive") rather than dramatized through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is competent but laden with "purple" artifacts and abstract nouns ("oblivion," "tranquility," "unrest") that blur specificity. The prompt-mandated phrase "spiralingly calm" is grammatically awkward and disrupts the rhythm, while repetitive phrasing ("edge of a half-spoken secret") acts as a clumsy refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("mist... clung like forgotten regrets") and abstractions that obscure the action. Repetitive phrasing of prompt elements ("amplified quiet," "unspoken words") creates a mechanical rhythm, and the overuse of adjectives stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is overwritten with adjectival clutter ("lithe body," "salt-crusted fish," "moonlit ivory"). A significant repetitive loop occurs with the phrase "combative tenderness," which appears as a label rather than being evoked through interaction, stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("shavings curling like pale whispers"). However, there is a tendency toward "purple" modifiers and heavy metaphors ("indifferent as rain"). Some expositional phrasing ("motivation burned beneath the void") interrupts the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from density issues and repetitive phrasing ("paraphrase" used five times as a verb; "lantern-moth" repeated as a motif). Abstract noun-heavy descriptions ("oldest silences," "quartz essence") create opacity. The "tremor of certainty" is a "tell" that replaces the dramatization of confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.1)
    The phrase "innocently cunning" (and its variation "cunning innocence") appears four times in a short space, creating a severe repetitive artifact that creates a scaffolded feel. Additionally, phrases like "bartered awakenings" repeat often enough to dull their impact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose quality: "golden shadows" (5x), "propelled" (5x), and "powerfully gentle" (4x) create a mechanical, algorithmic cadence. Adjective density is high ("languid," "filigreed," "spectral," "prismatic"), resulting in purple prose that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from adjectival clutter and keyword repetition ("ardor" appears four times; "bloom/withering" recur frequently). The prompt-mandated phrase "genuinely artificial" is inserted as a jarring oxymoron, and the density of modifiers slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive loops and "text artifacts" (e.g., "steadily curious" appears five times; "inherited mystery" four times; "rain-beaded" three times). This repetition suggests a checklist approach rather than organic craft, creating a stilted, mechanical rhythm. Adjective stuffing ("mosaic of liquid jewels," "post-crash world") creates purple prose that obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("steadily unpredictable" x4, "anguished joy" x3, "end of innocence" x4) creates a scaffolded, artificial rhythm. High density of abstract "noun of noun" constructions ("vaults of the lost civilization," "veil of history's lies") clutters the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by excessive adjective clutter and repetitive word choice; variations of "luminous" appear seven times, and "bloom" appears frequently, creating a monotone texture. The recurring usage of "softly deliberate" is grammatically awkward and creates a distracting text artifact that pulls the reader out of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose suffers from adjective clutter ("ethereal calm," "infinite patience") and significant repetitive phrasing ("quietly vivid" used 5 times). Clichés obscure the specific reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwrought phrasing and "showy" descriptions that distance the reader. Phrases like "fingers bled into the earth" clash with the established setting of a stone tower floor, creating friction between the line-level imagery and the narrative facts.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is often dense with purple descriptors ("midwifed revelation," "shadowed aerie"). The repetition of "incubating" (used four times in short succession) feels mechanical and forced, particularly within the dialogue. Phrasing like "Spatially imaginative, Elara..." is clunky expository shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and "purple" tendencies ("shadowed rapture," "spectral embrace," "silent symphonies"). High density of adjective-noun pairings and abstract metaphors ("pierced her mind like distant radio waves") creates a melodramatic texture that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with dense personification in nearly every sentence ("petals sigh," "boots whispering," "wind's thieving fingers"), obscuring clarity. Significant penalty applied for excessive looping of keywords: "hush" (5x), "fractured" (5x), "lullaby" (5x), "bloom" (6x), and "occasionally everywhere" (4x). This repetition creates a droning artifact effect rather than purposeful rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is adjective-dense and prone to repetition, with the phrase "probable miracles" appearing three times in a short span, dulling its impact. Adverbs like "improbably" prop up descriptions that should stand on their own image-work. The density of compound nouns ("willowire," "ashforge") creates texture but occasionally slows the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is marred by excessive repetition of key terms ("lullaby," "vigil," "leash," "traverse") and "purple" descriptors ("shimmering essence," "voices weaving like kelp"). "Gently persistent" is inserted as a clumsy tag. The density of abstract metaphors obscures the physical action and results in a "scaffold" effect where the machinery of the writing is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and "purple" descriptors ("seraphically mundane," "cobalt womb," "confession untold"). Mixed metaphors ("eyes welled, not tears but frost") and heavy adjectival clutter obscure the action and reduce narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose flow is competent, but the text relies on repetitive descriptors ("constellations," "drift") and oxymoronic labels ("regally unpretentious") that tell rather than show. The "simplespun" compound feels like a genre artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.9)
    Line-level craft is marred by repetitive "checklist" phrasing ("Drifting moored" x2, "periodically eternal" x3) that creates a stuttering rhythm. Additionally, there is a significant logic gap in the prose where physical tapping is described as "encoding regeneration data," a functional mismatch that reads as a shortcut rather than a plausible interaction with the technology.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe artifacting and looping; specific phrases ("thunderous serenity," "awkwardly confident," "barefoot") are repeated 3–6 times each in a short space, creating a jarring, robotic rhythm. The prose is overwritten ("bruised skies bled") and relies on telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("breath caught," "pulsing like a heartbeat") and filter verbs ("heard," "revealing visions"). Information is frequently conveyed through summary rather than scene, particularly regarding the plant telepathy and the history of the embryo. The density of adjectives slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from scaffold repetition ("pearl of stillness" appears three times) and adjective-heavy styling. The integration of required phrases is jarring, particularly the use of clinical terms in poetic contexts, creating a tonal clash.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=2.9)
    Significant craft issues mar the prose, notably the redundant and awkward dialogue tags ("muttered rhetorically," "whispered, the rhetorical question hanging"). The text relies on excessive similes ("like accusations," "like shards," "like phosphorescent waves," "like mournful fireflies") that clutter the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases—"serene anger" appears five times and "consciously wild" four times—creates a mechanical, distracting rhythm. Adjective stacking ("deliberate feral grace") and synonym churn ("viscous ink," "ethereal sheen") clog the sentence flow and obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant penalties for text artifacts and repetitive phrasing. Specific phrases—"dizzying quiet" (4x), "bravely conflicted" (3x), "scandalize" (3x), "contraband truths" (4x)—are looped to the point of distraction, breaking the narrative flow. The prose feels mechanically assembled around these required terms rather than organically written.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers significantly from keyword stuffing; "inculcating" appears four times, dragging the rhythm, and "senselessly perceptive" becomes a repetitive tic. The reliance on oxymorons ("tranquil blaze," "serene inferno") and abstract nouns creates a dense, overwrought style that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from high density and repetitive diction ("zigzagging," "transliterating," "feral," "echo" appear frequently in short succession). Overwritten descriptions ("transliterated terror," "shimmering scripts") stall momentum, and the heavy use of adjective-noun pairs creates a rhythmic monotony that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases creates a mechanical texture; "orbits of regret" (5x), "rosewood pen nib" (4x), and "solemn playfulness" (3x) act as scaffolding artifacts. This redundancy stalls momentum and makes the prose feel algorithmic rather than crafted.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with dense metaphor stacks ("history's throat," "guilt's orchestra," "ghost of wings straining"). While rhythmic, the high density of figurative language sometimes draws attention to the writing rather than the scene, and "ink that smelled of fresh rain" strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from repetitive labeling ("socially perceptive" used twice as a tag) and abstract noun phrases ("lilac unease") that clog the rhythm. Momentum is dragged down by filtering verbs and telling ("sensed the undercurrents," "discerned the core concept") instead of showing action.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("arms of steel" appears three times) and awkward adverbial constructions ("retrocognitively"). The density of abstract adjectives and "thesaurus" word choices obstructs clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and redundancy ("verdant greens," "synesthetically blessed curse"). The density of adjectives and "purple" descriptions ("visuals hummed in velvet applause") obscures clarity and slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases damages the prose quality; &quot;fractally precise&quot; appears five times and &quot;willowglass hope&quot; four times in under 700 words, creating a robotic cadence. These artifacts distract significantly from otherwise functional descriptions and pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    The phrase "factually mystical" is repeated three times as a clumsy adjective phrase, creating a jarring artifact. Prose leans purple ("gnawed at stone," "cave's humid breath") and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers severely from repetitive artifacting, specifically the phrase "quietly inspired," which appears five times, and "unearthed silence," which appears twice. These insertions break the narrative flow and read like a checklist being engaged. While the descriptive language is often lush, the mechanical repetition of these stems creates a stuttering, artificial rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.2)
    Line-level craft suffers significantly from the mechanical stuffing of prompt phrases, causing grammatical awkwardness (e.g., "Kneeling prudently daring"). The phrases "prudently daring" and "silver hush" each appear five times in a short space, creating a distractingly repetitive loop. This redundancy flattens the prose momentum and reads like a checklist rather than organic storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple" overwriting and mixed metaphors ("truth steeped like fog-brewed tea," "memories percolated"). Prompt phrases are inserted as whole "artifacts" rather than woven into the syntax, and the reliance on abstract nouns ("spindrift serenity," "crystalline peace") weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose relies heavily on adjectival clusters and stock phrases ("scorched wasteland," "forgotten sins," "merciless sky," "velvet hush"). These clichés dull the imagery and reduce specificity. The density of modifiers ("sharp gentleness," "quiet defiance") slows momentum without adding informational value.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from a high density of "like [noun]" similes ("like spilled mercury," "like fallen stars," "like oil slicks") and adjective-noun stacking. This ornamental approach creates a barrier to immediacy, prioritizing decorative language over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe prose artifacts are present due to the forced, repetitive insertion of required phrases (loops of "brittle awakenings" and "by the hum..."). These repetitions act as scaffold rather than motif, stalling momentum. The prose is often overwritten and abstract ("fragile realizations that cracked open like thin ice"), lacking concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe lexical redundancy destroys immersion; the word "prismatic" appears six times and the phrase "inevitably whimsical" four times. Purple prose ("liquid light," "healing sky") obscures clarity and creates a melodramatic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers significantly from severe repetition artifacts. The exact phrase "cautiously hopeful" appears six times, and "ethereal grit" four times, creating a distracting drumbeat that ruins the rhythm and flow. These loops obscure the craft and distract from an otherwise competent sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition of specific descriptors constitutes a major text artifact. The root word "wistful" appears seven times, "rebel/rebellion" six times, and "prudent" four times in a short space, creating a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm that disrupts the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "furrowed hush" appears four times in a short space, becoming a distraction. Metaphors are mixed and often confusing ("empathy uncoiling like mist burned by dawn"), and the reliance on abstract nouns creates a dense, opaque texture that impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe artifacting is present: "spongey dread" (5x), "nervously confident" (4x), and "reversible exile" (4x) create a distracting template cadence. The prose suffers from overwriting ("pulse a nervous tattoo," "idealism unsponged") and logic breaks in metaphors, such as a "voice a defiant thread" in "muffling dread."

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe lexical loops and adjective stuffing mar the prose; "luminous" appears six times and "disbelief" five times, creating a monotonous texture. The phrase "pixelated amnesty" is shoehorned in, and the text suffers from purple descriptors ("spectral wings," "forgiving dots") that clutter the sentences and impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive strain damages the prose; specific phrases like "perceptively calm," "dusky harmony," and "dissuaded" appear multiple times, acting as scaffold artifacts. The writing relies heavily on "telling" via summary and abstract nouns rather than concrete action, resulting in a dense but static texture.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe keyword repetition creates a distractingly monotonic rhythm; the word "solace" appears seven times and "burden" five times in a short space. The prose relies on abstract nouns and adjectival padding ("unyielding motivation," "ethereal sweat") rather than strong verbs, creating a "text artifact" loop that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of root words and phrases; "serene" or "serenity" appears eight times, and the specific phrase "warlike serenity" is used three times in a short text. This redundant phrasing, alongside clichés like "frost-kissed" and "acidic relish," distracts significantly from the narrative flow and indicates a lack of lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant penalties apply for text artifacts and looping; the phrase "anxious elation" appears five times, including at closure, and "purposefully curious" appears three times. These repetitions act as scaffolding that displaces genuine description and halts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive forcing of prompt phrases; "fiercely gentle" appears four times in a short text, and "inlaying meaning" and "trammel" are similarly overused. This mechanical keyword stuffing creates a jarring rhythm and exposes the scaffolding of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story opens with a notorious creative writing cliché ("Dust motes danced..."), which immediately lowers the literary ceiling. The required verb "wrest" is repeated three times in quick succession, creating a distracting lexical loop. The prose is functional but marred by these artifacts and occasional purple phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is competent but often purple and adjective-dense ("colossal tree," "spectral gaze," "latent wisdom"). There is a tendency toward metaphor muddle ("ambitions seeded in every bite," "flavor" encoding physics). The rhythm is somewhat monotonous, lacking variation to match the shifting tension of the arbor's instability.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.9)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose relies on dense adjectival stacking and abstract metaphors ("warrior hearts cloaked in poet's sighs") that obscure clarity. Phrasing often favors decorative alliteration and poetic abstraction over concrete, active description.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("acquired abandoned hopes" x4, "heartbeat" x4, "hush" x7) creates a mechanical, looping rhythm. Sentences like "Via confessions... it had acquired abandoned hopes" are syntactically awkward scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prompt elements are shoehorned in, causing repetitive and awkward phrasing ("notes alluded to," "sketch alluded to," "music alluded to," "blurred as he alluded"). The prose suffers from adjective stacking ("serpentine whispers," "frantic crisscrosses") and melodrama ("strangled," "shattered," "desperate layers"). "Raw solace" is repeated three times, and "methodical" five times, creating a jarring echo.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=2.7)
    Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose; variations of "cautious exuberance" appear five times, creating a distraction that feels like a prompt insertion rather than organic tone. The writing is dense with adjectives and adverbs that clutter the sentences without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.6)
    Severe repetition artifacts undermine the prose quality: "mulberry ache" appears five times, "propagate" seven times, and "velvet" four times in a short space. These text loops, combined with overwrought metaphor ("coffee stains... forming jagged rips"), create a clutter that obscures the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and "purple" artifacts, with dense adjective stacking ("fine needle of frozen dew," "alabaster slab") that slows momentum. Metaphors occasionally mix or confuse ("distant thunder trapped in crystal birthing random flecks"), obscuring the physical action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.2)
    Line-level craft suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("kindly decisive" x3, "vineyard hush" x4) and syntactic wrecks ("action of scallop," "timeframe of after"). These artifacts destroy rhythm and signal a lack of integration.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is marred by significant repetition of prompt phrases ("sincerely insincere" appears four times as a tag) and abstract noun-heavy constructions ("vulnerability bloomed protected"). The high density of "telling" adjectives and the recycling of sentence stems create a stilted, artificial cadence. The writing draws attention to its own contrivance rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive. Images like "ancient, yellowed parchment set in the visage of a boy" and "groan of displaced air" do heavy lifting efficiently. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks disrupt the momentum. The description of the interference pattern is technically precise yet narratively driving.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant repetitive artifacting mars the prose; "weathered resolve" appears three times, "historically reverent" three times, and "wandering pulse" four times. These act as scaffolding rather than organic description. The text also suffers from adjective-noun overload that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is generally functional but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("brilliant dimness," "accommodated," "underachieving") and occasional clunky modifiers like "underachieving fingers." The phrase "ozone and ozone-tinged" creates a redundancy loop that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive looping of prompt phrases ("meteor hush" x4, "wandering purposefully" x2, "signifying/signified" x3) which act as scaffolding artifacts. Telling overrides showing in pivotal moments, and the density of adjectives ("sodden tomes," "ethereal script," "luminous vows") clogs the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from "text artifacts" and repetitive loops. Key phrases ("amber/ambered" x5, "stellar doubt" x5, "quietly enthusiastic/quiet enthusiasm" x4) are repeated verbatim, often as crutches to bridge scenes. This creates a drumbeat of redundancy that stalls momentum and obscures the line-level logic. The "distilling" metaphor is mixed with "wavelengths" and "static," creating figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("eyes like void pits") and telling ("motivation burned deep"). The verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("distant intimacy," "motivation fulfilled") creates jarring artifacts that break narrative momentum and style consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is cluttered with modifiers and suffers from significant repetitive artifacting (seven uses of "lukewarm," six of "naive"). These echoed labels act as scaffolding that obscures the action and creates a rhythmic drone, violating the standard for high-information density and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.4)
    The required phrase "precisely humane" is repeated four times as a static label, creating a distracting artifact that highlights the prompt mechanics. The prose leans heavily on abstract nouns and "tell" constructions ("His motivation burned steady"), preventing immediate immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=2.9)
    Prose is heavily overwritten with adjective clusters ("ancient freshness," "vaporous tendrils," "dew-kissed leaves") that stifle rhythm and immediacy. A significant textual artifact occurs with the clumsy insertion of the prompt phrase ("patterns through the patterns"), disrupting the sentence logic.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.6)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases triggers significant artifact penalties; "soundless echo" appears five times and "muscle memory" four times, creating distracting text loops. Phrasing is often tautological ("remembered through muscle memory") or overwritten ("static-free clarity," "soundless echo of the windless night").

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is often overwritten ("colossal slab," "pristine echo") and relies on abstract nouns performing physical actions. Several "and then" structures disguised by participial phrases weaken the sentence-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is laden with "purple" artifacts and mixed metaphors ("twilight bled," "roots threading like veins," "ingenuity's spark"). High-density adjective piling slows momentum without adding clarity ("soil-dusted paper," "storm-born silence"). The prompt phrase "notably receptive" is pasted in twice, disrupting flow and creating a repetitive artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    Line-level craft is marred by a severe patterned artifact: the phrase "mournfully eager" appears six times in under 500 words, including in the final paragraph. This repetition acts as a clumsy scaffold that dulls the prose and creates a loop effect.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is frequently abstract and repetitive ("fog/mist" and "interiorizing" appear often), with clunky phrasing like "method of interiorizing them" disrupting flow. Over-reliance on "tell" constructions ("It was no mere trinket," "I did this to...") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing ("approximation" used six times; "stoic" four times) creates a mechanical rhythm and scaffold-like feel. The prose leans into purple descriptions ("stifling script," "fractured vow") and clichés ("penny dropped") that dilute the clarity of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("moon bloated and close"), but there are slips like the redundant "Echo Gorge's gorge" and clunky phrasing ("orchestra tuning sans conductor's fuss"). The generation artifact at the end breaks immersion but was disregarded for the story's internal score.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from "telling" and awkward phrasing like "radioed salvation via patterns" and "static crackled like fracturing realities." Key phrases are repeated clumsily ("resiliently positive," "via interconnected patterns"), and the density of modifiers slows the rhythm without adding clarity. The writing draws attention to itself rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant deduction for phrase looping (Artifact Penalty). Key phrases like "unsettling calm" (4x), "realistically imaginary" (3x), and "rational enchantment" (4x) are repeated verbatim, reading like checklist insertions rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from a severe artifact at the ending (drafting notes included in the text) that disrupts the reading experience. Additionally, the phrase "somber marvel" repeats four times in a short space, creating a noticeable lexical loop that dulls the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases degrades the prose quality; "reeling hush" appears four times, and "persistently curious" three times, creating a robotic template cadence. These text artifacts and the purple prose style disrupt immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant text artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "crashing hush" is repeated four times and "unremembered" seven times, creating a distracting echo. These unvaried repetitions stall momentum and read as forced insertions rather than organic motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe line-level issues include a tautological editing error ("cleared after the radio static cleared") and nonsensical phrasing ("glitching into midnight solace tones"). The prose relies on abstraction ("Her attribute guided her") and repetitive keywords.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is overwrought ("thrust skyward," "ancient leviathans") and lacks rhythmic variety, leaning on heavy modification. The reuse of the phrase "Quietly articulate" in identical syntactic positions acts as a distracting artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prompt forcing severely damages sentence flow, notably the clunky construction: "Via the static-laden confessions on that old cordless phone, the air thickened..." "Action of metamorphosis" is similarly unnatural. The prose relies heavily on filtering and static description rather than active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive insertion of required phrases; "resonantly soft" appears three times and "gap between knowing and understanding" three times in a short space. These repetitions act as text artifacts that stall momentum and draw attention to the writing's construction. The rhythm is often clunky due to these insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and high metaphor density (e.g., "cobalt lights flickering like veins under bruised skin"). This "purple" style creates drag and occasionally muddles clarity, prioritizing poetic sound over efficient communication of the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mechanical repetition of required phrases (e.g., "misting hush" x4, "quietly persistent" x3) creates severe artifacts that disrupt flow and immersion. The prose suffers from "adjective-itis," relying on stacked modifiers ("whispering gleam," "velvet stillness") that reduce narrative muscularity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished but dense with modifier-heavy constructions ("worn oak," "tattered silk," "fractal elegies") and similes. There is a tendency toward "template cadence" in the middle section that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple" artifacts, including cliché metaphor stacks ("tendrils of pink pierced the veil," "shimmering vision"). The reliance on abstract noun-adjective pairings reduces line-level propulsion and clarity in favor of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is severely marred by the excessive repetition of specific phrases ("hush" x10, "improbable longing" x7, "unassumingly bold" x5, "disorient" x6). This creates a distracting, algorithmic cadence that overshadows any lyrical intent. The text relies on abstract nouns and adjectives ("enveloped secrets," "cosmic possibility") instead of concrete imagery, reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from modifier congestion (&quot;skeletal husks,&quot; &quot;otherworldly phosphorescence&quot;) and repetitive phrasing. The prompt phrase &quot;chronically curious&quot; is used twice as a fixed epithet. The term &quot;holographic tapestry&quot; creates a jarring register drift, introducing a sci-fi flavor that clashes with the established folkloric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.8)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, particularly the phrase "combative tenderness" and its variations, which appear four times in a short space. The playground swing description is repeated almost verbatim as a refrain, which disrupts flow. These repetitions read as forced prompt insertions rather than intentional stylistic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.5)
    Prose is heavily burdened by clichés ("pregnant with possibility," "twilight's afterglow") and clumsy repetition of prompt phrases ("radiant hush" appears four times; "insatiably creative" three times). These artifacts disrupt rhythm and signal a lack of lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from extreme repetition of prompt-derived phrases, creating a stuttering effect. "Lucid unrest" appears four times, and variations of "accumulating silence" and "interlaced hush" appear over eight times combined in a short space, reading as unedited scaffold rather than intentional motif.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant text artifacts and loops are present; phrases like "methodically curious," "shielded openness," and "rain-scoured" appear verbatim multiple times, creating a robotic template cadence. The prose frequently uses a "Label, Action" structure that reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is overwritten and adjective-heavy ("fragile paths," "eternal twilight," "futile defiance"), often obscuring clarity for the sake of sound. Scientific terms are used as loose metaphors ("Schrödinger's wave," "dark energy"), resulting in "science-magic" artifacts that clutter the text.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of key phrases and adjective-heavy description ("perpetual vapor," "faithful shadow"). The recurring use of "tinkersong wonder" and "driftingly alert" as labels creates a distracting scaffold that lowers the density and quality of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=2.8)
    The text contains a disqualifying proofreading failure: a raw drafting note ("Wait, too many—trimming in mind...") is left in the climax, obscuring the closure and rendering the piece unpublishable. Beyond this fatal artifact, the prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" (e.g., "prismatic rays dancing like captive auroras") that reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive artifacts clutter the prose; specific phrases like "quietly explosive" (4 uses), "dusty starlight" (4 uses), and "spooled wholeness" (5 uses) loop incessantly. These repetitions act as semantic satiation and reveal a checklist-driven approach that destroys prose rhythm and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    The specific phrase "fractally precise" appears four times, alongside three other uses of "fractal" (seven total in a short text), creating a severe "template cadence" artifact. This repetitive lexical loop bludgeons the reader and mars the otherwise high-quality prose.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from adverb abuse, particularly in dialogue tags ("said sociably," "laughed sociably"), which is a major stylistic flaw. Over-reliance on modifiers creates a cluttered texture that reduces immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from "purple" abstraction and metaphorical clutter ("exhaling chill breath," "prismatic ghosts," "forgotten sighs") that obscures concrete action. The phrase "driftwood nostalgia" appears twice as a label rather than an evoked feeling, acting as a repetitive artifact. The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from purple metaphors ("doubt thorned their unity," "brambled hope stirred"). Key prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly, creating clunky rhythms ("strangely trustworthy" in dialogue). The density is low due to the reliance on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lexical redundancy is a significant issue; distinct phrases ("pane of hush," "nested patterns," "bruised," "beautifully flawed") are repeated frequently, creating a stalling rhythm. Forced usage of required terms results in awkward syntax ("vouchsafe it") that disrupts the prose flow.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is descriptive but suffers from significant lexical repetition ("graceless" appears three times, "clumsy" three times) that dulls the impact. Additionally, the middle section uses a scaffolded list structure ("One down," "Second mark," "Third assembly") that feels mechanical and interrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and metaphor, leading to drag. A significant redundancy appears in "bubbles diverging in frothy divergence," creating a distracting loop. The relentless figurative language ("bruised purples," "ephemeral lattices," "iridescent films") obscures the action and reduces narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and imagistic, but suffers from a high density of adjective-noun pairings ("crystalline boughs," "translucent limbs," "pale shimmer") that occasionally slows momentum. The required phrase "mindfully scattered" is repeated three times verbatim, which feels mechanical and creates a noticeable artifact in an otherwise smooth text.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on cliché ("metallic tang," "weighing his chest like lead") and mixed metaphors ("sorrow like spilled ink"). High density of "purple" descriptors ("sun-baked," "unspoken," "sturdy brittle") slows momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with adjectives (&quot;shadowy grain elevators rising like silent titans&quot;). The prompt phrase &quot;vigorous tender&quot; is pasted verbatim into the text four times, creating a clumsy repetitive artifact. Phrasing often feels strained (&quot;plummeting, plummeting star-glint&quot;) and melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition of complex phrases ("chaotically precise," "quaking reverie," "helix-minded") acts as a major text artifact, occurring 3–4 times each in a short space. The prose is overwritten with dense adjectival strings that obscure action and pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("latent blaze" x4, "seeds of vigilance" x4) which create noticeable loops. This "prompt stuffing" disrupts the rhythm and turns key descriptions into recurring labels rather than fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe text artifacts mar the prose; complex phrases like "symphonically minded" and "empathy in motion" are repeated three times each in a short space, creating a template cadence. Additionally, motivation and method are "told" in summary blocks rather than shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    Functional prose is weakened by noticeable repetition ("Thoughtfully precise" appears as a sentence opener and description within a short span) and cliché phrases ("velvet sky," "gathering dusk"). These artifacts flatten the texture and reduce the impact of the stronger imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is marred by significant overwriting ("sigh softer than moth wings," "gravid silence") and the clumsy, ungrammatical forced insertion of "intuitively descriptive" as an adverbial phrase three times. These artifacts, combined with high-density figurative language, obscure clarity and stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.0)
    Redundant phrasing ("olfactorily sensitive nose") and mechanical repetition of prompt terms ("wildflower hush," "tide's thought") create a checklist feel. The prose suffers from adjective stacking that slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.0)
    The phrase "whirling silence" is repeated three times, creating a distracting text artifact/loop. Adjective stacking ("obsidian shard, jagged and ancient") creates rhythmic drag in what should be high-momentum beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from keyword stuffing, with phrases like "rapidly adapting" (5x), "singular convergence" (3x), and "foresight" (4x) appearing as clumsy artifacts. This repetition creates a drumbeat of redundancy that stalls momentum and reads like a template response.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is overwritten, with a high density of adjectives and metaphors ("flawless frost," "honeyed sunlight") that slows momentum. Integration of prompt phrases creates syntactic awkwardness ("with the method through the colors of the aurora"), and "synesthetically blessed senses" is a redundant label.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from awkward phrasing, particularly in the integration of required terms ("Avalanchingly quiet it was" and "the action long ritualized: uncase"). There is a tendency toward melodrama and adjective-heavy description that slows momentum. Sentence rhythm is somewhat repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and "thesaurus-itis," with phrases like "sorrow's arcuate path" and "joy equaled sorrow's derivative" creating unintentional clunkiness. Adjective-noun pairings are frequent and heavy ("ethereal inks," "deliberate ambiguity," "lucid turbulence"), creating a dense texture that drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lexical repetition ("routine" x6, "germinate" x4) and the use of clichés ("cracking like dry leaves," "hammer on anvil") mar the prose rhythm. The density of purple prose slows momentum without adding sufficient clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density, with nearly every sentence containing a simile or figurative flourish (e.g., "mist like frozen prayers," "shatter like thin ice," "sharp as unanswered questions"). This relentless ornamentation halts narrative momentum and results in a "template cadence" of adjective-noun pairings that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is heavily marred by "text artifacts" and loops. Specific complex phrases ("hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "stoically sparkling," "latent sacrifice") are repeated verbatim multiple times in a short space, creating a robotic, droning cadence that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetitive artifacts mar the prose; "deliberate/deliberately" appears seven times, and "azure" and "confusion" are also overused, creating a mechanical rhythm. The prose is overly dense with modifiers and strained metaphors ("shadows that parted like mist"), impeding momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is dense with adjectives and mixed metaphors ("inspirations bloomed unbidden like nocturnal flowers," "tang of betrayal"). The reliance on abstract filter verbs ("felt," "realized") and clichés ("skeletal giants") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=1.2)
    The text contains fatal drafting artifacts and self-correction logs ("Wait, writing properly," "Adjust," "Over"), rendering it unpublishable. The prose prior to the break is functional but laden with adjective-heavy constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition of fixed phrases ("shadowed elation," "total internal reflection," "glass lantern wick") appears three times each, triggering artifact penalties. Adjective density is high ("velvet sky," "spectral signals"), slowing momentum and cluttering the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is weighed down by clunky phrasing ("valley-mist shrouded realm," "question quietly explosive") and repetition of prompt words. The density of modifiers impedes momentum, and the "quietly explosive" repetition acts as a jarring artifact that disrupts the reading rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is dense with imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting and "telling" emotional states ("sorrow not vast and poetic but precisely measured"). Metaphors are frequent and sometimes stack up ("grieving limbs," "indifferent sky"), slowing momentum without adding causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors and adjective stacking ("mosaic of fragmented recollections that flickered like fireflies in fog"). This overwriting ("molten dawnlight," "golden filaments") clutters the causality and reduces immediacy, prioritizing ornamental description over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is overwritten with strained metaphors ("creases a tactile map of hesitation") and adjective stuffing. The phrase "enlarged tranquility" is repeated as a clumsy, inserted scaffold rather than established as a pervasive atmospheric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from high metaphorical density and frequent "like [abstract concept]" similes that obscure rather than clarify the action. Several prompt-mandated phrases appear as clumsy text artifacts ("creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle") that disrupt syntax and flow. There is a tendency toward overwriting that slows the propulsion of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "gently meticulous" appears five times, and "illusions faded to memory" is used as a verbatim refrain three times in a short space. Additionally, sentence structures often loop ("By sampling...", "He [verb]..."), creating a template-like cadence that distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant deductions for text artifacts: the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases and the explicit scaffold labels ("False start one," "False start two") disrupt the flow and read like an outline rather than finished prose.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=2.8)
    The text contains egregious non-narrative artifacts (`[Word count calibrated.]`, `[Final adjustment ensures bounds.]`) that render it unpublishable in a literary context. The prose itself is often overwritten with dense adjective-noun clusters ("sweet, electric tang," "raw pulse," "chrome spire") that slow momentum. These artifacts in the closure beat attract the maximum penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is marred by significant repetitive artifacts and tautologies in a short space (e.g., "mnemonic memory" is a redundancy; "auroral sorrow" appears three times). Metaphors are often mixed or cliché ("uncork... bottled storm... subterranean springs"). Adjective-noun pairing is excessive ("charcoal-fingered hands," "jovial echoes," "jagged floors").

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense with specific imagery ("zinc ridges like Braille confessions"), but sentence structures become repetitive, often relying on "She [verb]" openers. This syntactic monotony drags the momentum slightly despite the high quality of the descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive phrasing and "purple" artifacts distract; the phrase "muted vigor" is repeated three times (lines 3, 9, 31), and "glisten" is awkwardly nominalized ("Glistens cascaded"). The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("frostbitten petals," "crimson curiosity") that reduce density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is functional and dense with good momentum, though some phrasing leans into melodrama ("thousand fragmented screams") or formulaic beat markers ("Chaos erupted," "Chaos contained"). These artifacts slightly dull the scene's freshness but do not break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.0)
    The phrase "sandstorm calm" is repeated four times in a short space, creating a distracting artifact that reads like a prompt-check rather than craft. Phrasing is often awkward to accommodate required words ("leads through following"), and clichés abound ("feuds dissolving like dew," "tears mingled").

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("calm defiance" x4, "mysterious familiarity" x3, "spider spins its web" x3) creates a mechanical, checklist-like cadence that halts momentum. Metaphors are mixed and cluttered (dice, spiders, krakens, ballet, algorithms all in one scene). The prose suffers from adjective stuffing ("phosphorescent algae," "watertight alloy," "arcane method") that reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant repetitive artifacts appear: the distinct phrases "fluctuating/fluctuated mysteriously" and "gleaming silence" are both repeated verbatim. Phrasing often relies on adverbs and clichés ("burning motivation") rather than precise verbs and nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers significantly from the forced repetition of required phrases; "tranquil blaze" appears five times and "terrestrially cosmic" three times, creating a jarring, looped cadence. This "synonym churn" and reliance on adjective-heavy abstraction ("serene luminosity," "eternal quiet") obscures the action and stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=3.6)
    Significant deduction for repetitive artifacts; specific phrases ("patiently nimble," "mysteriously familiar," "motive," "interrogate") appear three times each in a short space, creating a mechanical, looping rhythm. These artifacts clutter the prose and break the immersion at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant overwriting and repetition severely hamper momentum. The phrase "ghostly resolve" appears four times, acting as a lexical crutch, while "velvet garden" and "tragically radiant" also repeat. The density of adjective-noun pairings stifles the rhythm and creates a purple texture.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and figurative muddle ("vein of quartz gleamed like forgiven secrets"). Dense adjective-noun pairings ("languid rhythm," "invisible absolution," "calibrated treason") clog the rhythm and obscure the action. The style draws attention to itself rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by register breaks (the corporate/technical term "progressive disclosure" clashes with the fantasy setting) and repetitive word usage (four variations of "ensure" in a short space). Adjective density obstructs momentum ("greed-laced pulse," "shimmers of hidden intent").

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is dense with similes and adjectives that often obscure clarity ("breath fogging the air like borrowed starlight" is a confusing image). High usage of filter words and abstract nouns ("viscous pool," "ethereal silver") slows momentum. The reliance on ornate description distracts from the causal chain of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is overwritten with adjective-noun clusters ("gossamer webs," "indifferent embrace") that clutter the rhythm. The narrative violates baseline physical constraints by having a fragile bamboo whisk repair a fishing net without damage, creating a significant logic break. Prompt-forced phrases like "scintillatingly somber" appear as clumsy artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose friction is noticeable. Phrases like "Elias's sharp observance spotted" are tautological and clunky. The repetition of stems ("He intuited...") and descriptors ("sharp") within a short space creates a template cadence. "Confetti-like shreds... shredded letters" is redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.3)
    Severe repetition of specific keywords ("gritty" appears 7 times; "whimsy/whimsical" 6 times) creates distracting text artifacts that ruin the prose rhythm. The figurative language is frequently mixed or incoherent ("lightning's gritty whimsy").

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is weighed down by excessive modifiers and poeticisms ("frail as spider silk," "splendorous sorrow"). The forced insertion of prompt phrases creates awkward rhythmic stumbles (e.g., "positively wistful joy"). There is a reliance on telling emotions through labels rather than showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is weighed down by a high density of adjectives and a jarring repetition of the word "fleshly" (used six times in varied, often awkward contexts like "fleshly click"). The writing suffers from "thesaurus-itis," where clarity is sacrificed for decorative complexity ("awakening leviathans," "tendrils of fog coiling"), resulting in significant momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.3)
    Severe repetitive artifacts lower the quality; specific prompt phrases ("softly purposeful," "restrained wildness," "horizon mapper") are looped three to four times each in a short space. This mechanical repetition creates a "scaffold" effect that disrupts prose rhythm and highlights the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("iron grip," "whip cracking like thunder," "leash tightening"). Several prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly as "label-speak" ("fortified vulnerability," "watchfully calm"), disrupting the narrative flow and lowering the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts drag the score down; the phrase "aptly deliberate" is pasted in three times, and "vibrant hush" and "calm before realization" twice each, creating a looping, mechanical rhythm. The prose is dense with mixed metaphors and excessive similes ("fingers steady as prayer," "tools fine as whispers") that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe text-artifact issues: the required phrases "irreverent awe" and "steadily curious" are repeated ~6 times each, often as sentence openers or tags, creating a distractingly looped rhythm. The prose leans purple ("sprockets gossiping steam," "belched up treasure") and relies on telling/summary to advance the plot, violating the show-don't-tell preference for key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=2.1)
    The text contains fatal drafting artifacts (e.g., "No, wait—word count exceeded; trim back mentally..."), rendering it unpublishable in its current state. While the surrounding prose is competent, these raw output errors in the pivotal scene are disqualifying flaws for a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is dense with abstract metaphors ("edges sharp as betrayal") and suffers from "prompt stuffing," where required phrases are inserted verbatim as labels. The register slip ("holographic") disrupts the vintage atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.5)
    Heavy repetition of prompt phrases ("windborne solace" x3, "woke up changed" x2, "loose grip" x2) feels mechanical and disrupts flow. Metaphors are frequent and sometimes mixed ("fold in patience," "crease in fine paper," "silk tearing").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with mixed metaphors and abstract phrasing ("clove and destiny's quiet ache") that prioritizes sound over sense. The text relies on "telling" via inserted prompt phrases ("by drawing parallels," "voice gently persuasive") instead of depicting the mechanics of the scene organically.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetitive artifacts render the prose unpublishable. "Strangely honest" appears six times, "whisperfield calm" five times, and "murmuring pavilion"/variations six times in a short text; this keyword stuffing obscures all other craft.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetition of specific prompt phrases ("earnest whimsy" appears four times; "transmute" and "perceptively calm" recur frequently) creates a mechanical, looped effect. The prose is often "purple" and abstract, prioritizing ornamentation over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant text-artifact penalties apply due to excessive looping of specific phrases. "Weathered innocence" appears five times, "suspended hush" five times, and "fractured sequences" four times; this repetition reads as a scaffold/generating artifact rather than a purposeful motif, severely engaging the Loop/Scaffold penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting ("prophecy-forged fingers," "barnacle-crusted heartstones") and distracting alliteration ("subtle susurrus"). The phrase "tidal longing" is repeated four times, acting as a label-loop that dulls the emotional impact rather than deepening it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetitive artifacts degrade the prose quality. The phrase "luminous ache" appears six times, acting as a semantic crutch, while "changelessly constant" appears three times. These "text loops" reveal the mechanical stitching of prompt elements and disrupt the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from meta-commentary ("core concept made tangible") and forced repetition of prompt phrases ("pulsing stillness"). Clichéd metaphors ("grooves cracked like fault lines") and high adjective density clutter the line-level experience.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is severely marred by the verbatim repetition of "quietly deliberate" four times in a short text (paras 1, 11, 18, 22), creating a distracting loop artifact. While the descriptive language is functional, this blatant recycling of a specific modifier signals a lack of lexical control and editorial polish.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is riddled with semantic hallucinations and misuse of language that render sentences incoherent (e.g., "innovative memories," "yearned her forward," "nostalgic riot"). These are not poetic choices but functional breaks in English usage. Repetitive phrasing ("shrewdly innocent," "cleft") and misuse of transitive verbs create high friction, making the text unpublishable in a literary context.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition of specific words ("zephyr" used 4 times, "resurfaced" 4 times) acts as a mechanical scaffold that distracts from the story. The phrase "reflectively vibrant" is repeated three times as a fixed, awkward epithet, and the prose suffers from intense "thesaurus-itis" (e.g., "zephyr of celestial petals").

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "honeyed hush" appears four times, and "vulnerability" appears five times in a very short text. The writing relies on heavy metaphor stacking and abstract nouns instead of concrete verbs, stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of long prompt phrases ("swirling hush," "against the current," "inside the whisper of closing pages") multiple times within a short space. This creates a mechanical, stuttering rhythm and registers as a scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (multiple uses of "vine tendril," "golden stories," "whimsical") and clichéd imagery ("light as thistledown"). Filter verbs ("Elowen felt," "saw") and adjective-heavy constructions slow momentum and reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.5)
    Significant repetition harms the prose: "moving stillness" appears three times, and "world held/holding its breath" twice. The phrase "demonstrated it physically now" is mechanical telling that disrupts the scene's immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetitive phrasing weakens the prose, particularly the six uses of "peripheral/peripherally" and four variations of "wounded season/lull" within a short space. These distinct lexical loops act as scaffold artifacts, drawing attention to the writing process rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition loops and artifact-like phrasing. The awkward construction "boundary-lessly" appears three times, and fixed phrases like "shingled hush" (3x) and "kerosene lamp burner" (4x) stifle the flow. These repetitions read as forced checklist insertions rather than organic descriptors, violating the standard for publishable craft.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant deduction for text artifacts and looping. The phrase "rust-hued peace" appears three times (beginning, middle, end), and "hauntingly practical" appears twice; this repetition reads as accidental or scaffold-based rather than rhythmic, cluttering the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally dense and descriptive, but the piece suffers significantly from lexical repetition of prompt phrases. Variations of "chronological" appear six times and "fractured" five times in a short space, creating a distracting text artifact that breaks immersion and dulls the closure image ("In chronological peace").

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetition of prompt keywords ("stoic" x3, "wonder" x3, "maze" x5, "intentions" x4) dulls the prose. The text relies on "purple" phrasing ("stress fractures that whispered of unmet promises") that favors abstraction over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetitive artifacts (e.g., "petrichor nostalgia" used 4x, "glacial hush" 4x, "excruciatingly gentle" 3x) create a robotic, template-like cadence that severely damages flow. Adjective stacking ("dust-veiled and mechanism-stilled") and abstract noun agents clutter the rhythm and obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts harm the prose quality. The phrase "By training instincts" is used three times as a sentence opener in a grammatically awkward fashion, and "thoughtfully clear" and "serene upheaval" repeat mechanically. These loops constitute a major craft failure that obscures the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts harm the prose. The phrase "infinitely patient" appears five times, and "oceanic hush" three times, creating a mechanical, cut-and-paste rhythm. These loops turn character traits and atmospheric tags into scaffolding that clutters the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with clichéd similes ("crimson as arterial blood," "soft as a lover's sigh") and melodramatic adjectives. The prompt phrase "lonesome splendor" is repeated three times verbatim, creating a distracting text artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition of keywords ("quaking" ×9, "hypothesize" ×9, "reverie" ×5) constitutes a major text artifact that obstructs flow. Phrasing often strains into incoherence ("tears quaking," "stalactites leaned in reverie") due to forcing these constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and "purple" descriptors ("flames had once kissed her arms," "whispered of ancient volcanic calm"). Information density is lowered by metaphoric redundancy, where the text describes an object and then immediately explains its symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of epithets ("luminous" x5, "sidereal" x4, "defiant hush" x2) and awkward prompt-forced phrasing ("realistically imaginative"). Modifier stacking clogs the rhythm, and the "realistically imaginative" tag feels mechanically inserted.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers severely from repetitive phrasing and lexical loops that act as crutches. Key phrases like "troubling serenity" (4 uses), "quiet sigh" (4 uses), "approximates infinity" (4 uses), and the word "ping" (12 uses) create a distracting, formulaic rhythm that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is severely hampered by artifact loops, with specific phrases ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm," "thoughtful," "retrace") each repeated 3–5 times in a short space. This mechanical insertion creates a checklist effect that destroys rhythm and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("searing reverie," "ethically diligent," "incremental absolution," "emerged") creates a distracting, artificial cadence. These loops act as scaffold text, prioritizing the insertion of terms over narrative flow and violating the standard for flawless prose.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases triggers the artifact penalty: "velveteen gloom" (4x), "blithe" (4x), "uncharted echoes" (4x), and "antique sovereign case" (3x) create distracting loops. The prose relies on these stock labels instead of fresh, specific imagery, making the text feel generated rather than crafted.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.6)
    The mandatory phrase "groundedly imaginative" is repeated awkwardly, disrupting the prose rhythm and breaking immersion. Additionally, moments of overwriting ("quill's kiss," "infinitesimal from union") obscure clarity in favor of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe text artifacts degrade the prose quality; the specific phrases "thistled calm" and "secretly luminous" are repeated verbatim four times each, functioning as mechanical fillers rather than organic description. This looping creates a significant distraction and signals a lack of line-level editorial control.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally evocative, with high density and strong imagery ("shards glinting like fractured memories"). However, the inclusion of raw drafting artifacts ("No, trim later—wait, count precise...") in the final climax is a catastrophic flaw for a flawless-standard publication. This artifact obscures the final image and disrupts the rhythm of the ending, triggering a significant deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe text-artifacting occurs due to the forced repetition of prompt phrases ("agonize/agonized" x5, "rationally rebellious" x3, "abrasive calm" x3). These verbatim repetitions within a short space create a mechanical cadence that disrupts immersion and highlights the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=2.4)
    Prose is marred by severe repetition of prompt phrases (loops) and misused vocabulary. "Across unlearning hatred" is used ungrammatically as a prepositional time-marker three times, and "denoted" is forced into contexts where it fits poorly, creating jarring artifacts that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose suffers from adjective stacking ("ethereal shafts," "rare cosmic resonance") and purple abstractions. The clinical phrase "synaptic plasticity" is repeated three times, creating a jarring, repetitive artifact that disrupts the atmospheric rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft is marred by redundancy and repetitive phrasing. "Nectar dusk" loops frequently; modifiers like "said candidly" (for a character already defined as candid) and "truthful even in urging" create tautologies that drag momentum. Adjective density is high, occasionally cluttering the visual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is overwritten with "purple" phrasing ("violet earth laced with tears," "pulse with quiet fire") and repetitive refrains ("streetlights daydreamed" appears three times). Abstract nouns and frequent personification clutter the sentences, reducing clarity and narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetitive phrasing harms the prose ("forgotten" x3, "cascade/cascading" x4, "certainty" x7, "revelation" x3). These lexical loops create a mechanical template feel. A typos ("certainty a anchor") and the oxymoronic clunkiness of "animate lifeless" further detract.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.2)
    Significant repetition artifacts mar the prose; "texture" appears five times and "grim optimism" three times in a short space, creating a lexically repetitive loop. The forcing of the phrase "balancedly daring" results in clumsy syntax that draws attention to the writing rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is atmospheric and rhythmically sound, though occasionally overwritten with sentimental phrasing ("kiss the brush’s tip," "womb of glowing symbols"). The description of the "saffron quiet" establishes a strong, if synesthetic, tone.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe repetition of key phrases (e.g., "rosewater dread" and "displaced persons" both appear four times) creates a scaffolded, artificial texture. The prose leans purple ("spring's cruel kiss," "silken thread") and lacks economy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive loops degrade the prose quality; specific phrases ("neatly inventive," "bleak exhilaration," "latent radiance") appear 4–5 times each in a short space, often ungrammatically. These artifacts act as scaffolding that obscures the narrative flow, triggering maximum penalties for text loops touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is severely hampered by the forced repetition of prompt terms; "unbosom" appears over half a dozen times, and "repulsive allure" and "resuscitation" are looped to the point of semantic satiation. This creates a "prompt-salad" effect where the machinery of the challenge obscures the story's rhythm and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is marred by significant "telling" artifacts, including the explicit definition ("Dub: to overlay...") and the summary of method ("Fractal generating was his method"), which act as scaffolding rather than narrative. While the imagery is lush, these expository interruptions halt momentum and distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("sunwashed dread" appears three times; "quietly driven" twice) within a short space. This creates a scaffolded, repetitive cadence that distracts from the otherwise competent line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is purple and cluttered with modifiers ("iron girders choked," "splintered wooden bench"); the phrase "emotionally rational" is repeated three times as a clumsy tag. A dangling modifier in the climax ("Walking away, the bare rosebush seemed to nod") breaks syntactic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing and adjectival clutter. The prompt phrase "hushed blaze" appears five times, becoming a distracted linguistic tic rather than a tonal undercurrent. The phrase "stoically sensitive" is used as a clunky modifier, and metaphors like "debris clawing like jealous ghosts" feel overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.8)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, reusing specific phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness," "readjusted," "honest origins") three or more times each in a short space. This algorithmic repetition creates a droning effect that distracts from the prose and triggers the penalty for template cadence and loops.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers severely from "purple" overwriting and adjective stuffing (e.g., "luminous torment," "radiant agony," "fragmented dreams," "prismatic grief"). This density chokes narrative momentum and violates the clarity standard; the metaphors obscure the action rather than illuminating it. The text relies on synonym churn ("torment," "agony," "grief") instead of precise, concrete nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("intangibly tangible," "bleak exhilaration," "perturbation theory") which disrupts the rhythm. Adjectival density ("jagged purple crystal," "roiling haze") occasionally slows momentum and feels like scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive artifacts damage the prose; specific phrases like "perpetually surprised" and "brilliant dimness" are repeated 5-6 times each, creating a robotic, looping cadence. These repetitions act as semantic stops rather than motifs, and the reliance on adjectival stacking ("brilliant dimness," "jagged cliff," "fragmented star chart") clutters the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.2)
    Line-level craft is marred by egregious repetition. Unique phrases like "sieved hush" and "tempered regret" appear 4–5 times each in a short space, creating distracting text loops that would trigger immediate rejection in a literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.0)
    Significant issues with repetitive, forced phrasing. The specific phrases "furrowed hush," "uncommonly thoughtful," and "recycle" are repeated multiple times in awkward contexts to satisfy the prompt, creating a loop/scaffold effect that disrupts the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant line-level flaws include tautologies ("Waves slapped... like accusatory slaps"), mixed metaphors ("tide pools stirred" do not "slither"), and repetitive lexical loops ("merrily melancholic," "gravitated," "backlash"). These artifacts obscure clarity and break the narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=2.5)
    Prose is marred by severe repetition and forced phrasing; "delicately robust" appears twice in awkward contexts, and "jaded wonder" becomes a distracting tic. The writing leans on purple abstractions ("ghosts of a dirty past," "echoes lingered") rather than concrete, active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "paradoxically steady" is looped six times in a short text, and "cosmic intimacy" appears three times. The writing suffers from adjective stuffing and cliché constructions ("unyielding veil," "dew-kissed roots") that clutter sentences and reduce narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and mixed metaphors that obscure clarity (e.g., "moon that bloated the sky like a bruised lung," "beauty strangling her throat with perfumed mist"). The density of figurative language in high-pressure beats creates a "purple" texture that acts as a barrier to the narrative flow, violating the economy bias expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.5)
    Line-level craft is marred by clumsy prompt insertions ("Via the faint shimmer...") and mixed metaphors ("sweat-like static"). The prose relies on abstract summary rather than concrete, sensory-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is cluttered with mixed metaphors ("hush... exploded into silent symphony") and excessive modification that slows the narrative momentum. The density of adjectives and "poetic" abstract nouns obscures the action, resulting in a text that feels decorated rather than constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from keyword stuffing, particularly the phrases "winking hush" (used 5 times) and "calmly inventive" (used 3 times), which creates a mechanical, repetitive cadence. This repetition functions as a text artifact that distracts from the narrative. While the grammar is clean, the density of mixed metaphors ("blackout... conspiring," "twilight's sly grin") reduces clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from "adjective stuffing" and clunky constructions like "precognitively cursed gift" or "aurora's borrowed dawn glow." There is a tendency toward prepositional bloat ("visions of futures," "veils of promise") that slows the rhythm. The fragmented sentence structure at the end feels melodramatic rather than earned by the narrative pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive modifiers, mixed metaphors ("thunder applauded"), and the awkward, repetitive insertion of prompt words ("rarefy the air," "rarefy his craft"). This "purple prose" creates a barrier to immersion, drawing attention to the writing's effort rather than the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts degrade the prose; "dignified chaos" appears four times and "diplomatically fierce" three times (once ungrammatically). These blatant insertions disrupt rhythm and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is cluttered with mixed metaphors ("voice a luminous fracture of gravel") and repetitive phrasing ("luminous fracture" appears four times). Clichés like "eyes sharp as shattered glass" and "broken teeth" reduce the distinctness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant deduction for keyword stuffing; the specific prompt phrase "steely longing" appears four times, and "strategically creative" or its variations appear four times, creating a mechanical template cadence. The prose is otherwise functional but overly dependent on adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant prose artifacts lower the score: the phrase "empirically whimsical" appears five times, "luminous" seven times, and "doubt" eight times in a short text. This synonym looping and repetitive tagging creates a "scaffold" effect that obstructs the narrative flow and reduces line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose is fatally compromised by the obsessive, clumsy repetition of prompt phrases; "rhythmically placid" appears six times, often with poor usage ("rhythmically placid chant"). "Diffuse/diffused" and "cerulean regret" are similarly looped, creating a mechanical, echo-chamber effect that ruins flow and clarity.

    Paraphrase loops on "drawing parallels" (four instances) and "emotionally rational" (repeated verbatim) create template cadence in final third, dulling closure propulsion (−1.1); high density elsewhere, rhythm varies. Minor synonym churn on "pit of lies."

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy overwriting with figurative language in every high-pressure sentence (e.g., "hushed blaze," "restrained embers") violates density check, dulling propulsion during repairs. Paraphrase loops in "interlaced absence"/"severed promises" and template cadence in repetitive "wrestled" beats obscure cause/effect. Closure image muddled by stacked metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Repetitive trait phrases ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive") create minor paraphrase loops mid-story, but density and propulsion clear to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., polishing hums visions while advancing rite); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density in peak polish/projection beats purposeful for lyric tone, no muddle/coherence loss. No loops/scaffold; "luminous torment" recurrence pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density in "virtual particles pregnant with power" propels without loops; minor "bleak exhilaration" echoes purposeful, though slight repetition nudges from peak.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "boots clanging softly" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies, motif repetition purposeful. Minor overwriting in stacked lights ("cascade of light as star trail data flooded") but no muddle or loops touching closure. Clean mechanics, varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density integrates action and image, but patterned repeats like "sieved hush" and "tempered regret" border loop in reflective beats; rhythm varies purposefully without muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    High density with multi-job lines, but repetitive artifacts ("furrowed hush," "mist clung/shrouded/swirled," "recycle/uncommon") create paraphrase loops and template cadence across opening beats, dulling propulsion; overwriting in exchange climax with stacked modifiers obscures peak clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with purposeful motif repetition ("merrily melancholic," "flickering faith") taught early as pattern; minor figurative density in regrets beats slightly muddles peak swell without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    Overwriting with stacked figures like "leather cracked like ancient parchment yet unyielding" and repeated "jaded wonder"/"delicately robust" create artifact loops in opening and climax, dulling propulsion. Some paraphrase in journey summary ("hours blurred into... odyssey"). Density high but muddled metaphors obscure peak tear moment; rhythm varies but template echoes in descriptive stems.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting with figurative density in every climax sentence ("ethereal tendrils... nebulae", "antlers of starlight") dulls propulsion; "paradoxically steady" exact-repeat loop x4 creates template cadence touching closure para. Paraphrase redundancy in ending summaries ("forged anew... bonds transcended") drags momentum. Rhythmic variety present but undermined by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion (short peak sentences at saucer pry). Overwriting in metaphors ("bloated bruised lung," "velvet noose") strains slightly in opening but consistent/voice-motivated, closure clean. Minor repetition ("choking beauty," "willingly perplexed") patterned, not looped.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., photos amplify stitching); varied rhythm supports propulsion, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (mist/shimmers/fireflies) during peak integration slightly muddles clarity without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm varies with scene (murmurs accelerate to "silent symphony"); density high, but patterned "hush" repetition borders loop in peak beat (volcano sigh). Figuratives purposeful ("miniature auroras") without muddle; no scaffolds obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Repetitive loops ("winking hush," "calmly inventive," "cradle" phrasing) create paraphrase churn in ending third, dulling propulsion; −1.1 total artifacts. Rhythm varies but overwriting in metaphors like "thief in velvet gloves" borders muddle in buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density propels via multi-job lines, but minor patterned repetition in ending litany ("Promise lingered... Harnessed forever") risks paraphrase feel despite intentional sacred echo, slightly dulling closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm propels via varied syntax mirroring storm pulses; figurative density high but voice-motivated in peak ("lightning crowned the dome"), minor "pause/vigil" paraphrase loops drag slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Density high with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor artifacts: "dignified chaos" and "diplomatically fierce" loops slightly dull mid-duel peak without obscuring closure; no filter stacks or major muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    High info density but overwriting: figurative density ("luminous fracture" x3, "molted"/"shed") pervades rebuild beats without pattern break, dulling propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("rebuild/rebuild/reclaimed"). Rhythm varies but template stems in descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density and propulsion, but minor motif loops ("steely longing," "horizon invites night") create template cadence in journey beats without full pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density propels via varied rhythm, but luminous-metaphor density borders overwriting in opening ("fireflies in doubt"), slightly straining coherence without closure harm.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.7)
    Exact phrase repeats ("rhythmically placid" thrice, "slow-spoken" multiple) create template cadence obscuring climax propulsion; heavy metaphor density ("phantom winds," "incense scattering") muddles visions beat. Paraphrase loops on regrets/diffusion dull density.


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density high; one sentence often layers smell, tool, and metaphor (“spectrometer from greenhouse debris”). Rhythm breathes with action—no scaffold loops. Occasional modifier stacks (“iridescent butterflies fluttering from surviving fronds”) but they serve the lyric accumulative mode. Closing line lands clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: one sentence often fuses sensory cue, interior tilt, and forward motion (“She shattered a luminous orb… light exploding in blinding resonance”). Metaphors are glass-maker specific, not stock. Two near-paraphrases (“quiet canyon… drifting echo”) two paragraphs apart → −0.2. Closure sentence clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless clauses for aurora sweep, staccato fragments for fork strikes. Information density high—single sentences layer temperature, color, and emotional valence. No loops, no filler; every paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Metaphor vehicles remain internally consistent (glass = canvas, vibration = heartbeat) and pay off in the mending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer job and metaphor simultaneously: “souls he’d laid to rest in silt graves, only for their echoes to resurface as distress signals.” No loops or paraphrase packs appear; each clause adds new pressure or sensory angle. Only minor mixed metaphor risk—“lighthouse beam piercing fog until a cataclysmic quake submerged all”—but the image resolves causally, not confusingly. Register stays within Elias’s diction; no elevated diction invades the underwater grit.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong rhythmic propulsion; sentence variety good. Occasional cushion phrases (“gently persistent grace,” “threads of forgotten hope”) flirt with template cadence but do not clog beats. No mixed metaphors or loops. Information density high; each paragraph advances communal state or risk. Minor scaffolding in repeated “amplified quiet” but serves motif, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; only two paraphrase loops (“foggy lucidity”-adjacent phrases) trip the ear. Metaphors stay coherent—camera, breath, bloom all share translucence/flow logic. No filter-verb stacks; sentences open with concrete noun or motion verb. One mixed vehicle: “bottled within” immediately followed by “knotted reservoir” slightly jars containment metaphors, but occurs mid-scene, not at closure. Otherwise high density, variation, and rhythm control.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each figurative layer (sap-veins, pseudospherical helices) advances the central metaphor rather than decorating. Rhythm breathes—long horticultural clauses contract to “fragment hummed, then shrieked.” No scaffold loops; every sentence either advances stakes or textures time. One strained simile—“coarse as unraveling twine”—slips in the climax, keeping the score just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “splintered prize counter,” “arrow with strange fletching” replace generic nouns. One paraphrase loop—“staggering grace” appears three times—earns −0.3 but never muddies causality. Metaphors stay coherent: “concrete behemoth” for Wall, “forgotten dreams” for plush toys—no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with sonic snap; high information density achieved without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense, zero scaffold loops, metaphors mutually coherent (auroral veins = forge-light = heartbeat). The hammer-fall sentences shorten under mitotic fire, propelling the finale. A single mixed image—“silt clouding the glass” when the dome is already cracked—barely grazes the closure beat, keeping this shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences under sunset, staccato dashes during escape, hush at close. Information-dense: “emerald-veined panel yielded to her touch” does three jobs (setting, character, plot). Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends light motif without muddle. Minor purple tint—“luminous disbelief washed over her”—but serves tone. Closure line clean: “song of what was to come” recharges entire piece. One step below 9 only because figurative density peaks mid-escape, not at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is strong, with sentence-length variation that matches blower-breath tempo. Figurative layering is dense but coherent under the mythic frame; no mixed metaphors. A few near-repetitions (“thawed heart” variants) and filter stacks (“he declared,” “he narrated”) slightly dull immediacy in peak beats, preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors vertigo—short clauses at cliff-edge, elongated when decoding cast. Information density high: “seashell murmuring audibly now, spilling his secret phobia” does three jobs (sound, reveal, pivot) in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Exceptional line-level control under peak pressure justifies near-top band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for ambered hush, fragments at star-wink. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—each metaphor (amber, marble, resin) returns to mineral stillness, justifying density. No synonym churn; “hush” recurs with accruing weight. One mixed vehicle—“waves of quiet pooled”—minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences vary in length; momentum breathes with loop cadence. Occasional modifier stacks (“quantum potentials collapsing under observation”) flirt with density penalty but serve conceptual lift. No loops or synonym churn; pronoun reference clean. Opening and closing lines anchor and release effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Rain had polished the crystals to a mirror sheen, amplifying whispers into a symphony too soft for words, perfect for secrets” fuses setting, stake, and atmosphere in one breath. Rhythm modulates: longer susurrus clauses build hush, then staccato placements—“Slipping from his booth”—advance action. No mixed metaphors; crystal optics remain consistent. Minor paraphrase loop on “mistrust… mistrust” two sentences apart (−0.2), but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines: “clusters of crimson roses thrusting defiantly from tendrils shriveled by neglect” performs image, stakes, theme in one stroke. Rhythm modulates—ceremonial anaphora vs. clipped auditor rebuttal—without algorithmic pattern. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final third is clean; closure image is unmarred by prose artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet lucid; each sentence layers tool, body, and concept (“iridescent alloy suspended… projecting multidimensional lattices”). Figurative language is patterned early—fractal metaphors mirror alien wings—so later aurora imagery feels earned, not piled on. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“ignited,” “peeled,” “fogged”) propel. One paraphrase loop at meta aside (word-count self-talk) is non-story text; if excised, zero loops remain inside narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; every sentence advances either discovery or flood. Figurative language is spare and accurate—“lanterns bobbing like threats”—avoiding purple clutter. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; only micro-repeat is “lately inspired” refrain, acceptable as temporal marker. Strong paragraph cuts; each block advances beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors (veins like lightning, certainties sway like grasses) are spare, mixed only when intentional—“auroral sorrow” marries sky to grief without contradiction. High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. One paraphrase ripple: “weight of swallowed truth” is stated twice in close proximity—minor, but keeps this just below perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, high-density: most sentences advance action or atmosphere. Metaphors are spare and aligned (rusted valve / buried guilt) without mixed clashes. Occasional adjective stacks (“massive and corroded, jutting from a sealed bulkhead door”) slightly slow propulsion but do not recur at climax. No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or synonym churn detected. Opening and closing lines are crisp; middle段beats avoid scaffolding. Clean mechanics; pronoun reference stable.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned (paper = map = method); no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety is good; occasional “drift of untold seasons”-type template cadence (−0.2) repeats stem without fresh pressure. Information density strong—one sentence often layers setting, body, myth. Clean grammar; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences breathe with variable length, mirroring harp phrasing; no scaffold loops. Metaphors (dreaming roots, corona glow) stay consistent to arched shelter / celestial light logic. A few near-stack epithets—“softly adaptive” thrice—dull micro-rhythm, but none sit in the closure beat. Opening and final lines earn their keep by anchoring voice and recharging locket light.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “fingers trembling, he sifted… dragons… scales… gold” packs noun-verb without modifiers. Mixed metaphors avoided; “cosmic spindle” is single coherent vehicle. No loops or scaffold;只有两个模板化短语“the bronze quiet”在结尾处重复以产生咒语效果，已提前教授，故豁免。Closure beat无修辞杂乱。

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold loops or template cadence. Figurative language is spare and targeted—beam as “conductor of maritime fates.” High information density: each paragraph advances bar, stairs, or beam. A single mixed metaphor—“key turning in his soul’s rusty lock”—clicks but doesn’t stall momentum. Clean copy; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between staccato pedal clicks and swelling anaphora, mirroring the ritual. Information density high—each sentence layers sigil, sound, and theological pun. No paraphrase loops; white/void/paint/silence motifs track causal change rather than repeat for decoration. One strained metaphor: “cathedrals of quiet” is grandiose but fits the priestly POV; minor hairline, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is denser than standard but pattern-taught early: mercury silence, logarithmic whorls, upturned hush—reader learns to trust the cadence. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the musical motif without contradiction. Information density high—“pearlescent glow catching the first blush of dawn” does triple scene-work in nine words. Only minor artifact: “upturned hush” is repeated four times; the echo is intentional but edges toward mantra; −0.2 keeps it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—information plus image—propelling the read; variable rhythm mirrors motion from weightless glide to jagged dodge. Occasional stacked modifiers (“procedural generation etched into the clay—algorithms of fate weaving new paths from chaos”) border on surplus but never obscure causality or dull the final image. No filter-verb clusters, no synonym loops. Proofing clean; pronoun reference exact despite timeline leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long vibration-sentences swell, then clipped fragments when needle drops. Metaphors stay physical (“horn flared like a petrified shout”) and consistent with acoustic world. No synonym loops; each return of “hush” accrues new charge. One mixed vehicle—“shadows pooled like forgotten echoes”—is forgivable amid otherwise precise imagery that never stalls action.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: each sentence advances setting, character, or concept; no scaffold loops. Metaphors are meteorological and consistent; no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by her technician lexicon. Final line lands with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Metaphor density high yet coherent—light as scalpel, scent as neural key—without mixed-vehicle collision. One paraphrase loop: “He grieved…grieved openly” adjacent; minor −0.2. No scaffold sentences, no filter-verb stacks. Information layers (pollen scripts, terpene mimicry) compressed into two efficient sentences. Final line “heart lighter” lands cleanly without cliché because earned by prior weight.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work ("frayed end fraying further against the dust, a bridge"). Figurative runs are pattern-taught, not ornamental—spiral metaphors repay in closure. Minor scaffold: two adjacent "frayed" uses could compress. No paraphrase loops; pronouns clear; cadence accelerates into fusion beat then exhales—rhythm mirrors content.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose carries incantatory repetition (“unfinished,” “unbind”) that serves ritual cadence, not loop artifact. Metaphors stay coherent (hush as mourner, ship ribs as organ pipes). Dense lines do triple duty: “bowl’s contents shimmering: a child’s unfinished giggle…” advances plot, character, atmosphere. Minor filter verb clusters (“Lir heard… Lir knew”) are voice-motivated and brief.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary, no template churn. Figurative layering is high but patterned early (amber = resin = stasis) so it pays off, not clutters. One near-mixed metaphor (“storm’s prelude” beside “lover’s parting touch”) is minor. Information density strong; each sentence often does two jobs (scent + emotion, static + insight).

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    Strong nouns and verbs outweigh modifiers; information density high. Metaphors ("shelves swaying like cargo nets") are apt, yet three abstract-color adjectives per noun cluster in emotional peaks. Template cadence haunts repetitive “Elias…, then…” openers; filter verbs (“He felt…”) dilute immediacy. No typo, homophone, or pronoun drift; paragraph cuts crisp, but micro-scaffold remains visible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops; “luminescent ache” recurs with accruing weight, a taught pattern. Information density high—“callused from twisting supple reeds into forms that whispered of forgotten waters” does three jobs in twelve words. One minor scaffold: “Their group swelled, a tentative web forming…” could compress, but it propels. Final knot sentence is taut, propelling closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines are dense but seldom padded; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Opening anchors voice and stakes instantly; closing line (“the place… lived immortal in her art”) crystallizes the reconfiguration. Minor scaffold: “canals… canals… canals” anaphora twice in one paragraph; not enough to dull propulsion or touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythmic control high—sentence length varies to mimic drip, dovetail, heartbeat. Metaphors (moon-needles, iris-tears) are sustained, coherent, never mixed. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Minor density clot in “mathematics of emotion” phrase repeated twice, but does not stall closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences pull double duty: “Dust motes hung suspended in the dim blue, as if the world held its breath” renders atmosphere while foreshadowing the hush needed for tape playback. No synonym loops; “cache” is repeated only where functionally necessary. Metaphor density peaks in the opening but is taught early and paid off in final sapphire light. One mixed metaphor—“sapphire hush” is celestial yet terrestrial—but it is established as POV color-code and therefore coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer job-action + metaphor + internal shift. No scaffold loops; “circuitously sincere” repetition is pattern-taught early. Metaphors stay coherent—roots, bark, lightning—all botanically consistent. Minor register lift (“verdant core”) but occurs in low-pressure beat; closure image crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density: “rain softened the sand, revealing edges of something buried” fuses action + discovery + tactility. Occasional adjective drift (“haggard awe” twice, “wryly earnest” thrice) nudges toward template cadence but never stalls momentum. Mixed metaphor check clean: tides, bones, banners coherent. Rhythm breathes with scene—pre-dawn hush, then surf-roar finale. Copy-clean; only minor repetitive stems (“wryly earnest”) keep it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long clauses for approach, staccato for seizure. Figurative language is restrained to crystal and music domains, avoiding purple drift. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. Tense and pronoun reference remain clean; only minor scaffold in “steady/unpredictable” repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. One paraphrase loop (“trembling certainty” ×3) and a mixed metaphor (“fog made solid” beside “starlight on paper”) dull the final third. Otherwise, syntax varies, verbs stay strong, and no scaffold stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    High density lines do double duty: “whale songs formed an unheard symphony, rising from the deep like melodies no human ear could fully grasp” advances theme + atmosphere. Minor scaffold: “courageously kind” recurs 4× as epithet; not pattern-taught, so −0.3. Mixed metaphor once—“unheard symphony…vibrating through salt air”—but resolves cleanly. No loops touch closure; final paragraph is taut.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no filler loops, only one paraphrase echo (“hushed thunder”). Metaphors stay internally coherent—storm as magnetic veins, mutiny as lover-convergence—and serve acceleration, not ornament. Information density is high; each sentence layers image and motion. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric rolls build pressure, then fracture into fragments at collapse, mirroring content. A single misplaced simultaneity: “He rose, cloaked in refracted shadows, and attuned...” suggests these actions overlap when they likely sequence; minor but noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “sheet-draped yet radiating an eerie vigor” does triple visual, symbolic, hinge work. Rhythm varies from long chemical tang sentence to staccato timing beats. No synonym loops; “mathematics of fair trade” repeats with escalating stakes so allowed. Mixed metaphors avoided. Minor scaffold: “breach by waiting actively” concept restated twice; keeps clarity intact. Closure image clean; no artifact touches final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, syntactically varied; stacked participles serve the accumulative design taught in sentence 1. Information density is high—each sentence performs image + motive + world-rule. Mixed-metaphor risk (“blooming labyrinth…verdant crown”) is justified by the bonsai metaphoric frame and pays off in closure. Two template-cadence strings (“he…then he…”) in the final third incur −0.3, touching but not clouding the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors tide: cumulative anaphora (“Layered atop…”) builds density, then clipped fragments at label pry. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances texture or position. One mixed metaphor (“histories stacking like misaligned cargo”) is minor; no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ear-test rhythm breathes—sentence length varies, paragraph cuts tight. Information density high: one line can do image + causality (“shell’s paint flaked under vibrating pressure, colors blurring like memories”). Mixed-metaphor risk in “echoes reimagined, proving myths as self-made compasses” but coherence survives. A few template stems (“Elias… as…”) recur; not pronounced enough to obscure closure. No filter-verb stacks in climax; propulsion maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: one sentence can paint, advance plot, and foreshadow (“vines’ twists hid coordinates”). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Occasional stacked modifiers (“perpetual carnival afloat on vast interconnected rafts”) flirt with density overload but never stall the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent effort, then tightens into staccato chemical steps. Figurative language is sparse and mission-apt: “frozen tear” for the grain, “clawed shadows” for rim rock. One scaffold loop—“last” repeated three times in four lines—dulls momentum slightly but does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with task pace; no template cadence or filter stacks. Sentences multi-task: “callused hands, scarred from years of mending the world’s intricate mechanisms” delivers backstory, tactile specificity, and world-weariness in one sweep. Metaphors (mist as lover’s breath) are brief, apt, never layered to opacity. Clean copy; zero loops. High-band prose.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is clean: sentence openings vary, no template cadence; paragraphs breathe with scene tempo. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“silver scar,” “serene predator”—never stacked. Information density high: one line can sync time, tool, and temperature. Minor scaffold: “subtly confident” appears twice without fresh embodiment; not in closure zone, so −0.3 only.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is musical but repetitious: “wild hush” recurs eight times, “infinitely patient” four, producing template cadence that dulls surprise. Mixed metaphors (“wild hush deepened, charged with wild energy”) slightly blur the vehicle. Most sentences advance mood rather than multiple tasks, keeping density moderate. No artifact invades the closure, but the echoing diction blocks 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density—each sentence advances image or tactic; no paraphrase loops detected. Occasional stacked modifiers (“swirling vortex of amassed silence harvested from drowned epochs”) risk purple but serve accumulative densening, forgiven under taught pattern. One mixed metaphor: “snarled currents writhed like living serpents” alongside “tangled web” in same sentence—minor coherence wobble. Final paragraph compresses to monosyllabic beats (“She kicked upward, the orb secure”), showing rhythm control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry dual duty (e.g., “He squeezed through, the lattice scraping softly, the copperlight following like a faithful specter” compresses action, object, motif in one breath). Figurative runs are frequent but patterned (copperlight recurrence) and pay off in charged final image; no mixed metaphors. Filter-verb clusters absent; paraphrase loops not found. Minor template cadence in tripled participial openers (“Hovering faintly… Grateful shades… Through the scuffs…”) but serves ritual incantation effect at coda and does not obscure causality. Final sentence “the lighthouse prison dreamed in repose” ends on strong noun-verb pairing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure—long narcotic sentences in calm, staccato fragments at collapse. Figurative language is dense but patterned (venom/wine, ash/veil) so does not obscure causality. One paraphrase loop (“over the hush of winter-cracked fields” repeated) is forgivable as mantra. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closing rune-etcheon floor image is precise and propulsion stays high.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence runs. Some metaphor density in peak beats—“orchid solace that soothed the soul’s sharpest thorns”—but pattern is taught early and justified by poetic voice. One paraphrase loop: “broken precedents… shattered… crumbled” within three lines costs −0.2. Information density high; most lines braid image, motion, myth. Closure image (“threads of dream sewing eternity’s gentle mend”) lands clean, no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates well between long lyrical lines and short tactile bursts (“Blade struck something unyielding.”). Information density is high: one line can deliver time-jump, artifact, and symbolic freight. Minor scaffold: “excavating across hours that blurred into days” repeats temporal compression twice; “cautious enchantment” phrase recycles four times, creating template echo. Closure image is clean, but preceding paragraph holds three “time” references in four lines, dulling edge.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “ebony clipboard, its polished surface etched with faint circuits from a bygone analog era” packs three story facts (color, texture, history) in one clause. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “specters of lost childhoods” not “ghostly shadows.” No mixed metaphors; chalk heart stays within sidewalk logic. Minor loop: “dawn” appears four times in first 150 words— intentional motif, not artifact, because it culminates in “dawn’s gold deepened” charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic variety matches tension: long filament sentences for stitching flow, abrupt exclamations for feigned senility. Information density high—one sentence often layers cosmic scale, tactile detail, and social ruse simultaneously. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase echo (“echoed silence” repeated) but occurs in opening/closure resonance pattern, hence forgiven. No filter-verb stacks; actions stay kinetic. Proofing clean; no typos or homophones.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long sentences for twilight languor, fragments under decryption pressure. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Occasional stacked metaphors (“brain-like” coral + “lotus-hearted” ache) flirt with overwriting but serve pattern. Proofing clean; tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences perform expos, mood, metaphor (“branches skeletal relics of abundance”). Figurative language is patterned—light as paint, fog as canvas—paid off at closure. No mixed metaphors; scaffold limited to two near-repeats of “pensive mirth.” No loops or synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm varies sentence openers; paragraph cuts land on image turns. Minor over-modification (“centuries of thick fog that muffled the world into whispers”) keeps from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ear-test rhythm varies: long breathy sentences for dilation, staccato noun phrases for coin-flash. One paraphrase loop (“methodically playful” ×3) and a single mixed metaphor (“glass under sonic pressure”) dull edge but occur before climax; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong verbs and concrete nouns propel momentum; only minor scaffold (“chaos converged” repeated thrice) drags. Mixed metaphors are purposeful—pollen storms, ledger vines—mirroring the reality warp. One paraphrase loop (“seeds spilled forth, each a vessel for new patterns”) could compress. Otherwise dense, vivid, and read-aloud smooth; no artifact obscures the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence texture is lush but disciplined: propulsion maintained through participle-openers that mimic tidal surge. One mixed-metaphor risk—“pain’s tendrils uncoiled… leaves greening under imagined suns”—is forgiven because vegetative logic sustains the photosynthesis motif. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are clean. Occasional modifier stacks (“galaxy postcard, guardian of armistice”) flirt with density penalty yet serve incantatory effect. Closure line “Peace blossomed” lands uncluttered, sealing rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence advances either orchid handling, tube use, or emotional cost. Metaphors stay coherent—light as dawn, shards as regrets—and never stack into purple overload. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clause when wind howls, then brittle single-word sentence “Shattered.” No synonym loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long vowel-laden sentences for wonder, staccato for peril. No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphors (glyphs like brambles) stay consistent to language-forest logic. Information density high: one sentence can anchor object, emotion, and world-rule. Minor scaffold: “carefully reckless” repeated three times—acceptably thematic, not looped within adjacent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density; sentences layer action, perception, and metaphor without scaffold. Occasional ornamental stacking (“dappled resolve,” “slyly heartfelt”) nudges toward purple but stays readable. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Final line is crisp, image-driven, earns its cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.7)
    High metaphor density but pattern is taught early (“feathers blooming soft grays against the withering yellowed pages”) and paid off in final “withering tomb” inverted to “preserved life.” No mixed metaphors; sustained celestial/terrestrial braid is coherent. One paraphrase loop: “trust bloomed anew, fragile yet rooted” echoes prior bloom tropes (−0.2). Sentence variety strong; no template cadence. Opening and closing lines echo “wither/bloom” without feeling framed.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to staccato fragments; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective: “skies folded into infinite refractions” is the only extended metaphor, earned at high-stakes opening. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new texture or causal cue. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “light” images 60 words apart; otherwise propulsion is clean and closure image untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies, paragraph cuts tight; occasional luxuriant metaphor stacks (“ethereal prisms across coral-veiled spires”) risk overwriting but repay in cumulative glow. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; information density high. Closure beat free of figurative muddle. Two near-simultaneous participle openers in high-pressure beat are the lone micro-slip.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and mechanical data (“sea spray mingled with cotton candy scents” + “clamor of rigged skee-ball machines”). Few filter verbs; metaphor vehicles stay seaworthy—no mixed metaphors. One scaffold trace: “lightly attentive” is repeated three times; trims −0.2. No artifact touches closure beat; cadence lifts in the final roll-clatter image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long sentences for drift, fragments for anchor shock. Mixed metaphors avoided; lunar/ink/star vehicles stay coherent. One paraphrase loop: “obsidian grace” thrice; minimal impact. No scaffold, no synonym churn. High density: each sentence layers image + motion + internal tide. Closure image crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable—“concentric rings,” “fractal dances”—each image advances stakes or atmosphere. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay internally consistent (glass/light/water). Opening and closing lines serve as echoing brackets. Minor elevated register in “noctilucent” is voice-motivated and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    Read-aloud cadence is mostly varied; occasional “hard softness / gravelly yet warm” couples stock phrasal pairings. Overwriting Check: metaphor density peaks in celestial paragraph but pattern is taught, so only −0.2. One scaffold loop: “bargained innocence” concept restated three times without fresh angle. No mixed metaphors; spatial tracking clean. Final line achieves image resonance without syntactic sag.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is dense and propulsive—each sentence layers shell, pebble, kelp, equation—yet the lyric surge never loops or muddles; metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent (“tide-polished curves,” “needle frozen at hopeful apex”) and climax image is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: each sentence advances map, memory, or atmosphere. Occasional purple peaks (“seismic sorrow”) but metaphor obeys physical logic. One paraphrase loop—“legacy’s burden” repeated twice−0.2. No filter-verb stacks; propulsion breathes with scene tempo. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    Compressed lyrical mode teaches its pattern early (“petals unfurling like whispered secrets”) and sustains it without clutter. Mixed metaphors are controlled: terrace “echoing” and “hush” serve auditory motif. Few filter verbs; action is shown through tactile verbs (traced, dipped, poured). Occasional adjective stacks (“dusky harmony,” “prismatic hues”) risk purple, but stay purposeful to painterly hyper-saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “orphaning empires and birthing atrocities” compresses centuries into six syllables. Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—celestial dance mirrors diplomatic waltz, no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “operatively gentle” is repeated four times; while purposeful, the final instance borders mantra. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence music is taut: varied openings, no scaffold, high information density—“He’d manufactured the drought to etch this map, unwitting midwife to redemption” performs triple duty (causal admission, irony, thematic pivot). Metaphors stay physically coherent (salt/mineral register) and pay off at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new pressure or sensory layer. Copy-clean; pronouns unambiguous across single POV. Final line (“Life, perhaps, would answer”) delivers necessary exhale after dense compression without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; stacked metaphors (“flakes drifted like forgotten promises”) risk purple but stay purposeful. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Information density high—“threads dissolved to ash at her feet” does triple duty: action, image, consequence. Final line lands clean; no artifact touches closure. Minor register drift toward “conceptual repricing” language, but fits the elevated lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: each sentence layers metaphor, body, and choice. “Meteor hush” refrain risks incantatory loop but serves as pressure meter. One mixed metaphor—“vast curve swallowing the meteor hush”—barely perceptible. No filter-verb stacks; props tracked cleanly. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors tide of reflection then clipped exit.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    High figurative density is pattern-taught early (“emerald moss draped ancient boulders”) and justified by the grotto’s dream-logic. No mixed metaphors; every image obeys internal physics of light, wind, chitin. Occasional scaffold near “knot. / Each knot was deliberate” but the repetition enacts ritual cadence, not filler. Final line lands clean, no artifact drag.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence variety is high; no template cadence runs. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—every metaphor (aurora as veins, rope as serpent) returns transformed at closure. No paraphrase loops; information dual-loaded: “braids, woven by shamans to channel northern lights into tangible glow, had dimmed” conveys history, stakes, and tactile object state in one stroke. Minor overwrite in “snowmelt ardor” used thrice, but repetition accumulates thematic pressure rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, symbolic, and causal work—“Holographic scripts flickered on walls, an ancient command loop eroding bit by bit.” No scaffold loops. Metaphors are coherent; “ethereal grit” sustains without contradiction. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts land on image or revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is high-density: “lamp oil and frayed parchments” does triple job—concrete, trait, stakes. One mixed metaphor: “abyssal entity bridging mortal sight and stellar void” drifts toward abstraction but recovers with embodied “tile reset in the floor.” No scaffold loops; sentence variety controlled. Minor over-pack in middle schematics—three Latinate compounds in one line—dims clarity without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is piston-like: short percussive sentences for pin-skips, flowing long ones for grace-memory. No scaffold; each sentence advances setting, body, or tactic. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“resentment calcified grace into rigidity” lands once and matters. Zero loops, zero mixed metaphors; clarity never dulled even in honey-thick warp.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—lines perform two jobs (atmosphere + causality) without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent: fog → glass mountains → crystalline spines, each extending the same refraction conceit. No synonym loops or mixed vehicles; cadence varies to let high-pressure breath beats contract into single clauses. Opening and closure lines are ear-tested, image-anchored, free of clutter.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar grief-ghost trope is re-forged through mirror-craft cosmology and broken sextant astronomy, making the retrieval mechanism feel specific to this world and this man. Synchronized breathing as engine of manifestation is fresh, low-tech, intimate—risky yet believable under the story’s homemade physics. Risk taken with lyric repetition pays off when final line mirrors opener, reweighting orchard from loss to reunion. Without these particulars the arc would collapse; transformation is organic, not bolted on.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose carries sensory density without purple drag: “crimson fruit that dripped sweet sap onto cracked marble pews” fuses color, taste, texture, danger in one breath. Varied sentence openings avoid scaffold; only one micro-loop (“sap… sap”) noted. Figurative logic stays organic—orchard roots as generational memory—never mixed. Final line lands with crystalline cadence that recharges ribbon and eye simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: each sentence advances image or concept. Varied rhythm; short beats under pressure (“She laughed softly…”) against longer cadences. No scaffold loops; metaphors consistent (orchard = time). One mixed image—“equations of eternity swirled down the drain”—is forgiven by thematic fit. Clean grammar, vivid verbs. Closure image crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: “swirling dust motes that danced like forgotten notes” packs two jobs—sight and metaphor—without overwriting. One scaffold slip: “carefully resourceful” is repeated verbatim; a synonym or showing beat would vary. No mixed metaphors; moonlight/runle logic stays internally consistent. Density stays high; each sentence adds artifact, map fragment, or sensory charge, keeping momentum forward.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but nearly every sentence carries a modifier pair (“skeletal Ferris wheel,” “derelict carousel”) creating a lush drone that flattens peak beats. Mixed metaphors (“threads twisted logic into delight”) and synonym stacks (“blissfully aberrant,” “trapped freedom,” “unkindled solace”) recur without pattern payoff. Density is high—each line world-builds—but the cadence never accelerates under pressure, keeping tension at a single swirly pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies, propulsion high; each line advances image or action. Occasional poetic compression (“absence had leeched its substance”) is earned by context. One paraphrase loop: “fables weren’t mere stories… encoded the university’s hidden timelines” restates the same idea twice in four sentences. No mixed metaphor, no scaffold clutter; the closing paragraph’s taut cadence re-energizes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High density—each line layers image, action, stakes. Occasional stacked modifiers (“relentless storm of sound and light”) flirt with purple but serve accumulative lens. Zero loops or scaffold; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Compression is dense: “glass humming pavilion at its pinnacle” fuses setting + sound + location in five words. Figurative language is patterned (thistle-blown, star-threads) rather than ornamental scatter; no mixed metaphors at climax. Minor scaffold: “visions surged” appears twice within four lines—deduct −0.2. Closure sentence is clean, strong-verb driven, no filters.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between staccato clauses (lightning) and flowing anaphora (“whispers rose… whispers intensified… whispers promised”). Information density high: one sentence often layers weather, body, memory. No paraphrase loops; “deepening hush” recurs with escalating weight, not filler. Metaphors (shadows as conjecture keys) stay coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and clause, propelling the night walk; occasional modifier stacks (“enormous, petals of crimson, gold, and sapphire”) flirt with excess but never stall causality or cloud the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “starlight refracted off the cicada’s body, scattering into the pool’s miniature cosmos” does world, object, and metaphor in one sweep. No template cadence, no synonym loops. Peak beat—“viscous in hesitation, feathery in release”—uses compressed adjectives that match the POV’s tactile obsession. A single mixed metaphor—“shell cracking open” then “nacre smoothing”—is justified by the shell’s actual growth, so artifact is avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    High figurative density but each image serves traction: vines “curling hospitably” = safety + entrapment. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay vegetal/aerial. One paraphrase loop—“silences sprouted here…delicate buds unfurling”—but immediately justified by craft process. Filter verbs rare; action and taste keep momentum. Closing line “Silence sprouted eternal” lands as earned cadence echo, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is music-box precise; sentence openings vary, no scaffold loops. Metaphors stay coherent—glass, prisms, foam—all light-based. One mixed note: “vaulting hush” recurs enough to flirt with template cadence but remains legible. Information density is high; each line layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No artifact touches the final foam image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (“she pried open the revealed trapdoor” = action + object state change). Metaphors stay consistent—paint sloughing like molting skin mirrors the city shedding its past. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence modulates from languid orchard to crystalline stair beats without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentences vary in length and syntax. Minor loop: “loaded emptiness” appears four times without fresh inflection; “burned bridges carefully” recurs but is justified by closure. Metaphors stay coherent (embers, bellows, vines) and do not muddle physics. Scaffold minimal; no synonym churn. Information density high; each sentence advances image or concept.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often layers physical action, sensory filter, and concept (“pressure of countless schemes transmuted collectively”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (veins/veins, lattice/lattice). Near-overwrite in “azure fungi veiling the cavern ceiling” but rescued by subsequent tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from long breathy cadences to staccato fragments that echo mechanical whirs; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layers (“golden shadows stretched long”) stay physically rooted in sunset optics, avoiding mixed-metaphor clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences deliver setting, sensory data, and metaphor (“dew a verifiable portal”) without clutter. Rhythm modulates—opening with fluid participial phrases, climax moves to staccato “unsnap. Chime.”—mimicking breathless tension. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; figurative language is internally coherent (threads snag air’s fabric). Minor scaffold: “shivering bliss” repeated twice; does not touch closure and reads as deliberate incantatory echo, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is clean, vivid, high-density: one sentence often does two jobs (“dust motes dancing in slivers of afternoon sun” = sensory + foreshadows hidden motion). No loops or template cadence; varied openers and natural paragraph rhythm. Figurative language is spare and accurate (“ghostly fingerprints,” “weary sentinels”) without purple drift. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“bureaucratic tombs,” “talisman”) fits educated 1872 archivist; no mixed metaphors. Copy clean—no typos, pronoun clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion: most sentences advance image or causality (“key fit perfectly… turning with a groan”). figurative language clusters in low-action beats (lagoon arrival) and thins during key-turn, respecting pressure. Minor scaffold: “plans unraveled” thrice; “golden” used four times in 80 words near end, creating near-loop. No mixed metaphors or grammar slips; pronouns clean. Final line achieves resonant cadence without tag-clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned early (“dewdrops…like unshed tears”) and paid off at closure. No mixed metaphors; vehicles obey physical logic of mist, refraction, breath. Density high—single sentences carry image + causality + emotion. Minor scaffold: “quietly vivid” recurs 5× as intentional motif, not churn; no clarity loss at peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between short prod-punches and longer moss-draped coils, preventing monotony. Information density is high: one sentence can plant monument, name vanished species, and cue map. Three near-repeats of “mossy delight” and two “leaf after leaf” nudge paraphrase-loop territory, but the final third is clean. Metaphors stay physically coherent—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold, not artifact; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density—most sentences carry sensory, emotional, and plot information simultaneously. Two mixed metaphors: “mirrors of luminous regret” (mirror ≠ regret) and “checked gravity,” both forgivable under lyric license and do not touch the closure beat. Minor template cadence in three consecutive “she [verb]” openings during gold-mixing, but the beat is brief. No loops or synonym churn; “golden” repeats only when literally describing seams, justified by motif.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses sensation, memory, concept—e.g. “bones leveraging against gravity like variables seeking equilibrium.” Rhythm modulates with cardiac cadence, avoids template pattern; occasional Latinate stacks (“proprioceptively enhanced”) read purposeful, not purple. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay internally consistent (root/web, math/trauma). Minimal scaffolding; only micro-flaw is faintly echoing “brace harder” stem twice in closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and propulsive: every sentence moves knowledge or atmosphere; no filler scaffolding. Figurative language is spare but precise (“grinning through peeling paint,” “sound like unraveling wire”) and never clusters to blur sense. No loops, no template cadence, no register drift; technician diction remains credible. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is artifact-free: no loops, no filler, no mixed metaphors. Information density is extreme—each sentence both advances descent and reweights stakes. Rhythm accelerates into single-line staccato at rupture, then widens into plummet. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp anchors; middle paragraphs vary length to create visual fall. Only reason not 9.5 is the faint poetic register that may alienate some editors, but within this speculative mode it is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences spiral then snap short (“He hurled the shard”). Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early and paid off at mirror-shatter climax. One scaffold loop: “burnished sorrow” appears twice with only slight reweighting; else no paraphrase churn. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs propel heist beats.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mimics mechanism: short percussive bursts for gear-kiss, elongated clauses for crescendo—read-aloud ear passes. Information density high: one line can set acoustics, reveal world rule, and advance action (“box exhaled…spirals of light”). Figurative language is selective, never stacked; metaphors stay acoustic/mechanical, coherent with physics. Only micro-loop: “tinkersong wonder” repeated thrice—pattern-taught, so waived. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lines are dense and propulsive—“limestone walls wept mineral tears” does three jobs in seven words. One paraphrase loop (“resonant hush” repeated) and one mixed metaphor edge (“frozen waves” beside obsidian mirror) keep it shy of pristine 9. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero filter-verb stacks, strong verbs throughout. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature, accelerating at hinge beats.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with storm gusts, sentences vary; several near-metaphor stacks (“turbine-hum reverie… mechanical moan… turbine-humming”) verge on repetitive but serve motif. Information density high; no mixed metaphors or loops that stall closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Every sentence performs at least two jobs: “snow clung stubbornly to the branches outside, the pavilion evoked eternal fall” layers weather, setting, and metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is specific—moonlight as “kiss,” pavilion as “lover’s whispered secret.” Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines are sonic anchors: “traced the vivid swirls” vs. “Night flowers bloomed within,” forming lyrical bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density; most sentences advance either retrocognitive rules or sensory stakes. Metaphors stay internally coherent (lagoon “like reluctant flesh”), no register drift. Rhythm accelerates through parley without template cadence; a couple of near-loop phrases (“truths… long buried / hidden toll”) shave fraction. Closure line breathes cleanly, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. High density: “lanterns no longer paper but self-igniting orbs” fuses world-rule + image + stakes in one clause. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Overwriting check: two adjacent metaphors (“dust-choked streets,” “forgotten prayers”) pass because pattern taught early and paid off at lantern-crystal close. Final line lands clean, re-igniting cadence without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and informational work without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are deliberate (“aged wine laced with ash”) and internally consistent under flavor/burn motif. Only minor scaffold: “the shaving…glinting faintly in the moonlight” could drop “faintly.” No figurative muddle in the oracle climax; vehicles stay physical (wax, fog, fruit). High-band entry permitted because artifacts never touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Sentence density high: “starlight poured in unimpeded, casting prismatic halos on the frost-laced arches” packs three jobs—light, color, architecture—without padding. Figurative language is controlled: only two metaphors in the climax, both coherent (“honeyed fog,” “serene fury”). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each line advances image or causality. Copy clean: pronouns, tense, punctuation stable.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective, not stacked—ozone scent, rope “like a vein.” No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“aerie,” “gilding the spires”) risks purple but fits lyric mode. Grammar clean; pronoun and prop tracking flawless. Closure beat free of artifact. High-band polish, just shy of 8.8+ due to minor ornamental surplus.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.7)
    Metaphors are lush yet coherent—mixed stacks absent. Two adjacent near-repeats (“flourishing stillness” concept rephrased within 30 words) incur −0.3 loop penalty. Otherwise sentences propel with varied openings and strong verbs. Closing beat stays clear of figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud cadence is hypnotic; varied sentence lengths mirror spectral flicker. Metaphors (“threads on a loom”) stay consistent with textile/beekeeping lexicon. Minor scaffold: “tranquilly perceptive” recycles three times; no synonym churn in climax. Information density high—“bees etched in glass pulsed faintly” does triple work: sensory, symbolic, causal. Artifacts do not touch closure; final line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “patched-together illicit chronosurgeons” unpacks backstory, bodily stakes, and black-market tone in four words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sense or causal link. Figurative language kept lean; when it appears (“groaning oracle”) it physicalizes the capsule without clutter. Clean grammar, tense stable, pronoun reference clear despite absent named antagonists. Final line anchors cadence: “coarse, yearning, alive” triple gives tactile send-off.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong information density: “wire spiral-tight, leaves trembling” does three jobs—touch, sight, consequence. Metaphors stay coherent: stone as petrified giants, quartz veins as pulse. Repetitive stems (“brazen calm,” “gently systematic”) become template cadence; mild loop penalty. No clarity break, but rhythmic monotony dulls peak beats. Closure line “endless growth” edges toward platitude, not image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs. Information-dense lines (“scans showed neurotransmitters engineered for euphoria upon planetary reunion”) do dual exposition + character work. One metaphor stack (“bronze quiet…forgotten whispers…rainwashed stone”) early but taught and thematically coherent, not repeated in climax. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb clutter. Minor scaffold: “convergence” used thrice in closing paragraph—accept within lyrical reprise pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes—clause lengths mirror hoof-clatter vs prayer-murmur. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors (“desperate finger tracing infinity”) are precise, not stacked. Information density high: one line can fuse sensory cue, world rule, and emotional tilt. Copy-clean; no typos or tense drift. Peak beats remain vivid without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive—most sentences advance image or motive—but figurative layering is relentless (every second sentence contains metaphor or coined adjective). Mixed-metaphor risk: “wind-whispers through jagged seams mimicked lost heartbeats” offers three concurrent vehicles yet lands cleanly because the sonic layer fits setting. Repetitive stem “wild hush” becomes a drumbeat; filter-verb clusters absent. Strong read-aloud rhythm; minor trim would sharpen peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: elongated sentences for dilation, fragment-like bursts at jump. Metaphors are coherent—compass as heartbeat, silence as companion—never mixed. No loops or synonym churn; each line either advances sketch, body, or stars. Only minor scaffold: ‘echoed silence’ is repeated as deliberate motif, pattern-taught and paid off, so exempt from penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Figurative density occasionally overwrought—“frozen fang,” “brittle veins” twice—yet never muddles causality. Two metaphor clichés (“heart pounding,” “stars wheeling”) and a paraphrase loop (“sacredly playful spirit… sacredly playful even now”) stall momentum. Closure image clean. Within tolerance for elite tier, but one more revision pass advised.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm modulates with the ritual pacing; occasional stacked modifiers (“luminous absence bathed the curved dome in a glow that revealed nothing”) flirt with excess but never stall propulsion; one paraphrase-loop instance (“whispers roared silently, a luminous gale of absence”) keeps the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glyphs that pulsed faintly, like veins under obsidian skin” performs three jobs—visual, tactile, foreshadow. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor is bespoke and paid off. Rhythm modulates from cavernous cadence to feather-light rasp, accelerating at spiral-stroke. Zero scaffolding; every sentence advances knowledge or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm alternates between staccato pawn-click sentences and longer woven threads, propelling without drumbeat. Metaphors stay inside chess/labyrinth domain—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold pair (“woven hush… deepening hush”) is intentional motif-repetition, not artifact. Information density is high: each sentence advances decoding, memory, or setting. Closure sentence is clean, image-driven, no explanatory filler.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; “mist weeps on pale stone” marries weather to emotion without strain. Sentence variety: long anaphoric chant sentences for communal beats, fragmented stubs for solitary final sketch. Information density high—one line often layers echo physics, social threat, and character emotion. Figurative language peaks at closure but remains physically coherent: refracted rainbow is literal optic effect of mist + torchlight + bone surface. Read-aloud ear test passes: propulsive without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long inhale sentences build, then fragment as air runs out. Information dual-loaded—“bronze form pockmarked by eons of brine and betrayal” fuses world + backstory. Minor loop: “quilted” appears 5×; deduct −0.3. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold; props tracked cleanly (charm, statue, gears).

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence variety is strong; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught early (“lighthouse’s bellowing horn”) and paid off in the final silent beam, so density reads as accumulative texture rather than overwrite. One mixed metaphor (“pink fingers of dawn stroked the cobalt paint”) is minor. Line propulsion stays high; paragraph cuts are taut.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong density: each sentence advances coil, bone, or tide. One paraphrase loop in closing paragraph (“reverse migration flowed… steady reclaiming”) costs −0.2. Otherwise verbs are kinetic—“lashed,” “hissed,” “leapt”—and metaphors stay coherent (lodestone as compass heart). No filter-verb stacks; no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm varies from staccato calls to long tide-drawn sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; information often doubles (“sodden but intact, revealing an antique glass eye” does location and reveal in one stroke). Rhythm varies: storm fragments mirror branch thrash; longer sentence mirrors eye’s slow insertion. Mixed metaphors kept minimal—“storm-trapped moon” remains consistent with ravine sky. Minor scaffold: “psychological safety” is repeated three times; trims −0.2. No loops obscure causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breaths with ascent: longer sentences for approach, staccato prepositional runs inside fissure. Metaphors are concrete—trumpet vines, nectar-scented—never mixed. High information density: one sentence locates, times and sensorily anchors creek rise. Only micro-loop: “promised… promise” in father/dying vow sentence; does not recur. No scaffold; every paragraph advances situation or knowledge. Clean copy; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates: long breathless climbs contract to “Breath ragged” fragments under peak stress. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight as blood, lace as noose—without mixed vehicle crashes. One scaffold trace: “lacy menace” appears twice; forgiven because it recharges closure. Information density high; each sentence layers sight, tactility, and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    High information density—most sentences couple sensory data to emotional valence. Occasional modifier stacks (“honeyed amber,” “silken directive”) flirt with overwriting but stay pattern-true to alchemical voice. No loops or paraphrase beats; metaphor logic stays consistent. Closure line is clean, propulsive, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temps: long sentences for nostalgia surges, staccato bursts for roof-shatter moment. Mixed metaphors are purposeful (“arrow of light”) and internally consistent. One minor scaffold: “feral nostalgia” is repeated thrice within 60 words; the third could be pruned. Otherwise zero loops, high density, clean grammar. Artifact-free at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences deliver world (floating tea-platform), tool (crow quill), interior conflict (scars itch), and ritual stakes in one sweep. Figurative language is selective—vehicles (sigil-steam, firefly-flakes) cluster round ritual beats without drowning causality. No loops or synonym churn; pronouns track cleanly across crystal transformations. Occasional elevated diction (“verdant froth”, “crystalline burden”) is justified by ceremonial register; doesn’t obscure action sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with tension—long perfume exhale, then staccato static bursts. No template cadence; sentence openings vary from participial to noun-fragment to spondaic command. Information density high: one sentence can deliver scent chemistry, memory punch, and foreshadow conductor piano. Minor mixed metaphor—“currents to carry scents across chasms”—survives because it’s diegetically attributed to Theo’s youthful woo, not authorial slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but legible; figurative chains (“shafts of eternity’s stone,” “star-maps veined”) serve accumulative texture rather than stall beats. One paraphrase loop: “hush resounded louder… resounding hush” in closing; isolated, does not mar cadence. Strong nouns/verbs throughout (“knit,” “reefed,” “hummed”). No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long breathless sentences for count, staccato fragments for key insertion. No synonym loops; “fjord quiet” recurs with accruing tonal weight, not filler. Metaphors internally consistent—horizon as scimitar, key as ice—support rather than clutter. One micro loop: “razor edges” appears four times; forgiven because each reprise reweights meaning toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. High density: “luciferin molecules yielding energy in ecstatic surrender” delivers biology, philosophy, and stakes in one breath. Rhythm mirrors content—spore-veil sentences drift, then tighten at the rat scatter. Metaphors (“spores drifting like silent embers”) remain coherent with physical logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image, not summary. Minor alliteration (“wildfire now a forge”) is purposeful, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: patter of participles mimics rain, then compresses into staccato seat-rhymes; no template cadence. Information density is high—each graffiti line carries double duty as setting and stakes. One near-loop: “lucid contradiction” is repeated four times; the variance in context saves it from artifact, but the echo is audible. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the final image breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—glass disc “caught stray light like trapped stars”—and never clutters high-pressure beats. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the hang-up, then exhales into the next ring.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Compression is dense—lines layer job, sense, and metaphor simultaneously. Only minor loop echo (“haunted euphoria” 3×) and one scaffold clause (“as always in her craft”) dull the drum; neither touches closure. Metaphors stay coherent (viscous brew = memory liquid) and read aloud cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    High density—“baker mended boots, mechanic recited poetry” packs two jobs & beats. Occasional stacked modifiers (“desperately jocular, his quips a frantic shield”) flirt with purple but serve his panic. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Final line lands cleanly, recharging “derail” trope with new emotional freight.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sightless perception, emotional state, and world detail—“His skin, attuned to an ancient gift, absorbed languages through leaves and stones as if they were living scrolls.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Figurative language peaks at the pool but remains coherent—mirror-flat water literalizes the stillpoint without mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized into truth”) nudges toward purple but stays within POV’s mystical vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence often does world-rule, emotion, and motion—“Ink bloomed unbidden from its dried heart, a viscous starlit fluid that smelled of ozone and ancient libraries.” No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (nib=comet) is single-use and paid. One mixed-metaphor risk—“uncertainty cradled confidence like a warped gravity well holding stars”—but the physics of the setting justifies it, so clarity survives. Final line lands with imagistic punch, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long liquid sentences and single sharp fragments (“Tonight, we disrupt”); no synonym loops; metaphors (camera = relic of captured souls) stay coherent; information density high—one sentence often layers setting, emotion, and conceptual hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Volcanic tenderness burned in her chest for Theo” advances both emotion and metaphor without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—lava, obsidian, hearth—forming a coherent thermal arc. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Only a flicker of filter (“she spotted”) but immediacy recovers in the same line.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensory, symbolic and causal work—“She drummed harder on the harness’s metallic nodes, fingers blurring in a staccato rebellion that defied its monitoring hum.” Metaphors stay coherent within sonic-garden logic; no contradictory vehicles. Minor template cadence in tripled “she drummed” openers (−0.2) but pattern serves percussive intent and ceases before climax. No loops, no purple overflow; clarity intact at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrases—“celestial paths, unlocking magnetic resonance”—skirt register edge but remain legible. One paraphrase loop: “storm howled” / “storm peaked” within closing paragraph, minor. Strong sentence variety and sensory specificity propel momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    High figurative density is pattern-taught and pays off at closure; rhythm modulates with accelerating clause fragments under weave crescendo, then relaxes into short terminal sentences. No synonym loops, no filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffold in repeated “spiralingly calm,” but it functions as mantra, not artifact. Final line is clean, echoing opening diction (“cobalt dock after rain”) to create circular resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers task, image, and atmosphere (“aligned pawns on worn boards for his cluster of wide-eyed students” does triage—action, setting, character). Figurative control is tight; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “forests of second thoughts” appears twice; the reprise is purposeful but still a small loop, preventing a 9.0. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long rolling sentences for waves, staccato for rope snaps. Information dense—one sentence can carry scent, social stakes, and tool state. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or charge. Metaphors integrated: “swords sheathed in velvet” sustains combat-tenderness motif without mixed logic. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is editorial jargon, but occurs in commentary, not prose. Closing image clean, no artifact. Density high; only hairline slips keep sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do triple duty: “petals dusted the table, mingling with shavings” shows texture, stakes, and time in eight words. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the turbine/flower/blade constellation. One mixed vehicle (“curve of inevitability”) is forgiven in the rush. Final line lands with metronomic certainty, no drag.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Density high: each sentence layers image + motion + concept (“quartz turning liquid at the edges, air thickening into mist”). Metaphor strings are patterned early and paid off, avoiding clutter penalty; only minor repeat stems (“he paraphrased,” “boundaries blurred”). No paraphrase loops; rhythm varies via enjambed clauses and sentence-length modulation. Clarity intact—causal links legible despite lyric compression. Copy-clean; no typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and textures emotion (“twisted glass spires caught the reborn sun in fractured glints”). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent (molten heart, cracked glaze) and payoff-linked. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers light, sound, and motion (“golden shadows pulsed in sync”). No paraphrase loops; each chamber adds new sensory thread. Metaphors stay coherent—sound as fabric, grit as love—without mixed vehicles. Minor filler: “moved through them with a powerfully gentle grace” could lose “grace,” −0.1. Final line earns its lift.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence music alternates between short punctures (“She pierced coordinates”) and longer spiral clauses that imitate star paths; no template cadence survives past three lines. Mixed metaphors are avoided: orreries hum, curtains veil, stars drink—vehicles stay consistent with observatory lexicon. Only trace scaffold is the oft-repeated “subdued ardor” pair, but its thematic utility waives loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers image or rule: “ink distilled from rare volcanic obsidian” does triple duty as material, heritage, and metaphor. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; metaphor strings are disciplined. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, ear-tested. Minor overwriting in “mosaic of liquid jewels” and “topographic map of madness,” but these occur early and do not taint the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally strong density and forward propulsion, but stacked metaphor runs (“dust motes danced like fleeting regrets… frozen scream of light”) dilute peak beats. No loops or scaffold; pronouns clean. Final third carries mild purple tinge, barring 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong cadence control and sentence variety; only minor scaffold loops (“luminous regret” twice, “softly deliberate” thrice) but they serve motif. A few stacked modifiers (“golden auras clinging to their forms”) flirt with purple yet remain readable. No simultaneity errors or buried leads. Dense information per sentence; trims near-flab.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “starlight like forgotten jewels” appears once and pays off in the glinting tail-tip image. Information density is high—every sentence advances stance or texture. One mixed metaphor (“convictions trembled” layered with “brittle shells”) is minor; it does not obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “she pried loose a floor stone using the hourglass’s base, its frost cracking like old skin under her nails” performs three jobs—action, tactile simile, object state change. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Figurative layering is high but patterned (skin/ice/earth) and pays off in final thaw. Minor filter-verb cluster around “she scanned the room” is the only scaffold trace.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and wave-like, yet figurative layering approaches density tax in every sentence (“spectral embrace, silent symphonies”); a few mixed metaphors (“silver vein” beside “plasma surge”) mildly blur physical logic. Scaffold is light, no template cadence, but the lushness nudges toward overwriting under peak auroral description.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence is deliberate incantation; sentence variety is high, with fragment bursts that mirror glow-fractures. Metaphors occasionally layer—“lullaby veins,” “silica veins that throb with hidden fire”—creating filamentary echo but risking mixed-vehicle clutter. Information density is strong; most lines do twin duty (image + advance). Minor paraphrase loops (“blooms nod in rhythm, lullaby weaving eternal”) dull the final paragraph, keeping the piece just below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry dual duty—worldbuilding and interiority—without scaffold. Figurative language is controlled: each arboreal voice owns a single, consistent sonic metaphor. One paraphrase loop—“probable miracles” echoed three times in closing paragraph—triggers −0.2. Otherwise zero loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no synonym loops, varied sentence openings, strong verbs (“spiraled,” “punched,” “bloomed”). Occasional elevated diction (“veiled ridgeway,” “conceptual repricing”) fits mythic register without cluttering causality.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Metaphors interlace without mixed logic: fortress as womb, bolt as confession, frost as tears. Sentences layer job efficiently—description, motion, interiority—without paraphrase loops. Opening and closing lines frame with echo of “cobalt under snow,” creating textural brace. Few filter verbs; nouns stay concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from fluid participial openings to hammer-blow monosyllables at collapse. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful: “tannic heart dark as forgotten oaths” marries ink to covenant. No loops or scaffold; every paragraph advances pattern or image. A single mixed metaphor—“throne is chaff before the gale”—is minor against the overall music.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence doubles duty—information + sensation—“hologram flickered to life above the bench” advances plot while casting blue ghosts that echo reef spirits. No paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes; final sentence resolves with image that recharges “periodically eternal” motif. Only micro-slip: “conceptual integrity” in penultimate paragraph is slightly elevated diction, but immediately offset by pocket-fold action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagistic density, but metaphor pile-ups (“molten amber,” “velvet night,” “thunder cloaked in serenity”) risk purple overload in peak beats. Some template cadence (“barefoot soles… barefoot stargazer… barefoot and unyielding”) audible. No paraphrase loops or grammar slips; momentum breathes with paragraph variety.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    High-density lines do triple duty—advance plot, texture steam, reveal character. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (steam-plume glyphs). Rhythm accelerates into immersion, breathes at dawn reveal; final line lands charged image without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose shows high information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and symbolic layers (“the world narrowing to the salt spray and her hammering pulse”). Metaphors stay coherent within vegetal through-line; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: three adjectives in “quiet, talented in grafting” could compress, but does not obscure causality or dull closure. Rhythm varies; paragraph cut test passes—each graph advances knowledge or charge.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences pull double duty: “storm’s fury warping the lighthouse into a claustrophobic vortex” advances atmosphere and stakes simultaneously. Few filter verbs; strong verbs (“rifled,” “spilling,” “wove”) propel motion. One mixed metaphor cluster (“vortex” + “compressed time”) momentarily muddles physics but clears before closure. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts test clean.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “viscous ink—disappearing ink, he recognized by its faint, ethereal sheen” delivers world rule, sensory texture, and character knowledge in one clause. No synonym loops; “wind-carved” returns only to re-weight the closure image. One near-mixed metaphor (“tents whispered of endurance”) but it is brief and does not touch the final beat. Rhythm accelerates into the ink fall, then breathes out with the resumed wind, matching emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and image-rich without purple overload; sentences vary in length and openers. A few template echoes—“dizzying quiet” repeated three times—create a deliberate pulse but flirt with loop territory. Metaphors stay coherent: snow as entombment → snow as potential. Clean grammar, no scaffold sentences; one missing comma after “Tonight, surprise struck” is invisible under tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does setting, metaphor, and motive (“petals a serene inferno against the scorching sands”). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (blaze/roses/pollen as controlled fire). Final line “tranquil blaze enduring” earns its oxymoron via prior combustion imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“vibrating petals…shimmering scripts”) and pays off in closure when garden waves “bow” to calm. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor advances stakes or texture. Information density strong—single sentences often do setting, emotion, and causality simultaneously. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn in final third, keeping 9-band open.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary from meteor-splash fragments to longer ripple clauses, ear-tested aloud. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; “constellation quietude” fuses image and outcome cleanly. Density high—each line advances guilt, sound, or ink. One participle opener flagged but actions are sequential; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean and image-driven; every line advances pattern, sound, or character. Varied sentence cadence avoids algorithmic drumbeat; paragraph breaks coincide with acoustic/visual shifts. One minor scaffold: “lilac unease” is repeated three times with slight synonym churn but never derails clarity. No mixed metaphors; no closure contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences often do three jobs (set, body, metaphor). Figurative language is selective, never stacked in peak beats; “crimson fissures wept cold light” is the single high-image line at climax and it pays off. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested, the final clause—“gentle, radical, eternal”—a deliberate triad that cadences without cliché.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Premise hybridizes post-apocalyptic trope with retrocognitive relic, then focalizes through radical empathy rather than revenge—fresh angle. Tessera-as-key and rename-as-mercy are non-obvious syntheses that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to redeem the warlord is carried through without retreat; no safety-middle hedging. Specificity of the chipped azure-gold pattern, the muezzin’s aberrant mercy sermon, and the plaza’s wind-sigh prevent generic transportability.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence openings; information density is high—one sentence often layers color, sound, and motion. No scaffold loops, but two adjacent “echoes” lines paraphrase the same idea (−0.2). Metaphors stay coherent within stage-lighting logic; no mixed vehicles. One tense slip: “fruits ripening impossibly” uses participial simultaneity during a static beat—minor. Closure line is clean, image-driven, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; short paratactic bursts under exposure tension give way to longer, luminous clauses at the willow reveal. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. Minor scaffold: “fractally precise” is repeated four times with no escalating payoff; one mixed metaphor (“bending without breaking” applied to hope) blurs. No loops or paraphrase stacks obstruct clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Every sentence layers job: “traced glowing veins” maps action + setting + metaphor. No paraphrase loops; “thermal” recurs only when palette reframes stakes. Figurative control tight—fossil veins like lightning, amber grief/crimson hope—yet each vehicle returns to heat spectrum, avoiding mixed-metaphor drift. Peak beat at float avoids purple overload by grounding in sensory micro-choices: “inhaled sharply,” “feet lifted.” Minor scaffold: “emotions that float beyond sight” appears twice; second instance recharges closure so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: sentences layer action, image, and metaphor without scaffolding. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (“amber dreams,” “time’s cruel knot” recur in closing line). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay internally consistent. Minor elevation in diction (“reverberant,” “fossilized”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: most sentences advance code, pillbox, or bodily stakes. One micro-loop: “prudently daring” refrain; slight scaffold but not in closure zone. Metaphors stay coherent (snow glyphs ≠ mixed vehicle). Opening and closing lines carry echo without self-plagiarism. Rhythm supports hush tension; no simultaneity errors. Minor paraphrase adjacent on “silver hush” usages but within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates with stitch beats, then lengthens into the hush of gutters stopping. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Occasional elevated phrases (“conceptual repricing”) are brief and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “thorny blooms, stubborn relics…twisted toward phantom rains” does three jobs in nine words. No paraphrase loops; sentence lengths vary to mimic potter’s slow spin then quick press. Figurative language is disciplined—only one mixed metaphor noted. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating circular echo without template artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with oar strokes; no template churn. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“moonlight silvered the waves like spilled mercury”) and pays off in final transfer scene, avoiding overwrite penalty. One paraphrase loop: “wistfully pragmatic” appears twice in close succession; minor −0.2. Pronouns, tense, and spatial order remain clean; no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional noun-phrase stacking (“atomically reflective surface mirrored light down to molecular lattices”) approaches over-density but pattern is taught early and stays legible. No loops or synonym churn; “hum” and “tides” recur with purpose. One mixed metaphor—“brittle ice underfoot” in an aerial scene—slips but does not obscure causality. Clean grammar, pronouns tracked, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    High metaphor density but pattern-taught early (“prismatic quiet,” “rain-drops…jewels”) and pays off in closing kaleidoscope. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Minor paraphrase loop—“inevitably whimsical” x2, “thread connecting all things” x3—dulls edge slightly. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic variety and high information density; most sentences advance image or causality. Occasional purple clusters—“spatial mutiny,” “predatory jaws”—slightly overload the climax beat, but no mixed metaphors or loops obscure the final image. One scaffold: “rebellion stirred; he would play” restates intent.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and plot work (“nail…pulsing with spongey portent”). Metaphors stay coherent (fog as sponge absorbing resolve) and paid off in final image. Minor template cadence in “nervously confident” repeats; not severe enough to dull closure. Zero paraphrase loops; strong verbs (“pried,” “slotted,” “etched”) replace modifiers. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence length swells and contracts like musical phrases. Minor scaffold: “luminous” appears 6×, always modifier—creates haze but edges toward tick. Mixed metaphor once: “pixelated amnesty” marries digital & 19th-c photo yet conceptually justified by flake. No paraphrase loops; information dense. Closure line (“Disbelief lingered, but now it shone”) is crisp, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud cadence with varied sentence openings; information density high—each sentence layers image, backstory, or tactical move. Minor loop: “perceptively calm” appears four times in 700 words; “polished calm” twice—creates template echo that dulls final beats. Metaphors stay coherent (hoop = eye = boundary) and do not tangle; no scaffolding or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence can stage, reveal star ratio, and foreshadow seventh pulse.  No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge.  Metaphors stay coherent (star-pulses as heartbeats, glyphs as stellar dust).  Filter verbs minimal except where voice-motivated.  Final paragraph contains one mixed metaphor—“midnight solace had birthed eternal dawn”—slight register lift; keeps score sub-8.5.  Otherwise clean mechanics, varied cadence, precise pronoun tracking.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (action, metaphor, world-rule). No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors; “branches arching like drawn swords” is single clean vehicle. Micro-loop check clean—no paraphrase adjacent lines. Final third free of prose artifact; closure image (“seed remnants and an unguarded soul”) lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mesmerizing rhythm for two paragraphs, then collapses into template repetition: “Purposefully curious, she… / Anxious elation… / She heeded…” becomes a syntactic drumbeat eight times, dulling momentum. Mixed metaphors (“solar flares blotting the pact’s celestial sigil”) break physical logic. Overwriting clusters in visionary peaks—three metaphors per sentence—without pattern payoff. Still, no scaffold loops or synonym churn in closure beat; clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Almost every sentence performs double duty (image + motive, metaphor + causality). Only minor scaffold present (“her reckless ideal fueling…” repeats concept already shown). Minor metaphor strain when “tarnished coins” and “echo” rub shoulders, but vehicles stay physically coherent. Closure line is clean, resonant, typo-free, with strong cadential drop.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, but stacked metaphor strings (“particle shifting quantum states,” “magnetic flux lines parting”) clog several beats without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.4. Occasional scaffold stems (“His hands worked…”, “He gazed…”) create template cadence; the final third is clean, so 9+ is not disallowed. Information density is high—each sentence layers analogy and action—yet clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. “Creel’s slats parting like welcoming reeds” does triple duty: object, motion, metaphor. Information density high—one line can fuse moon-phase, identity storm, and marble underfoot. Rhythm breathes with tide; no figurative muddle at peak smelt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose achieves high density: each sentence layers setting, metaphor, and emotional charge without scaffold. Rhythm modulates—long breathy clauses for hush, staccato fragments for ignition—read-aloud ear test passes. Mixed metaphors avoided: crystal/heart permeability stays consistent. Minor tic: “hush” repeated seven times; while thematic, it edges toward template cadence but never obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences map time, guilt, and sensory jolt. One paraphrase loop—“daringly methodical” repeated—minor, capped −0.2. Metaphors stay physically coherent (ivy = accusation, bellows = lung) and do not clutter high-pressure beats. Final line propels: “He stepped into twilight…” resolves via forward motion, no summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong ear: sentence rhythms vary from humid coils to avalanching crescendo. Information-dense; steam, stains, and telepathy lines each do double duty (atmosphere + propulsion). Sparse scaffold; only “mulberry ache” risks loop but functions as pulse. One mixed metaphor—“crushing weight snuffing dream”—minor, doesn’t tangle closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from tidal cadence to needle-prick fragments without algorithmic repetition; sentence openings vary. Information density is high—each clause adds tool, sense, or stake. Metaphors stay physically coherent (skyfire, crystalline shroud) and never collapse into mixed vehicles. One near-loop: “hush within hush” is deliberate, pattern-teaching, and paid off in the final “radiant hush,” so it reads as motif, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies—from long breath of opening sentence to staccato “Sap welled, not in pain but promise.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent within vegetal logic; no mixed vehicles. The only scaffold is the triple “vineyard hush,” taught early and paid off in final whisper, so it reads as ritual refrain not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety and auditory rhythm carry the read-aloud test. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“sycamore hush” recurrence teaches lyric lens). No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Tightest line: “rings bloomed outward, concentric patterns rippling under starlight” — image + causality in one breath. Minor scaffold: “wait, overshot; trim in mind” meta-chatter is cuttable, but appears outside story body; ignore.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Metaphors are bone-stone-echo consistent; vehicles never collide. Clause variety propels the accretion: fragment (“clack-clack-clack”) then rolling anaphora (“decades layered atop centuries”). No filler, no scaffold; each sentence adds temporal or sonic layer. Only nit: “weathered resolve” appears three times—mild churn, but the phrase is buried in differing contexts and never muddies closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: information doubles (lanterns blot sky + cast ripples), metaphors stay coherent, no synonym churn. Few minor flights—“lanterns bobbed overhead like approving specters”—tip toward ornament yet serve atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies, openings avoid templates, paragraph cuts tight. No scaffold or paraphrase loops; closing line is crisp image. A handful of elevated phrases slightly exceed working-class lamplighter lexicon, registering minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, causality, or atmosphere. Metaphors are stacked (“fossil in the shrunken void”) yet stay coherent because they extend the contraction metaphor without mixed vehicles. Information density is high: “quiet enthusiasm” does emotional double-duty as trait and ironic counterpoint. A single hairline scaffold—“she listened intently” after “static bursts filled the air”—is the only near-redundancy, too minor to touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high—"scattered light dancing across the plinth" compresses visual, kinetic, and symbolic work into one clause. No synonym loops or template cadence; each monster naming uses syntactically distinct phrasing. Mixed-metaphor vigilance: "eyes like void pits" and "fins like scythes" belong to the same nautical anatomy without clashing. Final line—"The stars wheeled overhead, whispering approval"—delivers resonant closure without overreach, the only personification granted to the cosmos, earned by prior star-etched dome.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, avoid template cadence; information density high—one line layers spell-limit, body-cold, drip-count. Mixed metaphors absent; “viscous hum—essence of drowned sailors’ oaths” is precise and physically coherent. No scaffold or synonym loops; each descriptor (sapphire dew, bronze fracture, pendulum bone) appears once and recurs only when state changes. Peak beat clarity: the moment needle channels micro-channels is rendered in surgical verbs (“pierced,” “deposited”) without purple overlay. Copy-clean; no tense drift or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear shows natural cadence; sentence openings vary from participial to subject-verb without algorithmic drumbeat. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“spires like forgotten accusations” marries concrete sight to moral freight; no mixed metaphors. Information density is high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, backstory cue, and causal linkage. Scaffolding is minimal; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image, not assertion. Tense and grammar flawless; pronoun references unambiguous even when “he” could ambiguously reference either Elias or implied engineers—the context keeps antecedents clear. No buried lead; each paragraph advances either discovery or consequence. Minor tic: “precisely humane” repeated twice verbatim; its second use could have been inflected, a hairline imperfection that keeps the score just sub-9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional valence, and ritual function (“warming the crystal without shattering its glacial heart”). Metaphors are coherent—waterfall prism, vein-like roots, bridge of birds—all serving the unity motif. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. One micro-slip: “patterns through the patterns” is an eye-tempting stutter, but the second “patterns” is justified as meta-formation. Closure line “ready for what dawn would forge” lands with propulsive cadence, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with mission tempo: clipped imperative blocks during radio exchange, then cadence loosens into looping arbor lyric. Information density high—single sentences layer meteorological read, emotional stakes, and tool revision. Metaphors are sparse, consistent (“branches twisted like veins”) and never cloud physics. Minor scaffold: “soundless echo” repeated for atmospheric effect but pattern is taught early and earns final hush, so artifact stays below closure threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Propulsion strong: sentences vary, openers shift, paragraphs cut cleanly; each line advances image or stakes. Minor scaffold: repeated “Pretense shattered;” the anaphora is purposeful, not loop, so only light tap. One mixed metaphor—“history flickered wildly…storms parting like clouds”—but occurs mid-scene, not at closure, clarity intact. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym churn. Near 9-band but for two adjacent “convulse / firing in symphonic fury” that edges purple; still readable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often triple-jobs (anchors setting, advances clue, textures mood). Metaphors stay physically coherent; “storm-born silence” sets tone without mixed vehicle. One scaffold tic—“orthogonal approach” counted four times—teaches pattern early so repetition reads deliberate, not loop. No artifacts touch closure; final line is taut.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythmic control mirrors symphony swells—sentence length varies from breathless fragments to rolling clauses. Metaphors stay acoustic (winds like “restless spirits”) without mixing vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “mournfully eager” x4; creates incantation but edges toward scaffold. Information density is high—each sentence layers sound/erosion/ghost motion. No artifacts in closure beat; final line is clean, resonant, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence variety strong; clauses layer without scaffold. Metaphors occasionally stack three-deep (“veins in marble” over “fractal patterns”) but never stall the beat. No loops or paraphrase churn; information multiplies in single lines. Read-aloud rhythm propels; minor purple tinge in “stacked infinities” keeps it sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer image and motion without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “bloom iced before unfolding” keeps vegetative and thermal logic coherent. Minor loop: “each step crunching softly... each failure... each near-miss” repeats anaphoric “each” across paragraphs—acceptable as accumulative pattern but noticeable. Final line is crisp and image-driven, recharging “frozen blooms” with earned uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “perigee’s pull making each rung vibrate as if the moon gripped the metal” fuses sensory cause and stakes. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each clause advances tool, body, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—no mixed metaphors. One tiny filter-verb cluster (“she noticed”) mid-scene is acceptable under lens; no artifacts touch the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long suspension to staccato at climax, propelling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies, sentences do double duty; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are kept in check—e.g., “sideways time” is repeated but pattern-taught. One coherence slip: “phantom sands ignite in spectral flow” blurs physics of empty hourglass, but image is brief. Closing paragraph compresses into lyrical cadence that lands cleanly; no artifacts touch climax, permitting mid-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is vivid, information-dense, largely loop-free; only “somber marvel” phrase recycles four times, a micro-loop not in closure beat. Metaphors (chain petals, star wheels) stay coherent. No scaffold sentences or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally lean, but “reeling hush” recycles eight times, creating a template-cadence artifact that dulls the closure image; a −0.5 penalty applies. Mixed metaphors—“shadows pooling like forgotten sighs”—are tolerable, yet “mist parting like a hush held breath” layers abstraction atop abstraction, muddying immediacy. Sentence openings vary, but paragraph breaks every 1–2 lines fragment momentum. Information density is high when the hearing aid is handled; elsewhere, mist descriptors pad rather than advance. No typos or pronoun drift, but the looped phrase keeps the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Occasional stacked metaphors (“molecules loosening, passing through stone as if mist”) slightly blur physical logic; “crashing hush” motif repeats enough to flirt with template cadence but serves tonal glue. No scaffolding loops, but two near-simultaneous participle openers create minor simultaneity hiccup. Closure image is clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long sentences for nebula ink, staccato heartbeat counts for urgency. Metaphors stay coherent—ink galaxies mirror fractured code—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“midnight solace” repeated thrice) is purposeful motif, not scaffold. High density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information; no filler transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the echo-tunnel sequence; metaphors remain concrete and internally consistent. Occasional stacked modifiers (“sinuous passage bored through the canyon's heart by forgotten waters”) flirt with density but serve atmospheric build-up and never clog the climax. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; opening and closing lines frame and recharge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density: one sentence often delivers sensory hit, world rule, and emotional tilt—“pots levitated in lazy spirals, herbs danced in midair ballets.” Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles). Minor template cadence in tripled -ing phrases (“floating… thawing… twisting”) but never in the closure beat. No loops or synonym churn; pronoun tracking clean. Read-aloud rhythm varied.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “gears fused into xylem” collapses world-rule and stakes in four words. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “resonantly soft” repeated three times in 50 words; still, the refrain is pattern-taught and pays off in final pulse. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action; no loops obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density—“twilight draped,” “brittle hush,” “cobalt lights flickering like veins under bruised skin” does three jobs in nine words. Mixed metaphors are controlled: bruise imagery recurs with purpose. Occasional template cadence—“He sorted… He scanned… He chained…”—dulls momentum mid-scene but does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with drone launches, breathes with final pedal away.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, forward motion (“vines cascaded from cracked skylights, wildflowers nodded…fed by a spring that wept”). No paraphrase loops; each image adds new physical logic. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure—“broken thing yearning to gleam whole”—without purple drift. A single participle opener simultaneity (“Gently, he pried it free, the misting hush deepening”) is forgiven for breath. Clean copy, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is high-density poetry without purple drift: each metaphor (saddle-shaped metrics, pseudospherical cone) is exact tool-use, not ornament. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Sentence variation is deliberate—parallel anaphora taught early (“Patrons would browse unaware, as ever”) and paid off in closure. One register spike—“non-Euclidean fury”—but justified by storm imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density runs high; occasional mixed vehicle (“waves evading the shore” beside “searching fingers”) mildly blurs physics. Template cadence in triple dawn repetitions is intentional pattern, not artifact. A few adjectival stacks (“translucent bird of iridescent wings”) could tighten. Closure line hums clean, no scaffold—final hush lands.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: ribbon burn advances atmosphere, character memory, and ritual logic in three lines. No synonym churn; “cosmic hush” recurs with purpose, not loop. Mixed metaphor check clean—starlight / ribbon / lock imagery stays internally consistent. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: “brackish water that lapped at his knees” does triple duty—setting, body, stakes. Metaphors stay coherent (sky torn by fairy mischief) and never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; paragraph breaks pace the lantern’s sweep. A single near-miss: “crisp nostalgia” is abstract, but immediately grounded by apple-pie scent, so artifact kept minor.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety is strong; long lyrical cadences alternate with clipped commands to mirror tension. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors stay coherent—shards, shadows, tea leaves form interlocking glass imagery. Minor overwrite in “combative tenderness” label reused four times; slight shaving keeps it from 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences multitask—sound, sense, and forward motion. Occasional modifier stacks (“insatiably creative” thrice) flirt with overgrowth but are pruned by immediate sensory pivot. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor stays coherent within horticultural logic. A single mixed vehicle—“thread of calm amid the cascade”—barely blurs clarity; otherwise line-level craft is secure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening technique; stacked participles are avoided. High information density: one sentence can set scene, reveal tool, and signal mood (“He retrieved his tapestry needle from a velvet pouch, its steel eye glinting like a captured prism ray”). No paraphrase loops; “unrest” recurs but accrues new modifiers (lucid, coiling) that shift nuance. Metaphors stay coherent—net knots “bloated with silenced screams” preserves physical logic. The final line avoids exposition, ending on image: “quiet resolve.”

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Syntax modulates from long atmospheric openers to staccato descent clauses, mirroring the literal drop into chapel darkness. Only minor scaffold (“methodically curious” twice in close proximity) and no mixed metaphors obscure causality; the closing sentence lands clean, letting rain murmur rather than commentary speak.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with depth: clauses swell and contract as pressure meters tick. Metaphors are spare, physical, never mixed: “velvet shadow,” “gelatinous archive.” Information density high—one sentence can deliver setting, back-reference, and emotional torque. Only a single paraphrase loop (“threads bind… untangling threads”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, sensory, motive). Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Metaphors (“living ink,” “pixelated mist”) are coherent, not stacked. Rhythm varies: opening spondaic “misty courtyard” vs. final dactylic “applause from the heavens.” No filter-verb stacks. Clean grammar; pronouns track. Minor scaffold: “driftingly alert” repeated thrice—pattern-taught, hence allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or paraphrase churn; each floor marker introduces new information without redundant scaffolding. Metaphors stay coherent: “frozen dagger” spire, “captive auroras” light—no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythms vary from long auroral rolls to clipped breath-caught fragments, mirroring decryption tempo. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“ready to claim the heights”) that recharges goggles and ascent motif. Clean grammar, consistent tense, no buried leads.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers meteorological exactitude, emotional valence, and motion (“Nacreous clouds shimmered grief…”). Metaphors are coherent—clouds as tapestry threads, string as kite/aneurysm—and never mixed. Minor template cadence in “He [verb]” triple openers mid-story, but not in closure beat. No loops or synonym churn; each adjective earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences deliver setting, stake, and sensory cue (“dust sifting like stars”). Metaphors are spare and consistent—sky as captured constellations—no mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or cause. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she recognized from commissions”). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose propels: parallel “luminance” threads braid discovery and peril; sentence lengths modulate from breathy inventory to staccato activation. One scaffold loop (“glow…luminance…glow”) costs minor immediacy; no mixed metaphor or register drift. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level density high—“spectral motes,” “prismatic ghosts”—yet each image advances either frost optics or memory bleed. No synonym loops; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Mixed metaphors tightly controlled: mirrors amplify dawn, gears exhale vapor; logic holds. Final image “folded infinities” is precise, no clarity loss at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is musical and dense, with high information-to-word ratio; metaphors are congruent (orchard = thorned hope). One paraphrase loop: “strangers became family” is echoed four times without new angle. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beat. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively between long lyrical coils and short bell-clap fragments, supporting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong periodic rhythm and sensory density; occasional adjective stacks ("bruised purple into the sky") slightly overdecorate the same breath, but no mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality. Closure line is clean, high-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphor density high but patterned early (“graceless spirals,” “forgotten regrets”) and paid off at closure, escaping purple penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances setting, tool, or body. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with enjambed flick-and-hum beats, then exhales into frost lace. Minor slip—“heart thudded gracelessly” reused heart/gear simile but compressed within one clause, not pervasive.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Figurative language is selective and pattern-taught: river/foam as musical score sustains through closure. Mixed metaphors avoided; “bruised purples” is the lone cliché but serves dusk palette. Information density high: one line can anchor time, body, and metaphor. Paraphrase loops absent; only minor scaffold—“the pieces fell into place”—is earned by prior patterning. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure; no drumbeat cadence.</answer>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
    <comment>Freshest synthesis: polymer chemist + braided ravine + ephemeral foam = biodegradable emulsifier; premise is not stock eco-fiction. Chrysalis reprise transforms familiar metamorphosis trope into material proof of atonement. Risk taken with lyric, almost procedural science beats pays off in credible lab payoff. If names/places swapped, core insight still works, yet the foam-chrysalis pairing is particular enough to feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or tally. Figurative layer is sparse, pattern-taught early (“glass shards etched with titles”), paid off at bloom. No mixed metaphors; cloud-sea and slate-map stay coherent. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with anaphoric counts, then breaks into single final clause.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—description + causality: “rain-softened dunes yielding to a concealed stairwell” moves both setting and plot. Metaphors (“patterns like veins of forgotten seas”) stay precise; no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb clusters or synonym loops. Final third is clean; closure image (“dawn breaking over Kharidun, his steps lighter”) is uncluttered, propulsive, ear-tested. A single over-adorned “captured moonlight” is hairline, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence can stage, evoke, and advance (“she lifted the heaviest…perfect counterbalance”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is single, coherent. Rhythm modulates from long anaphoric listings to hammered monosyllables at climax. Minor scaffold: “vigorous tender” is repeated four times, a touch over-insistent, but the phrase is motif-level and charges the final image, so only −0.2. Closure line is crisp, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, sentences vary in length and opening. Metaphors stay physical—light as scalpel, cracks as conduits—avoiding mixed logic. Information density high: one sentence often layers mirror-action + memory + conceptual linkage. Paraphrase loops minor: “profound transformation” repeated without new facet; “quaking reverie” likewise. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical but figurative density borders overwritten: four sustained metaphors within one sentence (“serpentine grotto… forgotten thoughts… spectral facets… concealed truths”) without pressure relief. No paraphrase loops, yet stacked similes create micro-drag. Final third keeps clarity, so 9+ not disallowed, but peak-beats feel slightly perfumed rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences weld tactile action to metaphysical import (“porcelain insulator vibrating the stress cracks into motion, empathy flowing from wood to his veins”). No paraphrase loops or template cadences; sentence openings vary. One mixed-metaphor alert (“quiet thunder”) but it reads as intentional oxymoron rather than sloppiness. Rhythm breathes with escalating strum pattern, accelerating sentence pulse to match.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences do double duty: “He drew his chessboard… placed the worry stone at its heart” advances action, anchors object, foreshadows closure. No filler, no loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes—long cadence for melancholy, staccato for compass twitches. Opening and final lines are image-driven, propulsive. Hairline slip: “quiet ache for what was lost yet a spark of possibility” edges toward abstract, but is instantly rooted in stone touch.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyric density risks purple overload, yet rhythm breathes with tuner dials and held-breath pauses. Mixed-metaphor watch: “velvet hush” beside “crystalline quiet” survives because both serve synesthetic catalog. Minor scaffold: “intuitively descriptive” appears three times; trimming one would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm mirrors sway: long sentences for tide-thought, staccato fragments at bloom (“Rotting flesh…”). Metaphors stay coherent—seed veins as “hidden rivers,” platforms “heaving like breath.” One paraphrase loop late (“wisdom flowed—an undercurrent”) but it echoes title, so forgiven. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“gagged,” “clawed,” “collapsed”).

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long glides to clipped tumbles; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, pressure-placed—“liquid starlight,” “ancient ribs”—never stacked. Information density high: one sentence often handles setting, tool, and emotional cue. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause advances. Copy-clean except one comma splice that actually serves breathless pilot voice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies from staccato data logs to longer inhalations of wind description; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and apt—“containers loomed like urban canyons” serves spatial logic, not ornament. One near-loop: “rapidly adapting” appears three times in close succession, but the repetition is purposeful, mirroring the iterative sensor moves. Line propulsion is high; every paragraph advances mapping, motive, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences do multiple jobs—“Colors intensified, the borealis threading through amber veins, igniting the notations into living prisms”—propelling while painting. Figurative language is patterned (light-as-sound) so density feels purposeful, not decorative. Occasional noun-phrase stacking (“prism-faceted orbs that split vibrations into spectral cascades”) flirts with overload, but the beat is preparatory, not climactic, so clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “transposed empathy ignited” does triple duty—action, emotion, concept. Figurative language is patterned, not stacked; each metaphor (molten topaz, hornet hum) returns in altered form at closure. Rhythm accelerates with clause-fragment pairs during the swap: “He reeled... She laughed...” No synonym loops or template cadence. Copy-clean; pronoun paths unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence variety, high density (“hammering stars into blades, not just horseshoes” does three jobs). Only recurrent scaffold is “germinate” used four times—bordering on template, but echoes Thorne’s last word so pattern feels purposeful, not loop. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence earns its uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: single sentences double-duty—description + stakes + sensory hit. No loops or scaffold; each image fresh. Figurative language controlled: only two metaphors per high-pressure beat, both taught early (“mist like frozen prayers”) and paid off. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image, not exposition. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” academic phrase is POV-plausible, doesn’t blur.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and musical; most sentences dual-task (advance image + emotion). Two adjacent “raveling” phrases create mild synonym churn; another scaffold pair—“stoically sparkling” repeated—edges toward template cadence but serves as bead-signature. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay coherent. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“strung,” “flared,” “soared”) propel momentum. One simultaneity glitch: “As warp met weft, the latent sacrifice stirred” compresses cause/effect but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density—many sentences carry sensory, emotional, world data simultaneously. Rhythm breathes with escalation: clipped fragments during twist, expansive loops during parallels. One paraphrase loop: "withheld truth’s weight" echoed 3×; costs −0.2. Metaphors stay consistent (weave/fabric/thread); no mixed vehicles. Filter verbs minimal; strong verb choice predominates. Clean copy, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors (“dying heartbeat,” “captured tear”) are sparse and specific; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one line can stage action, deepen atmosphere, and foreshadow glass motif. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, providing propulsion and cadence without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary; high-pressure beats avoid figurative overload. One scaffold loop—“laughter pealing like herald bells” echoes earlier peal—adds 0.2 cost. No mixed metaphor; opening line anchors stakes; closing line crystallizes CR without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—“stories clung…like dew on spider silk” does two jobs: magnetism + fragility. Rhythm accelerates at revelation—“Suddenly, the scales ignited”—then exhales into dusk. Minor purple tint in “quietly explosive hush” is pattern-taught and paid off, forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm swells and contracts with ritual pace; sentences vary openings. One coherence hiccup: “quantified sorrow—each fractured lens etched with numerals” risks mixed metaphor—sorrow as both ledger and etching. Minor scaffold: “stormlit tower…storm-painted lightning” repeats storm- prefix twice in adjacent lines. Otherwise dense, propulsive, zero loops in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high—“notes danced, pulling motes of light”—each line advances image or causality. One near-loop: “swaddled the realm’s essence… swaddled the Heart Tree fully” is intentional motif-reinforcement, not artifact. No mixed metaphors or register drift; peak beat clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with clock ticks; paragraph lengths visually echo spiral ascent. High information density: one sentence slips setting, backstory, and foreshadowing (“Her own past mistake echoed”). Only micro-flaw: triple “crumpled” in tight span creates mild echo. Metaphors stay internally consistent (ouroboros = infinite library). Zero filter-verb stacks; props tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Varied cadence avoids template; sentence openings rotate across participial, prepositional, tactile. High density: single sentence can layer scent-memory, body-motion, and world-state (“Its scent rose, earthy and nostalgic…”). One paraphrase loop detected: “normalized into oblivion” echoes earlier “normalized its end”—minor, but knocks 0.2. Mixed metaphors absent; frost “etching the leaves silver” stays physical. No filter-verb clusters. Copy-clean except one comma splice after board-up list. Overall propulsion intact; closure image unmarred.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences modulate between crystalline nominalizations and urgent verbs. Information density high—each line carries setting data, sensorial cue, and emotional pressure. No scaffold loops; “gently meticulous” recurs only twice and pattern-pays off. Metaphors stay physics-consistent (light beams, resonance) avoiding mixed vehicles. Copy-clean; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Compressed metaphor density is taught early (“twilight bled,” “timbers groaned like weary guardians”) and paid off when the same groan frames the recorded snap, preventing figurative clutter. Sentence rhythm accelerates across false-start triad—parataxis for failures, then stacked participles for chaos: “Gasps rippled; runners froze… fists flew.” Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances choice or atmosphere. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line re-energizes “comforting unease” by reversing it—dawn now menaces. Copy-editing clean; only micro-slips (“snuff” for “snuffed”) do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: one sentence often carries glow, scent, and magnetic data without clog. Loop-screen clean except two adjacent “Lavender Bluff” repeats (−0.2). Mixed-metaphor check passes: “ribbons of emerald and violet” stays atmospheric, not kitchen-sink. Final third free of artifacts; propulsion sustained through taste-turn beats. Sentence variety strong; minor over-modification in “sweet, electric tang” is the only purple puff.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; high information density—“dial hung limp, its tumblers shattered years ago when, in a fit of denial, he had smashed it”—does triple duty. No mixed metaphors; “auroral sorrow” is singular, not stacked. One scaffold detected: “creativity flooding back like subterranean springs” is paraphrased in adjacent clause; minor, does not touch closure. Otherwise propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences during the build, then clipped “She adjusted tensions” under peak wind. Information density is high—each sentence layers task, tool, and emotional charge without scaffold. Only minor loop: “glistens cascaded… glistened fiercely” repeats the same verb twice in three lines, a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat. Metaphors stay coherent: ice as prism, bells as veins, melt as lubricant—no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    High-density sentences advance both image and causality; occasional stacked modifiers (“strangely organic tendrils uncoiled”) flirt with purple but never stall the climax; zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies: short fragments under dawn hush, longer cadences during story circle. Figurative language dense but controlled; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “sandstorm calm” phrase repeats four times; same image, no escalation—minor drag. Otherwise propulsive; each sentence advances communal decoding. Copy clean; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence openings, paragraph breaths synced with dance beats. Information density high—“each pirouette encoded a journal revelation” advances plot + character + metaphor in one line. Figurative language is patterned (web, dice, kraken) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops. Minor prop-tracking glitch: dice start on thigh-slate, later “rolled across his palm” without transfer shown—0.2 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; high density lines (“pockets of gravity, denser than the surrounding tissue, each fluctuating mysteriously like breathing voids”) perform triple duty—image, physics rule, foreshadowing. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One near-artifact: “colossal body slumped…like a forgotten monument” is familiar phrasing but functions as Elias’s occupational habit of seeing in lantern metaphors, so earns partial waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    High figurative density but patterned and justified; metaphors extend origami → river → starlight without mixing vehicles. Near-zero scaffold: no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn. Sentence variety is musical, propulsive. Indigo paper, midnight herbs, phosphorescent ripples supply concrete specificity. One soft register drift: “conceptual repricing” is an academic phrase sneaking into otherwise incantatory diction, but it does not recur in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: information-dense lines (“language long forgotten, urging her to decipher it”) do double duty—characterize Elara and foreshadow the living lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for tea-room collusion, staccato fragments under meteors. No synonym churn or template cadence; each sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed-metaphor watch is clean—buildings “groan,” wax “presses,” stars “plummet like revelations,” all legible physics. Final line lands with sonic closure: “it replied” answers the opening whisper with dialogue. Minor hedge: one “as if” simile could be cut, but it does not dull the knife.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: velvety long sentences for twilight, staccato fragments for ritual peak. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the last (“storm trapped in glass” → “spiral chamber” → “dying aurora”) without contradiction. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she sensed the whispers” fits her charmed doubt). Final line lands cleanly with no clutter: “un-chained” carries the full charge.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: description advances ritual step while layering metaphor. Figurative density is high but patterned early—aurora, marble, ink—so payoff feels earned, not piled on. No loops or scaffold; each stalactite drop recurs with shifted weight. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator jargon, not story text.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose density is high—most lines couple sensory image with causal push (“Its fractured curve... murmured fragments”). Occasional modifier stacks (“reed-blown melancholy, soft lament”) flirt with overwriting but stay within voice. No paraphrase loops; pronoun chains are clean. One mixed vehicle: “armor gleamed like frozen tears” momentarily fuses reflectivity with emotion yet does not blur action.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence starts avoid mechanical “She…”. Figurative layering heavy but thematic (ice, star, glass) and patterned early, so forgiven; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—each sentence advances ritual or reveal. Minor scaffold: “cameo” x5, “borrowed starlight” x2; repetition serves litany effect, not loop. Typos absent; pronouns clean. Final line lands crisp, recharging “borrowed starlight.”

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is strong; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with escalation. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—storm and radio metaphors interweave without mixed-logic violations. A few scaffold stems (“frequencies that danced like fireflies in a gale…allegiances that twisted like storm winds”) create template echo; not severe enough to obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb clusters. Copy is clean; tightening two adjacent similes would lift it to 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers sense, metaphor, and forward motion. Mixed-metaphor risk (“melody frail as spider silk…edges jagged like broken glass”) stays coherent within poet’s perception. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts clean. Minor purple puff (“rose-gold light,” “auroras within the glass”) but it pays off in closure glow. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: each sentence layers action, weather, and magnetic physics without pad. Two adjacent “patience/wild” loops repeat concept sans new image—minor loop artifact. Metaphors stay coherent (ice-pane, oiled veins); no closure-line clutter. Overall propulsive, varied cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density—“subterranean veins pulsing with water” packs metaphor + transit body + flood risk. One template cadence around “entangled memories” (three opens in five lines) slightly drums. No mixed metaphors; rain-to-drought reversal stays consistent. Closure sentence clean: “her guide to unbreakable resolve” avoids preach by staying in physical motion.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is textured yet efficient; mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional loftiness (“vibrant hush,” “ethereal tinkles”) flirts with purple but stays in-character for a chaplain poetically inclined. One paraphrase loop around “aptly deliberate” appears three times; minor scaffold. Rhythm modulates well across short/long sentences; no drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines carry triple duty: “acid sea… gnawed… drunk philosopher” seeds world, tone, and stakes in one breath. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors remain coherent—acid as entropy, bell as silent cost. Final paragraph varies paragraph length to mimic ascending rhythm; zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is mostly lean, but minor scaffold loops (“echo of forgotten songs” used twice) and one mixed metaphor (“glitch in the matrix of loss”) dull the final third; high info density elsewhere and strong open/close cadence keep artifact damage contained.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences of orchard description to staccato parley exchanges, propelling without template cadence. Information density high: single sentence often layers sensory cue, world rule, and micro-action. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors in climax; “orbiting shards” logically extends knitting-light conceit. Minor paraphrase loop on “empathy onto action” phrase twice in closing beats (−0.2), preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length; opening anchors voice and stake, final line resolves by image. No paraphrase loops; “windborne solace” recurs with reweighted meaning, not redundancy. Metaphors (lace like forgotten promises, floes like chimes) stay coherent, never mixed. High density: one sentence often advances atmosphere + interiority + plot. Only micro-slip: “changed” used twice in first/last paras—intentional echo, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes: longer serpentine sentences inside pavilion, then clipped sunrise stride. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor pile-ups in peak beats. Information density high: single sentence often layers sensory detail, backstory hint, and emotional charge (“steam carrying notes of clove and destiny’s quiet ache”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; “mismatch” recurs but reweights each time, earning its repetitions.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is almost immaculate: high information density, no scaffold loops, metaphors stay coherent. Occasional stacked epithets (“whisperfield calm,” “kinetic parapet”) flirt with purple but serve the liturgical cadence. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp, the latter recharging “edges, not centers” as an after-echo. One mixed metaphor (“echo amplifying softly”) is a hairline slip that keeps it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density—each sentence layers scent, color, motion; metaphor strings (lavender conspirator, patient fingers) stay coherent within whimsy register. Minor template cadence in “arcs” repetition but it serves pattern-teaching and does not dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm modulates: long clauses mimic hush, then staccato fragments mirror fractured sequences. Information density high—each sensory detail also advances pattern recognition. No loops or scaffold; figurative language spikes only during sonic torrents where it is earned. Final line “Forever growing, silently” acts as resonant hinge without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Figurative density is high but patterned: every metaphor is refuse-sculptural—“tape spools for eyes,” “decayed petals” of cassette shells—so overload reads as world-logic, not purple. Rhythm modulates: tidal cadence mirrors longing, then clipped fragments when visions snap. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal grain. Only hairline slip: “tidal longing” repeated twice within eight lines; minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no algorithmic cadence. High information density—single line often carries sensory, emotional, and technical data. Figurative language is patterned: moon/pearl, vortex, papery sigh—each revisited and paid off, so density is earned. Minor loop: “luminous ache” repeated thrice; residual charge just avoids artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, sentences vary; only one paraphrase loop (“pulsing stillness” echoed twice) costs −0.2. Metaphors (vinyl=fault lines, sunlit threads) stay coherent and scene-anchored. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold clutter. Density high: single sentence often layers scent, memory, and motion. Closure line breathes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; every sentence advances image or causality. Information density high: one sentence can stitch sensory detail, world-rule, and interior shift. Figurative control under climax: “tooth fused seamlessly, its cleft sealing into a flawless pearl” is literal payoff of metaphor chain. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts surgical—remove any and the ritual sequence collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Its surface yielding to reveal an inner reflectively vibrant glow” advances both polish progress and metaphor. No loops or synonym churn; “reflectively vibrant” is mandated element, not filler. Metaphors stay physically coherent—glass veins, starlight petals—no mixed logic. Opening and closing lines are razor-sharp, bookending mist and bloom without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath “honeyed hush enveloped everything” vs. clipped “She stepped closer.” No synonym loops; “drip” recurs but each time carries new physical consequence. Mixed-metaphor risk “silicon bones” is allowed by SF setting logic. Information density high: pendant history compressed in three lines that also reveal motive. Minor filter verb stack “she studied” could trim, but beat remains immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic variation; sentences modulate from languid fog eddies to staccato cameo captures. Information density high: each sentence advances image or ritual step. Metaphors stay coherent (shell as chalice, mist as undertow). Minor scaffold: “against the current” phrase repeated five times; while thematic, the drumbeat edges toward template cadence but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for stillness, staccato fragments during ignition. Zero loops or scaffold; information density high (“lunar salts and auric distillates” does worldwork). One mixed metaphor (“apple cores formed nebulae”) but clarity intact; no artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences do triple duty—image, motion, concept—yet remain orally clean; only one soft loop (“echoes harvested thickened”) repeats across adjacent lines. Metaphors stay consistent to light/sound physics; no mixed vehicles. A single filter stack (“he noted how the sound waves grazed”) is voice-motivated and brief; clarity never blurs, so closure image hits unfiltered.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work. Rhythm modulates—long breathless coils vs. clipped “calcify” imperative—without algorithmic pattern. One paraphrase loop (“shingled hush” echoed thrice in 50 words) but does not stall closure. Metaphors internally coherent; no mixed vehicle collisions.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear varies naturally; no template cadence. Sentences carry double duty: “He’d discovered its method by accident: each turn reeled in a shard of story from the air” advances plot and texture. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—every clause adds camera mechanics, sensory cue, or causal linkage. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“Capturing nothing but sky”) that recharges earlier camera motif.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses setting, tool, and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are spare and consistent. Minor over-modification: “vast halls” + “cracked ferrocrete” + “relic of interstellar dreams” in same breath. Clean grammar, precise verbs. Closure image uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only “excruciatingly gentle” is repeated, but it is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Metaphors stay coherent—crystals as “living oracle,” hush as “ice”—without mixed vehicles. High density: one sentence often layers time, sense, and metaphor (“Petrichor nostalgia saturated the air after the night's gentle rain, evoking the earthy scent of forgotten promises”). No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs drive clauses. A single adjectival stack (“dust-veiled and mechanism-stilled”) is justified by the music box’s frozen state.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“mist clung… unspoken regrets”). Mixed metaphors absent; vehicles stay consistent (time/sundial/light). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Occasional elevated diction (“serene upheaval”) is earned by pattern, not register drift. Closure line pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety is strong, but occasional poetic pile-up (“oceanic hush cradling their secret”) slightly overdresses the final beat. No paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent—lightning glass as revelation, kelp as philosophy. A single scaffold phrase—“infinitely patient” repeated four times—edges toward mantra; trimming one instance would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is high-density lyrical without clutter: each sentence layers image and motion (“steam whispering like a lover’s sigh” does two jobs). No paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent—bird’s wing “stunted” literalizes the conceptual flaw. Rhythm accelerates into the hatch, then fractures into shorter clauses as stalactites crack, matching pressure. One mixed-metaphor alert: “forge of progress” beside “sterile forge” is forgivable echo, not muddle. Closure line (“dawn of fragile hope”) is compact, earned, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with task: long aquatic clauses drift, then staccato verb bursts for drilling/binding. Information density high—one line can carry sand memory, paternal legacy, and drainage chemistry. No scaffolding loops; metaphors stay internally consistent (volcanic grit = pulverized midnight). Only micro-deduction: “unyielding compassion” is therapy-speak intrusion amid otherwise visceral diction, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with deliberate enjambement across sentences; paragraph lengths visually mirror the slow accrual. Occasional stacked modifiers (“imprisoned hues of crimson, azure, and gold”) flirt with density penalty but pattern is taught early and pays off in final flood of color. No synonym loops or template cadence; scaffolding is minimal. One mixed metaphor—“temporal adhesive”—is forgiven at closure because it is reified by the key of solidified water.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “gear…brass teeth worn smooth by millennia” does world, history, and object age in one phrase. Metaphor strings are sparse and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long breaths for drift, staccato for pings. One minor loop: “quiet sigh of falling petals” repeated four times; because it accumulates mantra-like pressure and re-enters the final cadence, waive artifact penalty. Clause architecture varies; no scaffold clauses. Opening and closing lines re-charge the sigh/ping motif symmetrically.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentence rhythm mimics chisel taps: “He retraced. / From the central fountain… / to the shadowed alcove…” Variation in paragraph length mirrors the migration’s pulse—short bursts at arrival, longer lyrical sweeps during reflection. No scaffold; every clause advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, deliberate—“shattered memories,” “river pouring through”—never clutters. Filter verbs excised in favor of embodied perception. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line crystallizes earned poise without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Metaphors are disciplined: “froth that hissed like damned souls” sustains the surf=hell motif without mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. Information density excellent—one sentence can anchor tide, body, and moral ledger. Minor scaffolding: “ethically diligent heart” and “searing reverie” repeat verbatim; a paraphrase loop at “incremental absolution taunted him… incremental absolution accelerated.” These loops do not obscure causality or dull the final image, so the −0.3 non-closure cap is applied. Proofing clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; most sentences dual-load atmosphere and plot advance. Occasional purple clusters (“velveteen gloom” thrice) flirt with over-figuration but stay pattern-driven. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; metaphor vehicles (chess, tapestry, garden) stay internally coherent. Final line achieves chilling clarity without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion and information density: one sentence often layers model, stakes, and sensory detail. Minor loop: “feathers of discarded drafts littering the floor like fallen stars” echoes prior “fallen stars” image; deduct −0.2. No mixed metaphors; volcanic glass / frozen lake opposition stays coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line gives resonant image without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: one sentence often delivers sensory data, emotional tint, and world rule. Figurative language is patterned—thistle, ember, luminous—teaching the reader its lexicon early. Only minor scaffold: occasional triple adjective clusters (‘tiny prisms that mimicked stars’) that slightly dilute peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent (ash ↔ memory, vanishing point ↔ death) and do not crowd high-pressure beats. Information density is high: one line can set, act, and philosophize (“embers curled, reducing likeness to brittle remnants”). Opening and final lines both carry image and stake. Minor over-modification (“kinetic elegy to his mother’s final days”) but clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Information-dense without clutter: every noun (astrolabes, logbooks, sewer wire) does double world-and-character work. No mixed metaphors; “brass tooth” and “false heartbeats” extend consistent biomechanical motif. Rhythm accelerates during dig—short clauses mimic frantic sifting—then exhales at final tick. One minor loop: “abrasive calm” appears three times; because it is later etched, the repetition is earned, but still noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm modulates from languid opening clauses to the final monosyllabic “braid.” Figurative language is dense but purposeful, never crowding causality. Minor scaffold: “expectantly resigned” appears three times; “traveled stillness” twice. No mixed metaphors or loops in the closure beat. Strong read-aloud cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive, each sentence layering scent, color, or memory. One paraphrase loop—“prune… pruning… pruned” across adjacent clauses—dulls momentum mid-peak. Mixed metaphor (“cosmic prune of their own”) is fleeting. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud ready; the final line snaps shut with culinary menace.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “nectar dusk settled… like spilled honey” does triple duty—setting, tone, character lens. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent within bio-electric bee logic; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates into the final climb without monotony. One near-overwrite: “thick and golden” repeats honeyed idea, but the echo serves tonal layering rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence is musical, but metaphor density borders on purple: three layered vehicles in one sentence (“cherry blossoms drifted like forgotten sighs… violet hush of early evening”) slows propulsion. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or mythos. Tense and pronoun references remain stable. The final paragraph risks list-like litany—“Marbles, cups, ribbons multiplied”—but the anaphora serves ritual pulse, so artifact is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero scaffolding or synonym loops; each sentence advances image, motive, or causality. Mixed-metaphor guard passes: “gentle scalpel” and “silk through defenses” share surgical/soft duality that fits Thalor’s incisive kindness. High information density—single sentences deliver setting, stake, and sensory hit (“foxglove-stained glass ampoule gleamed, its purple-veined facets etched with warnings”). Final line cadence slows into resonant monosyllables—“whispering life anew”—providing closure image without editorial nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose propels: high information density via verb-driven clauses—“integrated over infinite paths, showing equilibrium in disequilibrium.” No loops or synonym churn; metaphor stacks brief, taught early (“golden mean helix”). Minor register drift into “quantum fluctuations scaled to macro” but fits POV’s academic reach. Closure image—“rolled the chipped die once more—five”—remains crisp, unmuddled.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—moonlight as both literal beam and narrative projector—taught early and paid off. No mixed metaphors; saffron diffusing in broth perfectly marries color and comfort. High information density: one line often paints time, pigment, and emotional temperature simultaneously. Only hairline slip is occasional adjective stacking (“smog-choked city”), but it suits the painter’s synesthetic gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm reads aloud cleanly; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe with beats. Occasional stacked metaphors (“rosewater dread perfumed the air, a delicate floral haze…”) flirt with density but pattern is taught early and paid off at tomb-rosewater close. No filter-verb clusters, no loops; information dual-loaded (“skeletal forests awaiting spring’s cruel kiss” paints scene and foreshadows thaw). Final line lands with sonic punch: “Veilfall roared on, guardian of ghosts.”

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors stay coherent (tide as breath, beam as skeptical eye). No loops or scaffold detected. Occasional stacked modifiers—“counter-clockwise precision,” “latent radiance”—approach purple but serve cadence. Final shard-image is clean, high-impact. A 0.3 trim could remove two adjectives without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines: “mirrors weep mercury tears” does image + plot + emotional reweight in five words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances glow, shame, or tactic. Mixed metaphors avoided—vehicles stay optical/organic. Opening and closing lines echo “luminance” vs “shadows,” creating taught pattern payoff. Minor −0.2 for two adjective stacks (“grotesque parodies,” “alluringly hideous”) but they compress contradictory allure, so artifact doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative chains (“sapphire shards,” “bruised sky”) accrete like the harmonic layers they describe. No template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed metaphor risk—“thunderous applause gone wrong”—but context keeps it legible. Final paragraph slows cadence to match spent pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence shapes, high density. A few luxuriant compounds (“sunwashed dread,” “silent storm amid the sunwashed haze”) verge on writerly, but they pattern-teach the tone early and stay consistent; no mixed metaphors, no loops.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: single sentences often fuse action, metaphor, and backstory (“ivy had overgrown…turning atrocity into necessary sacrifice”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (ivy = myth, petal = illusion). Occasional stacked modifiers (“emotionally rational guardian”) lightly purple but within narrator lexicon. Closure image crisp, no artifact touch.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, propelling the dive, struggle, inscription, ascent. Figurative layer is dense yet purposeful: “waves…whispered forgotten histories” teaches the lyric register early and pays off in the final hush. No paraphrase loops; each mortar swipe, ink dip, or gasp advances stakes. A single mixed metaphor—“hushed blaze”—survives because it is motif-taught and reprised at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “shadows clung to sodden shelves like forgotten regrets” packs setting + mood + metaphor in one stroke. Varied sentence rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she sensed…”) mid-scene costs a hair. No mixed metaphors; submarine logic stays coherent. Final line lands with crisp, image-driven snap.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, cadenced, yet propulsive; sentences vary from incense-long to crease-short. Figurative density is high but patterned—light, paper, flight—never muddled; no mixed metaphors. Information density strong: each sentence advances image, memory, or action. Minor scaffold: one “luminous” appears three times in 30 lines; does not dull closure, but keeps this from 9-band apex.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variation propels: long sensory clauses collapse into staccato sparks “Sparks flew, consoles died, breakers tripped.” No loops or synonym churn; each line either advances hunt or deepens atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled—“mist-made stone” is one vivid coinage, not cascade. One stray “vacuum energy resonances” edges toward jargon, but immediately grounded by her misidentifying it as cursed relic.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary opening and length; no template cadence detected. Information density is high—one line often delivers scene, tool, and emotion: “She activated her drone swarm with a wrist flick, two dozen pinprick lights bursting from launch tubes into the dusk sky.” Metaphors (“dome cracked open like an eyeless socket”) are exact and non-contradictory. Zero paraphrase loops. Opening and closing lines book-end with image echo without scaffolding. Micro-hedge: “brilliant dimness” is repeated four times; the pattern is taught early and pays off, so it reads as motif, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is evocative yet lean, with high information density; most sentences perform double duty (action + atmosphere). A few soft paraphrase pairs—“guilt clung… regret tempered,” “sieved hush fell… filtered silence born”—slightly cushion urgency. Figurative language is mostly consistent, but “salt spray” and “bones of drowned ships” flirt with seaside cliché. Closure sentence “Elias Thorne found not absolution, but the resolve…” is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract as moon nears quarter-mark, mirroring tension. Metaphors stay coherent (moonlight catches engravings; mist beads like unshed tears). No synonym loops or filler stacks. One paraphrase loop (“furrowed hush” repeated) mild enough to keep propulsion. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—image, backstory, foreshadowing. Only prose artifact is the triple “merrily melancholic” within 80 words in the final third; it slightly dulls the closure beat. Otherwise zero loops, no mixed metaphors, syntax varies with wave rhythm. Final line “Dawn crept, faith steady at last” is a crisp, propulsive cadence close.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with concrete nouns or prepositional plunges that mimic descent. One paraphrase loop (“jaded wonder” repeated three times) triggers −0.2. Mixed metaphor “clean slate smeared with ghosts” is earned by premise. No scaffold, no template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Minor typo-risk: “post her own” needs hyphen, not enough to obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid, but metaphor density peaks mid-ritual: “vapors rose, laced with the scent…threading through blooming boughs” stacks three vehicles in one breath. No synonym loops or template cadence runs; spatial tracking clean. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Final line (“they ran—bound beyond death”) lands crisp, earning read-aloud punch.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Metaphors are dense but patterned—each returns to breath/body: bruised lung, velvet noose, milk-warm dawns—supporting the choking beauty theme. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered direct: “dew-slick moss” not “she felt moss that was slick.” Closing paragraph’s syntactic shortening propels descent. One strained image—“galaxy undimmed by theft”—but occurs after climax and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: one sentence often jobs—image, memory, and causality. No loops or scaffold; repetition (“stitch…stitch…”) is patterned and paid off. Metaphors stay coherent (tapestry, quilt, dandelion seed). Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with shorter beats during shadow lunges, then lengthens for the final portal yawning. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and musical—many sentences carry triple duty: atmosphere, sensory ground, metaphor. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (bugs as bottled stars → actual constellation). Occasional elevated phrasing—“conceptual repricing,” “celestial flux”—skirts register drift but remains within mythic register already established. Final lines achieve charged poise without artifact; qualifies for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene temperature; no template cadence detected. Metaphors (“thief in velvet gloves”) are spare, never stacked. High information density—each sentence layers light, code, motive. Only minor loop risk: “winking hush” echoed four times; yet it re-weights at closure, earning its recurrence. No clarity or causality obscured; prose propels.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Metaphors stay coherent—“living smoke,” “veils of promise”—no mixed vehicles. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; information density high (“dust shimmered with trapped infinities, particles of a dead sun”). Occasional elevated register (“incarnate,” “proxy”) is voice-motivated for a pattern-seer; no clarity loss at closure. Peak beat remains propulsive, final line breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence music is controlled: varied lengths, tactile verbs (“pried,” “scraped,” “whispered”). Occasional purple peaks—“dignified chaos where intellects would fence”—but metaphor stays coherent within light-and-blade lexicon. No scaffold loops; each line advances image or tactic. Minor simultaneity hiccup: “While waiting had birthed revelation, their duel transformed...” compresses two time strata into one beat, but sense remains recoverable.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence openings vary; high-pressure beats drop modifiers for punch: “Guards passed indifferently.” No mixed metaphors; moonlight stays consistently shard/lantern without violating physics. Information density strong—one line can layer ash-dust, book title, and political back-story. Two adjacent “bloom/blooming” uses are near-looped but spaced enough to avoid scaffold penalty; they actually escalate motif, not redundancy. Read-aloud cadence propels without purple drift; final line lands clean, recharging “sky” motif introduced in title-line.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong density—one sentence often layers setting, metaphor, and bodily risk (“foam that shimmered like lost stars” does triple duty). Rhythm accelerates naturally up the arbor, then breathes at the glade. Minor filter-verb cluster in “he began the encore” could tighten, but the beat is salvaged by tactile follow-through—“fingers trembled only once.” No mixed metaphors; clock-winding and reel-spooling stay mechanically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythm and information density: most sentences advance image or concept. Occasional ornamental stacks (“luminous petals unfurled… casting a golden haze that flickered like fireflies in doubt”) border on purple but serve tone. No scaffold loops; only minor paraphrase echo (“luminous doubt” repeated) that charges closure, hence allowed. Metaphors stay coherent within fantasy botany; no mixed vehicles. Closure line clean.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence openings; high density—“snip overgrown limbs symbolizing her silence” performs plot + symbol + emotion in one sweep. Mixed-metaphor vigilance maintained: compass needle quivers to “phantom winds” yet stays physically coherent. No loops; “rhythmically placid” recurs intentionally as tidal heartbeat. Minor scaffold: “diffused” appears three times in 50 words mid-story (−0.2), but never touches closure beat. Final line is artifact-free and propels off the page.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “preprocesses reality” appears three times as a near-verbatim refrain, creating a scaffold loop. Figurative density is high in peak beats (e.g., “decay’s gentle hand”), risking muddle. Sentence openings vary well, and information density is strong—most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere. However, the repetitive use of “preprocesses reality” as a conceptual anchor feels more like a label than an evolving insight, triggering a −0.6 artifact penalty that caps 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“blinding resonance,” “ephemeral maps”). Sentence openings vary well, but mid-story has minor synonym churn (“steadily adaptive” repeated, “resonance” overused). No fatal loops, but two adjacent lines restate frost’s role in tracking. Closure beat remains clear despite slight figurative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frost-veiled pane caused faint heat blooms” does triple duty (setting, method, emotion). Figurative language is consistent—thermal metaphors never contradict. Minor overwriting in “unshaken marvels” repetition (three mentions), but payoff justifies it. Final paragraph’s cadence (“silence no longer void but vessel”) earns its lyricism without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fractures mirror spirit, light as signal/rest) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in early paragraphs (“drowned tomes swelled with eternal silence”) borders on purple but serves tone. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally. Final lines crystallize momentum without slack: “rest, addressed forever in the deep” lands with syntactic and conceptual precision.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “starlight like threads of forgotten hope,” “lanterns bobbing like malevolent fireflies.” Sentences vary rhythmically, advancing atmosphere and plot. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“heart pounding,” “thrill cementing loyalty”) edges toward cliché but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; every line serves momentum. Final paragraph’s cadence (“gently, eternally”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“petals drifting in the foggy lucidity of dusk” sets tone while anchoring setting). Figurative language is pattern-taught (sparks, fog, inversion) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“ethereal, haloed in violet wisteria glow”) risks purple prose but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs—slower for projection, quicker for healing climax.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously. Rhythm varies effectively, though occasional overwriting (“verdant labyrinth pulsing with sap like veins of forgotten epochs”) risks figurative saturation. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; closure beat (“free at last… designer reborn”) avoids artifact. One minor redundancy: “quaking reverie” and “trembled in quaking reverie” echo too closely early on.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information yield per line. Sentence rhythm varies effectively—longer, flowing phrases for vigilance; staccato bursts during attack. Minor overwriting in opening (“shadowed husk,” “forgotten dreams”) risks purple prose, but quickly grounds in concrete action. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (chains as old skin, Wall as behemoth). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors poise amid chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and plot (“bioluminescent apple boughs that pulsed like forgotten heartbeats”). Figurative language is consistent—sound-as-color, silence-as-substance—without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-forge (“aurora coruscating overhead… shivering greens and violets”) slightly dilutes momentum, but closure beat (“crystalline snap cascading into abyssal hush”) achieves perfect clarity. No loops or scaffolding; every image earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“her sharp mind decoding whispers others missed”). Sentence openings vary (“Slipping past velvet ropes…”, “Luminous disbelief washed over her…”), and paragraph lengths create rhythmic tension. Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (“lips parted as if whispering fate’s secrets” borders on strained), and “luminous disbelief” repeats slightly, but these don’t obscure causality. Final line (“her world reinterpreted itself whole”) earns its lyricism through accumulated imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (“veins awakening,” “liquid fire,” “molten soul”), risking density overload. Mixed metaphors (“forge sanctuaries,” “bastion 'gainst inquiry's foes”) strain coherence. Template cadence emerges in Elias’s proclamations (“Behold!”, “Lo!”, “Breathe life…”), creating rhythmic predictability. While vivid, the line-level craft occasionally prioritizes lyricism over propulsion, dulling the closure beat’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-ornamented (“constellations piercing the gloom like accusatory eyes,” “waves over gravel”). Minor redundancy in “trembling certainty” repeated near climax. Sentence variety sustains momentum, though one or two stacked metaphors blur clarity (“veined with iridescent whispers”). Final paragraph tightens effectively, with strong verbs (“lunged,” “snaring,” “shoving”) carrying propulsion. No fatal artifacts, but slight density drag in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but purposeful—each metaphor (“resin trapping forgotten echoes,” “bruised violet” sky) advances atmosphere or concept. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (stacked modifiers), but payoff justifies it. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Winds howled…”, “He was…”, “Outside…”). Final lines (“ambered silence sealed their pact”) earn lyric closure without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “snowflakes dancing... as if alive with unspoken secrets” conveys atmosphere, character perception, and thematic foreshadowing in one clause. Sentence openings vary (“His chassis gleamed,” “Buried beneath,” “Time folded”), avoiding template cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“haunting note resonated, slicing through twilight hush like a thought piercing silence”) risks mixed metaphor but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or texture. Closure beat (“broom whispered onward”) earns its lyricism through prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors cohere (crystals as mirrors, hearts as glass) without muddle. Sentence variety supports momentum, though occasional overwriting occurs (“symphony too soft for words, perfect for secrets”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but density peaks risk opacity—e.g., “ambiguously clear” appears three times, verging on motif-as-mantra. Final lines land cleanly, with “shared silence” echoing the opening hush to satisfying effect.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “crimson roses thrusting defiantly from tendrils shriveled by neglect” establishes tone and conflict in one stroke. Figurative language is coherent (marble cracks as “veins of defeat”) and payoff-driven. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“bruised with dusk,” “paradox of blooming opulence”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, setting, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “tools humming softly, infused with the steady pulse of recycled starlight”). Minor overwriting in climax (“myriad projections blooming like frozen auroras”) borders on purple but serves thematic aurora motif. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One near-redundancy: “twilight yielded to the restful night” slightly echoes prior “hush” imagery, but not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “water sluicing from its yellowed pages, revealing faint images where ink had bled and reformed”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (water as revealer/destroyer) and payoff-earned. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One near-miss: “flooded echoes faded, but inspiration endured” edges toward summary, though rescued by preceding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—“gales carved auroral sorrow,” “pulp had lodged deep, a stone in her gut.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (aurora = sorrow, smudge = truth) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “veins like lightning, petals edged in deceptive delicacy”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final line (“carried into the swaying dawn”) masterfully recharges core motif.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “boots crunching gravel,” “beads snapping free like absolution beads” do double duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and charge. One minor redundancy: “drowsy alertness” appears three times, but the third use crystallizes the tone at climax, justifying recurrence. No scaffold loops or purple prose; figurative language is coherent and payoff-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and purposeful, with high information density (e.g., “pages yellowing into serenity”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (paper/earth metaphors) and coheres physically (soil parts like pages). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“cryptic folds that hummed with latent secrets”) slightly blurs immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves with rhythmic precision. One near-paraphrase (“crumbling peace” repeated) costs 0.5, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten: “cautious exuberance” appears three times, and metaphors like “dreaming roots” repeat without evolution. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density peaks during the eclipse (“twilight’s embrace,” “ethereal half-light”) risk blurring clarity. Sentence variety is strong, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. However, “softly adaptive” functions as a label—used four times without demonstrating tradeoffs in action—triggering mild scaffold penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but never sluggish; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or mystery. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“bronze quiet,” “dust motes spiral lazily upward”) and pays off in the final image. Minor overwriting in “fevered life—a librarian who had chased the same axis-born anomalies” slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors mar peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly lean, with high information density (e.g., “spycraft microdot film specs—a thumbnail-sized strip...”). Rhythm varies effectively, though a few overwrought phrases (“symphony shifted to a minor key”) flirt with purple prose. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Deduction for slight figurative excess in climax (“orchestrated flawlessly... chaos converging like notes”), which briefly dulls immediacy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“silences decorating like frost on glass”). Minor overwriting appears in mid-section (“metaphor spiraled, a chiasmus forming…”) where figurative layering risks muddle, though never obscures causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports cadence. Closure beat remains clear, but one or two adjacent lines flirt with purple prose, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“silence pooled like spilled mercury” establishes tone, setting, and metaphor in one stroke), though occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“upturned hush” recurs three times with diminishing returns). Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor scaffold detected: “chronologically homesick” is repeated verbatim twice instead of evolving phrasing. No loops or simultaneity errors, but the third use of “upturned hush” in the climax borders on motif fatigue, slightly dulling the closure beat’s uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “puddles below shimmered, each droplet caught between the drop and the ripple”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“darkening brightness”) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“procedural generation etched into the clay—algorithms of fate weaving new paths from chaos”) slightly bloats a high-pressure beat. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports rhythm. Closure image (“raindrops shattered the suspension”) is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “backward recorded songs…unlocked only by spinning against the grain” conveys lore and method). Figurative language is coherent (“shadows pooled like forgotten echoes”) and payoff-driven. Minor overwriting in “audibly muted pulse of hammers” slightly muddles the deaf POV’s sensory logic, but no loops or scaffold. Final line crystallizes motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “sky bruised purple,” “labored breaths syncing with the fading light.” Sentences vary rhythmically; paragraphs breathe with scene needs. Minor overwriting in “layered tranquility” repeated thrice borders on scaffold, but doesn’t dull closure. No loops or mixed metaphors; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: “crystal shadows danced,” “sweet decay laced with honeyed rain” serve atmosphere and theme. However, figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats (“tidal wave” of memories, “barbs triggered by olfactory keys”), risking slight overwriting. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “as the transformation completes” appears twice with minimal variation—a minor cadence stumble. Final image (“lantern swinging, heart lighter”) lands cleanly, though “bittersweet veil” leans toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“fibers whispering of prison walls he had scaled”) and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“luminous forms pulsing across fractured skies like veins of forgotten lightning”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates during pattern recitation. Minor figurative density in opening beat slightly risks muddle, but clarity holds at closure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Roadsides awaited…”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“hush,” “unbound,” “magnificent simplicity”) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“Shipwrecks hummed faintly, greenhouse glass tinkled like distant bells”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure beat remains sharp. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final note lands with clean, resonant simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language is pattern-taught (amber glow, static hum) and payoff-rich. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“affectionate veil,” “forbidden flower”) borders on purple but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“breeze carrying their cautious laughter onward” borders on purple). Minor scaffold: “cautious exuberance” repeats four times as thematic anchor but verges on label-loop. Sentence variety strong, yet some stacked modifiers (“whimsically attentive eyes scanning the patrons who dotted the lantern-lit paths”) slow momentum. No fatal artifacts, but density dips in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“luminescent ache pulsed,” “laughter echoed rarely, laced with ache”), but rhythm varies purposefully. Minor scaffold appears in repetitive phrasing (“boldly sympathetic” twice in close proximity), and “webs of kinship” verges on thematic echo. Closure beat remains clear despite ornamental density.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“dancers resuming twirls that dissolved into mist”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (cadence as musical motif) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“choral hum: promising release in dominant chords…”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s “uncaged for generations” risks abstraction but is earned by prior concrete work.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“silver needles,” “spectral reflections”) without payoff. Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph lengths create rhythmic breath. Minor redundancy in describing the glass eyes twice slightly dulls momentum. However, information density remains high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot—and the final lines (“nourished shadows,” “equations might yet conjoin”) land with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“callused hands, patient as prayer, peeled back layers…” advances character, setting, and action). Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“sapphire hush,” “wavering cobalt gleams”) borders on purple but pays off tonally at closure. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Figurative coherence holds—magnetic imagery threads throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “verdant fuzz glistening under fading light” conveys setting, mood, and time. Figurative language is coherent (roots uncoiling in veins, words looping like ivy) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“mosaic patterns,” “storm season’s fury mirroring his turmoil”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure lines (“harmony bloomed”) land cleanly. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fat drops splattered the parched ground, tracing silvery trails” merges action, image, and motif. Figurative language is pattern-taught (water as memory, trails as guides) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “haggard grind of survival” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“life flowed anew”) risks abstraction but is anchored by the brooch’s physical gleam. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively—paragraphs breathe with the tides.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language, though occasionally over-embellished (“shadows pooled like ink,” “invisible fingers plucked the strings of reality”). No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences near the climax restate the forces’ intent with minimal added pressure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final line resonates. Deduction for mild overwriting in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“ivory walls veined with salt-crusted shelves”) and varied syntax. However, peak beats suffer slight overwriting: “vision bloomed for all—fragments compiled” uses abstract summary where concrete sensory detail would heighten immediacy. One paraphrase loop: “navigated through the voids they left behind” / “navigated deeper voids.” Final paragraph’s “breathed whole after rain” risks cliché but is salvaged by preceding specificity. No scaffold or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fog made solid—a relic from a spectral line”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “glowing runes, arrows dictating hairpin turns” slightly muddles the crack motif. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one register drift (“starfallen chamber” edges toward purple). Final paragraph’s “perfect loop of analytical art” risks abstraction but is anchored by the return ticket’s concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “entangled memories” and “quantum” metaphors are grounded in the tile’s mechanics, avoiding purple abstraction. Sentence openings vary (“In the stargazer’s…”, “Alone now…”, “By dawn…”), and paragraph cuts align with emotional beats. One minor slip: “haunting songs formed an unheard symphony” slightly repeats the title motif, but it’s functional reprise, not loop. Final lines carry propulsion without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot—but suffers minor overwriting in peak beats. Phrases like “forbidden veins,” “silent revolt,” and “conspiring lovers” risk stacked modifiers, slightly blurring clarity during the mutiny’s climax. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies purposefully. Closure image (“thunder hushed into symphonies”) remains sharp despite figurative density elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff. Figurative language (“deathly vitality,” “ink swirled like living mercury”) serves theme and tension without muddle. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (stacked modifiers) slightly dulls immediacy, but peak beats remain clear. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm breathes with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (“gilded-leaf stationer,” “refracted eras distant and safe”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/refraction motifs) and never muddled in peak beats. Minor overwriting in the opening (“verdant crown forged in miniature defiance”) borders on purple but serves voice. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports rhythm. Closure beat (“dawn's promise, textured with hope”) avoids sentimentality through concrete anchoring in the lamp’s hum.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits exceptional information density: “barnacle scrape” conveys texture, sound, and emotional grit in three words. Rhythm varies purposefully—long, flowing sentences for tidal accumulation; staccato phrases during storm climax (“waves slamming containers like accusations”). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (memory as “translucent skins,” identity as “tide-eroded shore”). Minor overwriting in “velvety, then jagged, coarse as barnacle scrape, silken as fog” slightly dilutes peak-beat clarity, but closure image (“label clutched like a talisman”) remains razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “salt-crusted stones,” “hollow curves humming faintly,” “grim ballet” do triple duty. Figurative language is pattern-taught (resonance, echoes, flight) and pays off in the riddle’s arrow metaphor. Minor overwriting in “wind-whipped clouds painted the sky in perpetual dusk” slightly muddles cause, but no loops or scaffold mar peak beats. Final line crystallizes tone without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose achieves high information density: “swirling vines spelling ‘Roots Hold Fast’ in fractal patterns mimicking raft lashings” conveys method, message, and motif in one image. Sentence openings vary (“Driftwood platforms bobbed…” / “She clutched…” / “Hope flickered…”), and paragraph cuts align with tactical shifts. Minor overwriting in climax (“interlocking gears… cipher… map to buried titles”) risks muddle but pays off via prior pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffold; every line advances pressure, character, or setting.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“shadows that clawed like forgotten dreams”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: three successive metaphors for the grain (“frozen tear,” “temporal defiance,” “borrowed light”) flirt with figurative muddle. Sentence openings vary well, though “He...” begins three key action lines (“He crested,” “He marveled,” “He positioned”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, and information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. The closure image (“grain aglow—one irreplaceable frame”) lands cleanly despite minor earlier excess.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: metaphors (“mist like a lover’s breath,” “prismatic rainbows”) serve atmosphere and diagnostics. Minor overwriting in peak beats—e.g., “magnetic calm settled… drawing all into its serene rhythm”—slightly slows propulsion. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and structure. Closure image (“beacon of heartfelt mastery”) avoids purple prose by tying back to established motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“corrugated walls groaned softly under snow's weight” conveys setting, mood, and decay). Figurative language is coherent (tranquility as “mist,” lake as “canvas of deceptive peace”) and peaks without muddle. Minor redundancy in “subtly confident” repetition (lines 3 and 25), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“crunching under boots… white unknown”) perfectly mirrors departure rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in high-pressure beats: figurative density peaks during climax (“mortar knitting like healed flesh,” “orchestra of taps”), risking muddle. Repetition of “infinitely patient” and “cryptically” creates synonym loops; “wild hush” appears 5 times with diminishing returns. Sentence openings vary well, but cadence becomes incantatory to the point of template rhythm (“He struck… He paced… He moved…”). Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight, yet mid-story has scaffold phrases (“faint vibrations lingered beneath the hush”) that could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though peak beats risk overwriting (“ephemeral strands pulsing with latent power,” “spectral flower”). Sentence openings vary effectively; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor redundancy in “time ran short… time ebbing” and repeated “lonesome splendor” slightly dull momentum. No fatal loops, but figurative density occasionally edges toward purple—still, propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“bodies piled in the cells below” conveys motive, setting, and stakes in six words). Rhythm varies effectively, though occasional over-reliance on figurative language (“shadows detached from walls and began to hover”) risks slight opacity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; however, “repose” recurs four times—functional as tonal anchor but borders on motif fatigue. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully resolves tension without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense with evocative imagery but occasionally overwrites: “lovingly venomous guidance toward his own transcendence” risks abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops (“resonant awakenings” repeated without progression; “winter-cracked fields” as refrain). Figurative coherence holds—ash, venom, light motifs interweave—but “poisoned wine” and “euphoric fire” border on mixed registers. Final paragraph’s cadence stumbles slightly with “debt transcended lifetimes,” weakening propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“tide pools sighed their final beads,” “walls humming with solace like orchids unfurling”), though occasional overwriting risks clarity (“gossamer threads dyed the hue of orchid solace—soft purple solace that soothed the soul’s sharpest thorns” edges into redundancy). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with action. No scaffold loops, but one paraphrase near climax (“mending the canyon’s fractures where precedents had failed” / “thread here bridging a chasm of ruin”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “apple blossoms drifting onto bones that protruded from the earth like forgotten relics” merges image, atmosphere, and theme. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“week of relentless toil… femurs aligned as if frozen in flight”) edges toward figurative saturation, but never muddles causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Final line (“enchanted yet ever cautious”) echoes opening tone without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: most lines advance plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is pattern-taught (holographic vines, quantum mist) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“symphony of soft whirs… coo of synthetic pigeons”) slightly slows propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; final beat (“woven pseudonym, chalk cipher… tapestry of rediscovered truths”) resonates without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion: “echoed silence wrapped the domed chamber like a shroud” leans purple. Minor paraphrase loops (“unheard stories” repeated) and stacked modifiers (“lengthening shadows of fall,” “swirling galaxies”) slightly bloat high-pressure beats. Yet rhythm varies effectively, sentence openings diversify, and information density remains high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“candle burned eternal”) lands cleanly despite minor mid-text excess.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“jagged edge glinting like a captured storm”), varied syntax, and high information density. Minor overwriting in peak beats: three consecutive sentences use “fierce tenderness” or variants, risking paraphrase-loop. Figurative coherence holds—moonlight as healer, mangroves as cathedral—but “unsent letters unfurled in her mind” slightly abstracts. Closure lines avoid scaffold; dawn hinting and shard cooling offer resonant, concrete finality. Read-aloud rhythm flows naturally despite lyric intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“bruised silvers,” “labyrinthine ridges”), but occasional overwriting clouds clarity: “lotus-hearted threnody” and “fractured beauty in their war-torn paradise” verge on purple. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines (“Her motivation burned quietly... weaving hope from frayed threads”) where compression could tighten. However, rhythm varies effectively, sentences advance multiple aims, and the closure beat (“tears grafting new meaning”) avoids artifact, preserving momentum despite slight density in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, though occasional overwriting appears (“muffled the world into whispers,” “laughter rippling through petal-strewn air”). No paraphrase loops, but figurative density in high-pressure beats borders on ornamental without always advancing causality. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with repetitive “pensive mirth” echoes, dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “tendrils of waveform flora undulated” conveys setting, motion, and metaphor in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound as visible texture) and payoff-consistent (fractal reflections). Minor overwriting in “methodically playful” repetition (three uses), but no paraphrase loops. Final line (“murals brighter for the exchange”) resonates without redundancy. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively—long descriptive flows punctuated by staccato realizations (“Certainty fracturing like glass”).

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language (“moth evading lantern light,” “weeds encroached like accusing fingers”), though high-pressure beats occasionally overstack metaphors (“pollen storms and the rattle of nascent gourds”). Sentence openings vary effectively; rhythm accelerates toward climax. One paraphrase loop: “chaos converged” appears twice with minimal variation. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks, but “candidly cryptic” recurs mechanically, slightly dulling its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush yet precise, with high information density (“eyes twin abysses reflecting endless starless nights”). However, figurative overload in climactic beats—“crimson petals of old sorrows, gold stamens of transmuted joy”—edges into mixed metaphor (botanical/astronomical). Template cadence appears in closing triplet fragments (“Peace blossomed. / Reef-shadow joy enveloped all. / Elowen dreamed on.”), though pattern-taught. No loops or scaffolding, but “shyly unstoppable” repetition borders on motif-churn. Still, rhythm propels; read-aloud test passed with minor strain.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (foxglove = regret; light = memory) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“derelict laughter-mirrors, cobwebbed and dim”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but peak beats avoid muddle. Closure line (“winds whispered on... testament to her quest’s quiet triumph”) resonates without redundancy. No loops or scaffold; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“shadows clung to shelves like forgotten syllables”), but peak beats suffer slight overwriting: three adjacent sentences use “cautious exuberance” verbatim, creating paraphrase-loop artifact. Sentence openings vary well, and syntax accelerates during inscription. Closure line (“trust, reborn via interconnected promises”) is strong, though “luminous peace” verges on abstraction. No scaffold or momentum drag elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences multitask (e.g., “light pierced overhead cracks, mottling the steam in resolute patterns” conveys setting, mood, and theme). Figurative language is coherent—volcano “breathes,” chain becomes “veins.” One paraphrase loop (“slyly heartfelt” repeated) and slight overuse of “dappled” risk scaffold, but no clarity loss at closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“feathers blooming soft grays,” “songs trapped in wind”—but avoids overwriting by anchoring metaphors in physical action (mapping, balancing, sending pigeons). Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor flaw: slight repetition in “blooming” (used 5 times), though mostly thematically justified. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Final line (“blooming eternal in the attic’s light”) resonates without sentimentality, closing the motif loop cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies effectively, with strong verbs (“splintered,” “hurled,” “etched”) and specific nouns (“quill barbs,” “shear line”). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“fractured hush sealed them, world refracted anew”) borders on purple but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fractured pressure dome” advances setting and metaphor; “lungs filling with ozone tang” merges atmosphere and embodiment. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light motifs: prisms, pulses, fireflies) and pays off in closure. However, slight overwriting in “shadowseam wonder” (repeated twice) and “ceaseless dark” verges on redundancy. Sentence variety sustains momentum—no template cadence—but “softly ingenious” appears three times, risking label fatigue. Still, zero loops or causality-obscuring artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/fireworks → rainbows; seeds → paths) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“weaving guesses from fragments like a weaver mending fog”) edges toward purple, but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety supports momentum; no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “joyful surrender” risks slight abstraction but is anchored by the physical seed in her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, opening lines establish voice (“pulsed with the wild rhythm”), and metaphors cohere (“boardwalk groaning like a beast awakening”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“orchestrate serendipity, crafting the illusion of pure chance from deliberate design”) slightly dilutes immediacy, but figurative language remains purposeful. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“bishop bridged them”) crystallizes theme without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “roots of silver light burrowed from her soles” advances plot, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (tides, gaps, anchoring) and taught early. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“fledging—diaphanous wings of tidal mist unfurled”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“tides turn, but some verses endure”) resonates without redundancy. Deduction for near-purple flourish during fledge, though still controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled; sentences vary in length and structure, advancing atmosphere and insight simultaneously. Figurative density is high yet coherent—metaphors (fog as “lover’s breath,” ripples as “fractal dances”) align with the glazier’s worldview. Minor overwriting in “noctilucent reckonings” and “clear complexity” risks abstraction, but closure image (“ordinary light, refracted true”) grounds it. No loops or scaffold; every line serves theme or character.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but overwriting flares in high-pressure beats: “night’s hard softness,” “slow dance of celestial bodies,” “fragile memories” stack metaphors without pattern payoff. The phrase “gently skilled” repeats as label rather than action, triggering mild scaffold. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final paragraph’s “binding scars to stars” risks purple closure, dulling the otherwise earned poise by 0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (e.g., “hollows aching for renewal,” “serene upheaval”) and avoids purple excess. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“colossal and iridescent,” “cascading waves”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with the rhythm of trials, and the final line (“she had flown the trials true”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “pages curled like dying leaves” advances atmosphere and character simultaneously. Sentence openings vary (“Pushing through…”, “Kneeling…”, “Heart pounding…”), and paragraph cuts serve momentum. One minor slip: “sensitively perceptive” repeats verbatim (lines 3 and 12), creating a faint paraphrase loop—but it doesn’t obscure closure. Otherwise, zero scaffold; every line propels story, character, or theme with lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting blurs clarity: “dusky harmony” appears four times as label rather than evolving sensation, and phrases like “transcendent grace” verge on abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats (“borrowed rhythm synced with her essence”) without always advancing causality. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports scene needs—yet two adjacent lines restate heartbeat infusion (“flutter here… steady thump there”), triggering minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “weathered marble veined with moss at midsummer's zenith” stacks modifiers without advancing pressure. Minor scaffold appears in “flawed beauty” repetition (opening/closing), though it serves thematic echo. Figurative coherence holds, but “shadows that danced like flawed beauties” introduces a strained simile. Final paragraph avoids purple excess, grounding emotion in concrete loss (“quiet ache of what was forever lost”).

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“drought's signature scrawling coordinates,” “geologic time” echoes feel slightly redundant). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and paragraph cuts heighten momentum. Minor scaffold in mid-story (“Philanthropy was his mask...”) briefly stalls, but closure lines (“Life, perhaps, would answer”) earn their weight. No fatal loops, but two adjacent lines rephrase “fractured” beauty near climax (-0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid but over-ornamented: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (“arms arcing like sonnets,” “fingers delicate as frost-laced vines”), creating density without pattern payoff. Mixed metaphor logic—threads “uncoil like suppressed screams” then become “ash”—muddles mechanics. No paraphrase loops, but “bodily poetic” repeats as label rather than evolving action. Final third avoids scaffold, yet purple prose slightly obscures the loom’s causal role.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is rich but occasionally over-embellished: “meteor hush” repeats six times, bordering on motif fatigue; phrases like “half-lit epiphanies” verge on label-speak despite contextual grounding. Yet rhythm varies skillfully—long, looping sentences for reflection give way to terse declarations at climax. High information density: “reversed the stick fully” conveys physical, thematic, and moral reversal in one gesture. Minor redundancy in “serene” descriptors slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“orange sails against the void,” “pollen dusting knots like golden script”) and high information density. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“verdant vigil complete,” “purple promises”) but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative coherence remains strong despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “snowmelt ardor,” “technically gentle radiance,” “punched voids that could sing” all serve theme and character. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts breathe with ritual pacing. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“holographic voices chanting forgotten names in layered harmony”) edges toward purple but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image remains sharp despite lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity (“vines clawing at her boots like forgotten promises” followed by “storm approached with ethereal grit”). Minor scaffold: “foresight hindsight only” repeats as label. Final third avoids artifacts, though “precisely playful” borders on motif churn. Information density is high, but some sentences prioritize texture over propulsion (“decaying directive interfaced, its voice a glitchy purr”).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bioluminescent vines that pulsed in dusky harmony” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“dusky” recurs to modulate mood) and payoff-earned (vines glow brighter in sympathy). Minor artifact: “empirically ironic” repeats as near-label, slightly dulling peak beats—but clarity at closure remains intact. Sentence variety supports rhythm; paragraph cuts heighten cadence without scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “faint vibrations stirred… probes into cellular memory” merges action, setting, and method. Sentence openings vary (“Elias approached,” “Thorne scowled,” “Reality shifted”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “cellular memory surged: the warmth of unscarred skin…” risks abstraction, but “unscarred skin” grounds it. No loops or scaffold; every line advances pressure, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“boots sinking into muddy earth that kept him firmly grounded”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (glass mountains refracting fog) and pays off in closure. No loops or scaffold; variations in sentence length create rhythm matching breath cycles. One minor density slip: “fragile hope he could not abandon” edges toward abstraction, but it’s anchored by immediate tactile context. Final line (“orchard felt whole”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “twisted apple trees heavy with crimson fruit that dripped sweet sap onto cracked marble pews” does triple duty. Minimal scaffolding; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. One slight overwriting in “visions cascading: not grand prophecies, but intimate truths”—borderline telling—but redeemed by immediate dramatization. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Strong verbs (“bloomed,” “crunched,” “unfurling”) and concrete nouns (“pistachio shell cameo,” “porcelain sinks”) avoid purple prose. However, recurring phrase “brightened disquiet” appears four times—functional as motif but verges on scaffold. No paraphrase loops, but “simply complicated” repeats thrice without deepening. Final paragraph’s cadence (“forever blooming”) resolves cleanly, though minor redundancy in “bewildered no more” after prior clarity slightly dulls closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere (e.g., “chronometer still ticking erratically” implies temporal instability). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“unheard symphony” → “triumphant silence”) and payoff-integrated. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“labyrinthine bookstore burrowed… like roots”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure causality. Final beat’s “pages now alive with promise” risks abstraction but is grounded by prior botanical specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears (“blissfully aberrant fusion of lion's mane, goat's curl, and serpent's coil” slightly strains). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere within established logic. Closure beat is clear, though “unkindled solace” recurs more as motif than evolving insight, slightly dulling final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “precise chaos,” “blood returning to stone,” “threads rumored to be spun from starlight” verge on purple. More critically, the ending suffers scaffold loops—“Wait, precision... No, adherence strict... Wait, recount needed?”—which read as meta-commentary artifacts, dulling closure. These self-referential intrusions break immersion and trigger a −0.8 artifact penalty. Otherwise, rhythm and imagery are strong, but the final third’s artificial word-count anxiety undermines line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with narrative need. Minor overwriting appears in mid-section (“veins of forgotten rivers, telling tales of pressure and release”) where metaphor slightly outpaces propulsion. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts in closure beat; final lines land with clean resonance. Figurative coherence remains intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “facets shattered like a fallen star’s heart” does triple duty (image, emotion, motif). Minor overwriting in climax (“light surged—rekindled, pure and defiant”) slightly muddles focus, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary (“In the hush…”, “One dust-choked dawn…”, “Nights blurred…”); paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Figurative coherence holds—thistle, hum, shard motifs interweave without contradiction. Closure image (“Hope, like thistles on the breeze, endured”) lands cleanly, recharging opening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“lightning etched jagged veins,” “frost on glass”) is coherent and recurring without muddle. Minor scaffold in “preemptively nostalgic” repetitions (three times), but justified as a defining trait. Final paragraph’s rhythm (“hush deepened to peace… Summer-Quill Archivist endured”) delivers earned cadence without loops or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose balances poetic density with propulsion—e.g., “vines heavy with luminous flowers cascaded over ancient stone walls” grounds lyricism in physical weight. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“abstract swirls that mocked his weary eyes”) slightly dulls immediacy, but fire-spinning sequences crackle with kinetic clarity. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“He circled…”, “Up close…”, “With serious playfulness…”). Closure beat (“laughter bubbled from Elias’s chants”) avoids sentimentality through concrete sound.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language (“voice cracking like shells underfoot,” “time’s viscous hesitation”), but avoids overwriting through rhythmic control and concrete anchors. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor deduction for slightly elevated diction in peak beats (“resilient nacre,” “textured impressions”) that borders on register drift, though it aligns with Elaron’s chronicler persona.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density—nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot—but occasionally overloads figurative language in peak beats (e.g., “intangibly tangible” paired with “weight she could almost grip” borders on mixed metaphor). No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; rhythm varies effectively with paragraph length and sentence structure. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “core concept of luxurious quiet,” slightly academic for Elara’s lexicon, but clarity remains intact. Closure image (“Silence sprouted eternal”) resonates without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language is pattern-taught (prisms, crystals, storms) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“vaulting hush,” “whispers of color”) slightly slows momentum but establishes necessary texture. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final lines land cleanly. Sentence variety supports propulsion—no syntactic monotony despite lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose shows high information density: “paint to bubble and slough away like molting skin” conveys action, metaphor, and transformation in one image. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (short during drone chase). Minor overwriting in peak beat: “replaying Neo-Eden’s lost paradise” slightly abstract after concrete ascent. No loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent (flake as heartbeat, paint as skin). Closure image remains sharp despite slight abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“scars mirroring his own—jagged lines from their shared tempests”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (ash, scars, breath) and payoff-integrated. Minor scaffold in “memories stirred: her grasp like ironweed…” slightly flattens momentum, but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm crystallizes closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shadows woven from forgotten dreams draped the... farm like a living veil” establishes texture without overwriting. Sentences vary rhythmically—long lyrical strands for atmosphere, staccato fragments for glitches. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances plot, character, or setting. One near-miss: “virtuously mischievous” repeats four times, but each instance deepens meaning (trait → action → identity → legacy), avoiding redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and often multi-functional (“golden shadows deepened as evening yawned wider” merges time, tone, and mood). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity: “standing waves converged on a bookshelf... outlining a concealed panel” strains physical plausibility. Repetition of “eloquently silent” and “mused” borders on scaffold-loop. Final paragraph avoids purple excess, but mid-story metaphors risk muddle over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“dew-slick leaves,” “puppeteer’s hook”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (threads, puppets, fruit) and payoff-rich. Minor overwriting in “factually mystical” repetitions slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops or scaffold dull the closure. Final chime-and-thread cascade achieves propulsion without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “weary sentinels” for shelves, “ghostly fingerprints” for dust, “tactfully hopeful” as a refrain—all advance character or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary (“Eleanor pushed…”, “It was 1872…”, “One box…”, “Intrigued…”), and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Minor overwriting in “fragile paper trails of countless orphaned children” slightly blurs specificity, and “magnify small kindnesses” borders on abstraction but is redeemed by concrete follow-through. No loops or scaffold; every line propels.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “sun bled orange into gutters” conveys time, mood, setting). Figurative language is pattern-taught: water/light motifs recur without muddle. Minor overwriting in climax (“stars dancing in approval”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. No loops or scaffold—every image advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “vested hush” and “quietly vivid” recur with near-synonym variation (“palpable weight descending,” “reverent quiet”), risking scaffold. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without always advancing causality—e.g., “dewdrops swelling... like unshed tears” adds mood but no tactical shift. However, rhythm varies effectively, and closure lines (“whispers of what he had stilled”) land with earned resonance. Minor artifact drag prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“colossal branches twisted like ancient fingers,” “mossy delight bubbling”), but occasional overwriting dulls peak beats: “transformed always, as the folklore promised—a principle etched in every arbor myth” stacks exposition onto action. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“decode the message... unraveling prophecies”; “monuments... shrines”), and “mossy delight” repeats six times, risking motif fatigue. Yet rhythm varies effectively, and the final line (“sorter’s world transformed always”) resonates without redundancy. No scaffold sentences or simultaneity errors mar clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “mist hung like forgotten thoughts,” “vines with clock springs for grip.” Figurative language is consistent (water/time/uncertainty motifs) and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “he dismissed them as flukes, polishing… resetting…” slightly paraphrases, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure. Sentence variety supports propulsion, especially in the fissure traversal.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Rain sluiced... polishing rusted crucibles into mirrors of luminous regret” establishes setting, mood, and theme). Figurative language is consistent—alchemical/metallic metaphors never contradict. Minor overwriting in “factually mystical” (slight register drift), but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs. Closure line (“name-weights understood at last”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, setting, or conflict. Figurative language is cohesive (light/tears/frost motifs) without muddle. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“spectral fingers,” “warped chord erupted”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve rhythm; no loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting risks muddle (“agony into a compass for memory,” “bones leveraging against gravity like variables”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but three adjacent sentences use “brace” as verb/noun, creating minor cadence drag. Final paragraph achieves lyrical propulsion without sacrificing clarity. One near-mixed metaphor (“strap looped around her wrist like a crude abacus”) slightly strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information yield per line (“vaporous lanterns swayed on silken cords and the wind whispered secrets across bubbling retorts”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “ethereal shimmer, as if deciding whether to exist” edges into abstraction, and “spectral shores” risks vagueness. No loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“lightning forked like veins” then “foam’s curl” as rune) slightly blurs coherence without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“fine motes aligned in clockwork spirals” reveals both clue and theme). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (ghosts as “smoke,” burden as “weightless”). Sentence openings vary (“He slipped inside…”, “Overhead fluorescents…”, “Theo, skillfully observant…”). Closure beat (“pocketed the barrel—a talisman against future façades”) ties object to theme without overwriting. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“Glass fruits chimed softly as he brushed past, their pages aglow with half-forgotten truths”). Figurative language is coherent—whispers “rustle like a gale through dry leaves”—and avoids purple excess. Minor overwriting in the final cascade (“Rupture inevitable…”) borders on incantatory but serves thematic echo without muddling closure. Zero loops or scaffold; information density is high (“bottled forever, whispered approval through the winds”).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (time as rivers, sorrow as gilding) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“gilded spires twisted like frozen screams against the void”) risks purple prose, but momentum recovers. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Final line’s cadence crystallizes theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“brass frame etched with the covenant of rust—a sacred pact forged by ancient alchemists”) and strong verbs (“midnight recoiled”). However, figurative density occasionally borders on overload: “tinkersong wonder filled the air, a melody of gears whispering secrets” risks mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold in “His method crystallized in a flash of insight”—slightly tells rather than shows. Still, momentum never stalls; rhythm serves pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush yet precise, with high information density: “limestone walls wept mineral tears” conveys setting, mood, and character bias in one image. However, repetitive phrasing (“resonant hush” appears 7 times) edges into scaffold-loop territory, dulling its impact by the final paragraph. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “frozen waves” for stalactites slightly conflicts with later “weeping” stone. Sentence variety supports momentum, but the closing lines suffer minor overwriting (“Word count pulsed like the compass”).

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with strong verbs (“thrums,” “ignites,” “scaffolded”) and varied syntax. Information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (e.g., “winds howled like forgotten turbines,” “shadows bloomed,” “sea’s tumble”), creating mild overwriting. No paraphrase loops, but the phrase “perpetually learning” repeats verbatim three times, functioning as scaffold rather than organic refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: metaphors (“amber pavilion… like a lover’s whispered secret”) serve theme, not ornament. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror seasonal shifts. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“vivid testaments to petals that shunned the sun”), risking density overload, but never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold—each image advances character or atmosphere. Final lines resonate without redundancy, though “umbral tenderness” recurs just enough to feel intentional, not repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Opening line establishes voice and stakes instantly; final line echoes “dunes whispering justice” with earned resonance. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“shadows stirred… eyes like embers in tension with the intruding past”) slightly dilutes immediacy, but figurative language remains coherent. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though one run of participle openings (“Gathered… spelled… formed”) risks simultaneity error—offset by clear sequential logic.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; figurative language serves theme (lanterns as “forgotten prayers,” memory as “volatile elixir”). Minor overwriting in mid-section: “juggling essences drawn through the bottle's empathic bond” edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“conceived families linking arms… elders teaching youth”) slightly dilutes momentum. Final paragraph’s cadence redeems with resonant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“velvet disquiet,” “dissolving oaths”) and pays off in the climax. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“regret's velvet drag, hope's fleeting spark, fear's insidious coil”) borders on stacked modifiers but remains coherent. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies purposefully to mirror immersion’s rising intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “viscous as honeyed fog, threaded with the pulse of unlived springs” does triple duty—sensory, thematic, character-revealing. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“After…”, “A tiny…”, “Elara had…”). Figurative language is coherent—vortex as “calm rage,” time as “gritty silk”—with no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors stabilization: longer clauses, resolved cadence. Minor overwriting in “frozen coliseum” slightly dilutes momentum but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere (“Gusts tugged his woolen cloak, carrying scents of ice and ozone”). Rhythm varies effectively—paragraph lengths shift with tension. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“stars piercing the velvet dark like frozen notes”) borders on purple but serves tone. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; filter verbs are sparse. One slight redundancy: “solstice hush” recurs without deepening until final reprise, but not enough to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “vein of liquid sunlight,” “atmospheric sigh,” “cosmic wind that cradled its descent” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphor in action. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., single-line “Hours blurred…”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “radiant filigree,” “primal elegance” approach stock lyricism. No loops or scaffold, but “flourishing stillness” risks abstraction—saved by immediate embodiment in starlight “blooming brightest in vulnerability's hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Ethereal figures shimmered... yet held purpose”) and strong verbs (“swallowed,” “quivered,” “wove”). Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “translucent beekeepers in veiled hats and smoke-stained aprons” borders on stacked modifiers, and “prismatic honeycombs on the sand” risks slight abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the climax restate the box’s humming (“alive with trapped light” / “hummed faintly”), triggering a −0.2 paraphrase penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “clocks spiraled into infinities” conveys world-altering chaos in five words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (time as texture: “grit,” “weave,” “abrasion”) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “silken drags of dawns, gritty rasps of midnights”—slightly purple but earned by context. Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush yet purposeful, with high information density—e.g., “poems fluttering like captured breaths” conveys motion, fragility, and theme in one image. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with action, and figurative language coheres (flight/stillness, weaving/discord). However, three adjacent sentences near the climax stack modifiers (“warmly attentive care,” “fragile contraption,” “woven dawns motif”), creating slight density drag. No loops or scaffold, but the phrase “warmly attentive” recurs as label rather than action twice, nudging toward redundancy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sunlight sparking faint blue arcs” does triple duty (image, action, stakes). Figurative language is pattern-taught (stone “petrified giants,” copper “conduits”) and pays off in the humming lattice. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“Visions flooded… ghostly scenes”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“bronze quiet,” “luminous skepticism”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “rainwashed stones gleaming like bronze under quiet duress”—“duress” slightly anthropomorphizes stone. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution. Deduction only for one borderline mixed metaphor (“chemical harmony” after “twitched in simulated life”).

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“narrow vastness,” “blooming jetty”) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“luminescent flowers clung improbably”) risks slight register drift, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical texture—petals carry promise, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative but occasionally over-ornamented: “wind-whispers through jagged seams mimicked lost heartbeats” and “rad-scorched suns” risk purple prose. “Wild hush” appears 11 times—effective as refrain but borders on scaffold repetition. Strong verbs (“gnawed,” “threading,” “alchemized”) outweigh weak modifiers, yet phrases like “moth-eaten memories” flirt with cliché. Final paragraph’s cadence redeems momentum with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (“seconds outside bled into hours within,” “stars trailing like comet tails”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with emotional beats, and figurative language serves theme (silence “echoed,” then “harmonious”). However, late passages verge on overwriting: “Gilded rose spun true. Blessed paths ahead. Stars witnessed all.” These near-aphoristic lines risk abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but minor compression in final paragraph slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “bruised purple” sky, “frozen fang” spire, “void-secrets” in queen—all advance atmosphere and stakes. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, though occasional stacked modifiers (“bioluminescent veins pulsed in the walls, illuminating the grand chamber…”) flirt with overwriting. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line propels. Minor deduction for one slightly strained metaphor (“icy tendrils snapping like brittle veins”)—but clarity never suffers, especially at closure where “sky righted, heart unbound” lands with clean power.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “poisoned winds from the sabotaged spires felled the king” conveys cause, effect, and scale). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“luminous gale of absence”) slightly muddles causality, but rhythm varies purposefully. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (shadow as smoke, light as absent stars). Final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “petrified roots,” “thunder forever contained in her chest,” “silken rasp” all advance atmosphere and character. Minor overwriting in “verdant valleys—her home's shadow” slightly blurs specificity, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Closure line (“mercury-glass eyes forever changed”) recharges motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: metaphors cohere (chess/labyrinth/tapestry as interlocking systems), sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts heighten rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“fierce repose, a calm ferocity born of years wandering frozen edges of regret”) slightly dilutes immediacy—elevated diction borders on ornamental. No loops, scaffold, or causality-obscuring artifacts. Final line (“corridors no longer labyrinthine”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“towers of bone rose like forgotten spines”), though occasional overwriting appears (“forged hush cloaked every whisper” borders on mixed metaphor). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve momentum (e.g., transition from alcove to chamber). Minor scaffold in “innocently mischievous” repetition (three times), but no fatal loops. Final lines avoid summary, resolving through resonant image (“pale spire bending light eternal”).

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies effectively—long, flowing descriptions fracture into staccato phrases during drowning. Minor overwriting occurs: “kintsugi intentions surged” borders on label-speak, and “quilting” as verb recurs near-synonymously. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“Memories quilted anew… Quilts of village matrons…”) flirt with paraphrase. Closure remains unblurred, propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“mirror-like calm,” “dying stars”) and pays off in the lagoon’s reflective surface. Minor overwriting appears in “jagged shards of the mirror scattered across his weathered studio floor”—“jagged” and “scattered” slightly redundant—but doesn’t dull closure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “screaming tenderness” and “crystalline vibrations” border on abstract label-speak, though they’re redeemed by concrete context. Minor paraphrase loops (“whispers traveled farther than shouts” echoed verbatim). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports emotional cadence. No scaffold or simultaneity errors, but two adjacent sentences restate the cork’s power, triggering a −0.2 loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “patchwork navigator,” “verdigris-crusted relic,” “eel sinew at quarter” do triple duty (character, setting, theme). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor artifact: “raw solace” appears twice—first as concept, then as closure—but the repetition is purposeful, not looped. No overwriting in peak beats; metaphors (“stars wheeled unchecked,” “concrete hives”) are coherent and grounded. Final line (“piecing worlds from loss’s threads”) recharges the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “gnarled trees clung like defiant prayers” merges setting, theme, and character in one stroke. Figurative language is pattern-taught (storms = internal tempests; truffles = hidden grace) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “milky opalescence veined with gold” slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line—“whole in his duality”—resonates without explaining, trusting the reader to feel the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“softly persistent” recurs meaningfully) and avoids muddle.

Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly modulates closure without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“petrichor and the hum of hidden life”; “dew-kissed petals under his lantern’s glow”). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors—and peaks coherently in the cavern sequence. Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“blooming vibrantly only when rains swelled subterranean streams… Legends tied it to ancient navigators”) edges toward redundancy but doesn’t dull closure. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting risks clarity (“scientifically romantic pulse blending empirical heat equations with the poetry of eternal flames”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but three adjacent sentences use “density” variants (lines 12–14), triggering minor redundancy. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Closure beat avoids artifacts—final lines (“presence endured”) resonate cleanly—but mid-story figurative stacking slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“quill fashioned from raven’s feather poised above bark’s virgin veins”). Figurative language is coherent (grave “weeds choking headstone,” thermals twisting body into “arrow of light”). Minor overwriting in flight sequence (“stratospheres of memory”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s concision (“Feral nostalgia quieted…”) earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “water residue gleamed like unshed tears” does triple duty (image, emotion, motif). Sentence openings vary (“Within the hush…”, “Once an aromatherapist…”, “Deeper in the escapement…”), avoiding template cadence. Minor overwriting in “frantic scratches on a delivery room door”—a slight mixed metaphor—but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s tightening (“But wait… No, refocus…”) risks self-consciousness but ultimately serves Charged Poise by mirroring Elara’s discipline.

No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though some adjacent lines restate concepts (“illusion of distance,” “feigned multiplicity”). Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports theme. Closure image is clear, but a few mixed metaphors (“scalpel” for lexicon) slightly blur sense without harming causality.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “horizon logs screamed midnight discrepancies”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“razor edges” applied to key, time, belief) and payoff-coherent.

No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “caps of Agaricus luminara pulsing soft blues and greens” establishes species, color, motion, and mood in one clause. Sentence rhythms vary purposefully—longer during contemplation, fragmented during realization (“Permeable barriers,” she whispered).

    Prose is dense with purpose: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot (“mossy hummocks that sighed forgotten ballads into his skin”). Figurative language is coherent (ultrasonics as threads, notes as fireflies) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“joy’s trill, sorrow’s bass”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure beat (“tears traced his cheeks, evaporating into the blaze”) remains sharp. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“stones drifted upward like forgotten sighs”) and varied syntax, though one minor redundancy appears: “confidently uncertain” recurs without deepening. Figurative language is coherent (gravity as regret’s curve, pen as comet), and momentum never stalls. Final paragraph’s cadence recharges motifs without scaffold. No loops or register drift; slight deduction for one repeated phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the harbor’s pulse. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “melodies evaporated like morning mist,” “camera... relic from a bygone era of captured souls,” and “mapping silence” border on stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops, but “joyful sorrow” repeats as a near-label. Closure image remains clear despite slight overwriting in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“volcanic tenderness” recurs meaningfully) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“tenderness exploding like lava kissing the sea”) edges toward purple but earns its place through emotional payoff. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Closure beat remains clear despite lyrical intensity, though one mixed metaphor (“threads of fate binding past”) slightly dilutes precision.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“petals spiraling upward in a vortex of light and lament”). Figurative language is pattern-taught: sound births light, sorrow colors auroras. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“auroral veils of regret draping the garden”) slightly blurs cause/effect, but closure remains sharp. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. No loops or scaffold—every image advances conflict or character.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “auroras smeared the sky purple” merges setting/atmosphere/motive in one phrase. Sentence openings vary (“Lightning flickered…”, “As the labyrinth’s maintenance worker…”, “Harlan emerged…”), and rhythm accelerates during the race. Minor overwriting in “storm-induced static” and “gravitational shift” edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“puddles mirrored the night sky, fractured glimpses of celestial fire amid the stillwater tension”), yet momentum never stalls. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., post-weave stillness). Minor overwriting in peak beats—“spiralingly calm” appears thrice, slightly diluting impact—but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative coherence holds: water/light/shadow metaphors interlock without contradiction, though “dental mirror” risks tonal dissonance (mitigated by its healer backstory).

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-functional lines (“stars pricked the velvet sky” establishes setting, mood, and cosmic scale). Figurative language is coherent—magnetism and chess motifs unify imagery. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“veils of fog that clung like forgotten regrets”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic closure, though one mixed metaphor (“forests destined to overshadow dogma”) nudges clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fists trembling and blades undrawn” compresses the Cataclysm’s effect economically. Sentence variety supports momentum, though occasional overwriting (“bioluminescent waves lapped the pilings”) edges toward purple. No loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final image (“unbound at last”) avoids summary, resolving through action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information yield per line—shavings “curl like pale whispers,” petals crumble “like memories under pressure.” Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“sculpt the blade of fate, mirroring the titans above…”), risking figurative saturation, but pattern is consistent and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure image (“Darkness fell, hush remade once more”) resolves with rhythmic finality, though one or two metaphors lean toward ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting risks clarity: “quartz turning liquid at the edges, air thickening into mist” borders on simultaneous impossibility, and “tremor of certainty quivered… like the first crack in eternal ice” mixes tactile and auditory metaphors. Still, information density is high—most lines multitask—and rhythm varies effectively. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; final paragraph’s “pregnant with possibilities” slightly verges on abstraction but is anchored by prior concrete imagery. Minor figurative muddle prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—“molten heart of the central furnace” conveys setting, heat, and myth in five words. Rhythm varies purposefully: long sentences for atmosphere, short staccato phrases for climax (“Feathers flared; it accepted”). Minor overwriting in “innocently cunning spark in his eye” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure causality. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes opening, closing the textural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“prismatic fury,” “gossamer yet unbreakable”) slightly muddles clarity but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally.

Figurative language is purposeful—“mosaic of liquid jewels,” “topographic map of madness”—without muddle or purple excess. Minor redundancy in “steadily curious” repetition (three times) slightly dulls propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts mar peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with imagery but avoids purple overload; most metaphors cohere (e.g., dust motes as “fleeting regrets,” pagoda as “frozen scream of light”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “anguished joy” appears three times, verging on repetitive emphasis. Sentence openings vary effectively, though two adjacent lines near climax paraphrase (“shimmering motes that coalesced into visions… children laughing…” followed by “spectral visions of innocence’s dawn”). Closure beat remains clear despite slight figurative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “dew-kissed fog curling around benches” advances atmosphere and character simultaneously. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“quietly vivid” recurs meaningfully) without muddle. Minor scaffold appears in “shedding layers” explanations (three adjacent lines risk filter-verb stacking), slightly dulling immediacy. Yet propulsion remains strong—sentences vary in length/openings, and the final paragraph’s cadence (“Tomorrow... But tonight...”) crystallizes closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most lines multitask (e.g., “meteor hush” conveys atmosphere, time, and emotional tone). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“displaced miracle’s odd grace”) slightly muddles clarity but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is pattern-taught (scars → coffee rings → roots) and pays off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“silver vein,” “plasma surge”) but occasionally overwrites—three consecutive sentences use “unwritten calendar” with diminishing returns. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Figurative coherence holds: stardust motif threads without contradiction. Minor scaffold in “time warped… solstices unmarked” slightly dulls momentum, but closure beat (“ideas erupting like novas”) remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (lullaby shards, wave functions coiling like smoke) with no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “fractured lullaby” repetitions, but pattern serves thematic resonance. Final paragraph’s “Hush.” delivers perfect closure beat—concise, charged, echoing opening. No loops or register drift; voice remains calibrated to the guard’s evolving perception.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“rustflowers in the undergear,” “bioluminescent oil”), but occasional overwriting risks clarity: “probable miracles bloomed like rustflowers” borders on mixed metaphor. Sentence variety supports momentum, though a few high-pressure beats stack modifiers (“colossal, half-buried engine pulsing with bioluminescent oil”). No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final image (“humming eternally with insight”) cleanly resolves the opening’s hum motif.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or motif. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though occasional stacked metaphors (“brambles parting like reluctant curtains”) flirt with overwriting. No paraphrase loops, but “gently persistent” repeats verbatim three times, creating minor scaffold. Final paragraph’s “dance with waves’ lullaby” elegantly echoes opening.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“frozen veins,” “choir-like flourishes”) and pays off in closure.

Minor overwriting in “periodically eternal” repetition (three uses), but pattern pays off in closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s “horizons reborn” risks slight abstraction but is earned by prior concrete work.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally tipping into overwriting (“thunderous serenity” appears four times, diluting impact). Minor paraphrase loops exist: “awkwardly confident” repeats without deepening; “rebellion’s lull” echoes redundantly. However, rhythm varies skillfully, and key lines (“Meaning pierced the mess”) land with precision. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; closure image remains sharp despite textual richness.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ash-streaked hair,” “geysers roared like insurgent war cries,” “bioluminescent code” do triple duty. Sentence openings vary (“She had led…” / “Startled, she knelt…” / “That night…”), avoiding template cadence. Minor overwriting in climax (“fluids mingled… uncoiled… veins shimmering”) borders on figurative density but pays off in the sapling’s reveal. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “white dress shredded in the rubble” conveys backstory, trauma, and irony in six words. Figurative language is purposeful (“fragile Eden,” “joy to ash”) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “somatic markers” phrasing borders therapy-speak but is immediately grounded in bodily sensation (“gut to spine”). Final paragraph’s “grounded light” risks abstraction but is anchored by fireflies and waves.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “luminescent ache settled in his chest, glowing faintly like phosphorescent waves”—where simile and metaphor overlap. No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences use “rhetorical question” phrasing, creating minor redundancy. Final paragraph’s momentum dips slightly with summary-like closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“porcelain skin and crimson eyes gleaming unnaturally” establishes vulnerability and otherness in one stroke). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“prismatic shards—time warped instantly”) slightly muddles causality but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm modulates masterfully from languid post-eclipse hush to urgent vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong verbs (“entombed,” “shatter,” “threading”) and varied sentence openings. However, repetitive phrasing (“bravely conflicted” appears three times), near-synonym loops (“dizzying quiet” / “electric hush” / “secret pulse”), and stacked modifiers (“ice-veined display,” “storm-lashed spires”) create mild scaffold drag. No fatal artifacts, but these micro-loops slightly dull propulsion in the climax, preventing 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “petals unfurling like flames held in check”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“serene inferno,” “tranquil blaze” repeated) borders on stacked modifiers. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“woven harmony” echoing earlier “weave”). Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “vibrating petals unfurled like translucent scrolls transliterating emotions” does setting, character, and concept work. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“dissonant fury,” “transliterated terror”) edges toward purple, but peak beats stay clear. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Figurative logic holds—sound as garden, silence as lure—though “zigzagging wildly” slightly repeats motif without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“Stars wheeled overhead... mocking her own circling regrets”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (celestial metaphors) and payoff-consistent (comets → orbits → stars rewritten). Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“dripped accusations,” “inescapable comets”) slightly dilutes immediacy, but peak beats avoid muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“Guilt gnawed… an old dissonance from a cradle’s edge” merges emotion, sound, and backstory). Figurative language is coherent—frost, meteor hush, amber sunlight—all reinforcing the sonic/celestial motif without muddle. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“dissonance swelled—his guilt's orchestra”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but rhythm varies effectively (e.g., short clauses during temporal collapse). Zero paraphrase loops; final line (“hush of meteors falling unseen”) recharges the opening with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but generally precise, with high information density: “spirals of azure and amethyst sand evoking forgotten dreams” conveys color, motion, and theme in one stroke. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with rhythm, and figurative language serves pressure. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“voices overlapping in a cacophony of unburdened confessions”), and “lilac unease” recurs with slight redundancy. No loops or scaffold, though two adjacent lines near climax verge on paraphrase (“fracture to fragile unity” / “social fractures aligning”).

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“crimson fissures wept cold light like frozen blood”), but occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats: “arms of steel, unyielding against the barbarism” edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “warm coldness” repeats without deepening. Final paragraph’s rhythm falters slightly with stacked clauses. Still, high information density and strong verbs carry momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“colors exploded into sounds, nostalgic fanfares... crashing like waves”), but occasional overwriting occurs: “orchestral rainbows” and “velvet applause” risk mixed metaphor. Sentence openings vary effectively; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. No paraphrase loops, though “echoes” repeat functionally. Minor register drift in “spectral pact” feels slightly external, but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “static shock... stripping away comforting illusions” advances plot, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (light/willow/fractal motifs) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “somatic marker” repetition, but not looped. Sentence variety supports rhythm—long descriptive strands for setup, clipped urgency during tests. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors earned stasis without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “waves gnawed at stone walls,” “veins etched like lightning” avoid cliché through precise verbs and unexpected similes. Sentence variety supports rhythm—fragments during crisis (“Glowing orbs... drifted upward”), flowing clauses in reflection. One paraphrase loop: “transitional object” appears three times in close proximity with minimal variation. Figurative coherence holds; thermal metaphors unify emotion and environment. Final paragraph’s cadence (“maps where emotions float free...”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly disciplined—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. However, figurative density occasionally borders on overwriting (“amber dreams stirred anew, possibilities cataloged eternally”), and minor redundancy appears (“quietly inspired” repeats three times). No fatal loops or scaffold, but the final paragraph’s cadence leans slightly ornamental. Still, momentum holds, and the read-aloud rhythm varies effectively between breathless urgency and meditative pause.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and strong verbs (“edged,” “clutched,” “igniting”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“silver hush” recurs meaningfully) and avoids muddle. However, slight overwriting occurs: “prudently daring” repeats three times, verging on scaffold; “feathered in silver hush” risks purple adjacent to “ethereally glinting.” No fatal loops, but minor synonym churn (“fracture,” “fissure,” “crevice”) dilutes momentum just below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but occasionally overwrought: “spindrift serenity soothing the storm within” borders on mixed metaphor. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“distill complexity into essence” echoed as “distilled promise”). Figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without full pattern payoff, risking density overload. Yet rhythm propels—sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with mood—and closure image (“fog-bound no more”) lands cleanly despite slight ornamental drag earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching twilight’s descent.

No loops or scaffold—each image builds toward the pot’s creation, and the final lines resonate without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “moonlight fracturing into a thousand diamonds on the water's skin” advances atmosphere and motif. Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (“protected vulnerability incarnate, fragile as sea glass yet armored by solitude”)—slightly mixed metaphor—but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary (“She was wistfully pragmatic,” “There, curled on a weathered piling”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One paraphrase-loop risk: “quivering hush” repeats three times, but its evolution (from ambient to binding to lifting) justifies recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative but occasionally overwrites: “atomically reflective face fracturing light into a mosaic of past lives” borders on purple in a high-pressure beat. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“by the hum of an ancient stone circle” repeats verbatim three times), dulling momentum slightly. Sentence variety is strong, though passive constructions (“was crafted by Aelari hands”) weaken immediacy. Closure image remains sharp despite these frictions—clouds parting, wings unfurled—but artifacts prevent 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“kaleidoscope,” “liquid light,” “rainbow-hued” clustered near climax). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “inevitably whimsical” repeats as a refrain—justified as motif, not artifact. Sentence variety sustains momentum, and the final line (“thread found in twigs and temple light”) recharges the opening beautifully. Minor deduction for figurative density slightly blurring immediacy in the reunion moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“ember against encroaching dark,” “grinding stones in skull”) and coherent. Minor overwriting in closing paragraph (“cautiously hopeful” repeated thrice) borders on scaffold, but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support momentum; no loops or register drift. Final hum resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “starlight pierced… like silver daggers” advances atmosphere, setting, and mood. Sentence variety supports propulsion—long descriptive lines breathe; staccato phrases accelerate crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “flashlight beam cutting the fog like a scalpel” advances atmosphere and character. Figurative language is pattern-taught (opposites woven tight) and pays off (split mask revelation). Minor overwriting in climax (“empathy uncoiling like mist burned by dawn”) slightly muddles metaphor but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every sentence serves plot, character, or tone. Final line (“light unified all”) recharges the ribbon’s duality with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“verdigris patina etched with tiny cartographic glyphs,” “winds howling mockery”), though figurative language occasionally overloads high-pressure beats (e.g., “spongey portent,” “clammy maw” in close succession). Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional rhythm. Minor scaffold appears in the repeated descriptor “nervously confident,” which edges toward template cadence. Still, information density remains high, and the final lines land with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“shard's edges whispering of 19th-century darkrooms” conveys object, history, and mood), but figurative language occasionally overloads high-pressure beats. “Luminous disbelief” repeats four times, creating a near-loop that borders on scaffold; “pixelated amnesty” appears three times with diminishing returns. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but mid-story cadence risks purple prose (“forgiving dots,” “spectral wings”). Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, though one template stem (“Dynamically observant…”) recurs mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: figurative density persists even in high-pressure beats (e.g., Raoul’s confrontation), risking muddle. Phrases like “currency’s veins” and “dragon scales” feel decorative rather than necessary. Minor paraphrase loops (“paths circle back” appears three times with little variation) and scaffolded descriptions dull propulsion. Final paragraph achieves resonance, but earlier overwriting prevents 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but occasional overwriting muddles propulsion: “midnight’s solace yielding to dawn’s promise” risks abstraction. Figurative language appears in most high-pressure sentences without payoff pattern, triggering slight density penalty. No paraphrase loops, but “solace” recurs mechanically, dulling its charge. Final lines (“witness to wonders, they shone”) verge on declarative summary over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“branches arching like drawn swords under a sky of rippling water” establishes setting, tone, and threat). Figurative language is coherent—acidic roots, hungry veins—and avoids muddle. Sentence openings vary (“After…”, “His spell…”, “The air…”, “Thorne…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One paraphrase loop: “warlike serenity” appears thrice; first establishes tone, last reconfigures it, but middle use slightly redundant. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold; momentum never stalls despite lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sap-blood mingled,” “ethereal threads wove from her scar,” “temporal storms” each advance plot, character, and atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. However, three adjacent sentences begin with “Purposefully curious,” creating template cadence (-0.4). Figurative language is coherent (light as veins, dreams as threads), but “anxious elation” borders on label-speak—saved by immediate embodiment (“jittery thrill,” “trembling fingers”).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “roots snaking between bleached bones like veins through marble” establishes motif and texture in one stroke. Figurative language is coherent (fire fails to erase prophecy; blood seals with “fiercely gentle precision”) and avoids purple excess. Minor overwriting in “dusky resolve hardened; she would wander…” slightly stalls momentum, but closure image (“glow lingered… testament to resolve born in bone and root”) redeems with rhythmic payoff. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., carbon dating via rust). Sentence rhythm varies effectively—longer descriptive lines early, tighter clauses during decision. However, adjacent repetitions (“wrested… wrested,” “scrap by scrap”) and three uses of “confidently uncertain” verge on scaffold. No fatal artifacts, but minor loops prevent 9+; closure image remains sharp despite slight overwriting in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “spirit-mass as charged ether” compresses physics and myth efficiently. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“physics of rebirth,” “forbidden mastery”) slightly muddles metaphor coherence, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold.

Closure image (“vine climbed, binding branches anew”) lands cleanly without artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Crafted from the wreckage of old observatories, she cataloged migrating identities”) and avoids loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“shimmering orb riddled with thorns of opposition”) but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching tidal ebb/flow. Final line (“wonder thrived in serene routine”) recharges the opening motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“facets softening like frost under dawn”), though occasional figurative stacking (“resonant hush cloaked… infinite shards… geologic crush”) risks mild overwriting. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final line (“hesitation's pause birthing unity”) resonates without redundancy. One minor register drift (“acquired abandoned hopes”) slightly jars but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ivy-cloaked platforms cracked underfoot” merges setting and embodiment; “bellows patched with yellowing tape in frantic crisscrosses” conveys history in six words. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “submerged secrets, vague harmonies hinting at paths untraveled,” which leans toward abstraction, but peak beats remain concrete. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. One slight redundancy in “raw solace” appearing three times slightly dulls the final image, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“veil fluttering like whispered secrets,” “mists curling like tentative fingers”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths shift with momentum. Minor overwriting occurs in early description (“shelves that stretched into foggy infinities, books humming faintly…”), slightly slowing propulsion. No scaffold or register drift; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure beat is clear and resonant without artifact interference.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats, risking overload. Mixed metaphors are avoided, but “mulberry ache” borders on abstract until embodied in chest and shadows. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically. However, “transparent as frozen tears” and “shivering note that hung… like dew” lean on familiar lyric templates. Closure image (“mended weave”) is clear, but minor register drift (“organic grace”) slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“spirals mirroring aurora coils, fractals echoing the grotto’s vine-laced walls” advances setting, character skill, and plot). Sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, and figurative language is coherent (auroral/static motifs never contradict). Minor overwriting in mid-story (“luminescent powders and silken threads, restoring fleeting dignity”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (vines as lovers’ secrets, clouds parting) and pays off in the scalloping’s “waves of silver light.” Minor overwriting in the ancestral vision (“Visions cascaded…”) leans slightly purple, but closure remains clear. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Final paragraph’s cadence (“turn, return, whole”) crystallizes theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “certainty hardening like frost,” “chimes suspended like oracle bones,” “cloak woven from gray threads that seemed to shift like fog.” However, figurative language occasionally overloads high-pressure beats (e.g., “breeze composing a symphony of selection” borders on purple). Minor paraphrase loops exist (“unhook your absolutes” / “unhook the hook of betrayal”). Still, rhythm varies skillfully, and the final line (“breeze-kissed and free”) resolves with clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often dense with figurative language (“silver hair falling like reversed waterfalls”), creating momentum but occasionally overwriting: “fractal mandalas,” “gravity’s forgotten twin,” and “woven truth carefully” verge on purple. Minor paraphrase loops (“withhold the core method… choosing instead to withhold”) and stacked modifiers dilute peak beats. Final paragraph tightens effectively, but earlier sections carry lyrical excess that blurs causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting risks muddling clarity (“flocks ebbing and surging in chaotic swirls that teased but never clarified”). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “decades layered atop centuries” followed by “centuries of layered dust” slightly dulls momentum. Still, information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes—and the final image lands with crystalline force.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sunlight fractured into hesitant glimmers” establishes tone and physics in one phrase. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“ozone and ozone-tinged glory”) slightly muddles sensory clarity. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines describe mist accommodating weight similarly—trimmable redundancy. Final paragraph’s rhythm falters slightly with abstract phrasing (“dimmed brilliance ready to reignite”), though “folly’s heart, eternally simple” recovers closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “paper lanterns ascended like silent stars” advances atmosphere and stakes. Figurative language is cohesive—light motifs never contradict. Minor overwriting in “bioluminescent fungi pulsing like heartbeats” slightly strains, but momentum holds. Sentence openings vary (“Elias paused,” “Whispers among fishermen,” “He slipped”), and paragraphs breathe with visual rhythm. No loops or scaffold; every line serves character, setting, or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“fossil in the shrunken void,” “stars igniting from ash”), though occasional overwriting appears (“quietly enthusiastic” repeated thrice). Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Minor redundancy in describing coins’ origins, but no paraphrase loops. Figurative coherence holds—amber, static, and doubt motifs interweave without contradiction, sustaining momentum to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “scythe leaned against a brass telescope, its blade dulled by centuries of reluctant harvests” conveys history, emotion, and setting in one breath. Figurative language is mostly coherent (light as prisms of memory), though “translucent gel” for emerging monsters slightly muddles texture. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Deduction for mild overwriting in final paragraph (“stars wheeled overhead, whispering approval”)—elevated diction edges toward sentimentality, dulling closure’s earned poise by 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “bronze fractured like a beggar’s promise” conveys object state and thematic weight). Figurative language is coherent—sapphire, tears, and hum recur without muddle. Minor overwriting in “viscous hum—essence of drowned sailors’ oaths” risks slight density bloat, but clarity holds. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. No loops or scaffold; final line (“dripping precision”) recharges motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “waters receding like a breath held too long” merges setting and emotion economically. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in “spires piercing the surface like forgotten accusations” slightly strains metaphor, but peak beats remain clear. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Twilight faded... they were whole”) achieves earned lyricism without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“prismatic spray scattering rainbows like forgotten jewels”) and strong verbs (“coaxing,” “wheeled,” “converged”). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: three consecutive sentences begin with “The...” near climax, creating slight cadence drag. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language remains coherent (crystal’s “glacial heart,” flame’s “azure heart”). Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with stacked descriptors (“balanced alchemy promising she would emerge whole”), but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“branches twisted like veins,” “mind a forge”) and never muddles causality. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“inventively bridging his solo modifications…”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“Patterns held. Trust preserved…”) earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose propels: varied syntax (fragment “Precisely why I claim it” amid complex descriptions), strong verbs (“convulsed,” “extruding”), and sensory density (“nutrient fluid,” “yin-yang fractals”). Minimal overwriting—figurative language serves causality (Blade “slicing through pretense” literalizes theme). One paraphrase loop: “emotional barrenness” / “emotional numbness” adjacent—but offset by high information density. Closure beat (“sensation electric”) avoids artifact, earning high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “soil-dusted paper with no sender’s mark—a mystery seed mail that whispered of puzzles unsolved”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: stacked metaphors (“velvet hush,” “evolution’s brutal poetry”) slightly blur clarity. No paraphrase loops, but “orthogonal” repetition borders on motif-as-mantra. Final lines resonate without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but propulsive—each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and pressure. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“macerate,” “off-key wind”) and payoff-consistent. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“winds twisting through the tunnel like restless spirits”) edges toward purple, but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s “balm of restored joy amid timeless silence” earns its lyricism through prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “interiorizing exteriors” shown via thorns in veins, vapors in lungs). Minor overwriting in mid-story (“whispering tomes,” “shelved secrets”) slightly dilutes pressure, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes momentum without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: most lines multitask (e.g., “molten silver drawn from the staff's own inlays” conveys method, material, and limitation). Figurative language is coherent—ash blooms, fractured vows, pulsing veins—all rooted in the nexus’s logic. Minor overwriting in second approximation (“heartbeat mocking life”) slightly strains metaphor, but no loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates cleanly into closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-per-line (e.g., “shard of hush... absorbing interference like a black hole for noise”). Minor overwriting in peak beats—“serenely electric pulse synced the array, calming chaotic influx to a poised thrum”—edges toward stacked modifiers but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence recharges opening motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-per-line (e.g., “clocks run sideways” conveys anomaly economically). Figurative language is pattern-taught (sideways clocks → hourglass turned sideways) and pays off. However, slight overwriting in peak beats (“crystalline walls gleamed ethereally, stars piercing through jagged fissures like distant memories”) risks muddling urgency. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“phantom sands ignite in spectral flow” echoes earlier “flicker” imagery redundantly).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-per-line (e.g., “sinew threading through air like veins seeking a heart”). Figurative language is coherent—sinew as tendon/muscle/artery—though slightly overused in climax (“arterial spray,” “veins,” “tendon”). Minor scaffold in “realistically imaginary” repetitions (lines 4, 22, 38), but no paraphrase loops. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with stacked abstractions (“rational enchantment eternally etched”), costing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “schools of phosphorescent fish darted like living constellations” merges setting and metaphor efficiently. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve momentum. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats (“somber marvel” repeated, “wondrous... yet tinged with melancholy”), and “starlit realms accessible through deep-sea rifts” slightly strains physical logic. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density occasionally borders on ornamental near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“mist thickened, carrying a tremor she couldn't ignore”). Figurative language is purposeful (“shadows pooling like forgotten sighs”) and consistent—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“reeling hush” appears thrice), but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm; closure line (“hearts pulsing faintly onward”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “Fluorescent tubes flickered erratically from emergency power, casting shadows in the crashing hush” establishes setting, sound, and mood. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“crashing hush” recurs meaningfully) and avoids muddle. One paraphrase loop (“unremembered pioneers… unremembered no longer”) and slight overwriting in phase-transition description (“molecules loosening, passing through stone as if mist”) prevent 9+. Rhythm varies purposefully; no scaffold or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: metaphors (“snowflakes danced like forgotten stars,” “ink spilled in ephemeral patterns, swirling like nebulae”) are coherent and tied to theme. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and information density is high (each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot). However, slight overwriting in peak beats—e.g., “digital ghost dimmed, at peace, whispering”—edges toward lyric redundancy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-duplicate: “midnight solace” appears three times, slightly diluting its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: “copper-veined storyteller” conveys biology, role, and magic in three words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (bone towers → ribs → language skeleton) and payoff-perfect (diamond’s “trapped scream” light becomes vaulted harmony). Minor overwriting in middle (“fractured loops that drove seekers mad”) slightly bloats, but peak beats avoid muddle. Final paragraph’s cadence—short, echoing sentences—propels closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: “hearts floated toward unspoken loves” compresses emotional physics economically. Sentence variety supports momentum—long sinuous lines for garden description, short bursts for revelation (“Tears froze on her cheeks”). Overwriting risks in peak beats (“quicksilver” metamorphosis) are offset by concrete anchors (arrowhead in palm). No paraphrase loops, though “gravitationally playful” repeats slightly mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (music as pulse, rust as decay), though “resonantly soft” borders on overuse. No paraphrase loops, but slight cadence repetition in middle section (“Ba-dum… resonantly soft”) risks template effect. Final paragraph’s propulsion—vine, shadow, cry—delivers momentum without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information density (“cobalt lights flickering like veins under bruised skin”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (storm = rebellion, voids = yearning) and never muddled in peak beats. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in two mid-story lines (“thunderstorm's breath masking its border dash” edges toward purple), but rhythm varies purposefully and propulsion never stalls. Final line (“bottled vow unbound”) masterfully recharges the opening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet precise, with high information density—e.g., “vines cascaded from cracked skylights, wildflowers nodded in a miniature greenhouse of warped glass” conveys ecology, decay, and hope in one breath. Minor overwriting in peak beats: three consecutive sentences beginning with “The misting hush…” risk template cadence. No paraphrase loops, but “quietly persistent” repeats verbatim (opening and near-end), slightly flattening momentum. Otherwise, syntactic variety and concrete verbs (“pry,” “wept,” “thrived”) sustain propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language (“fractal elegies lined the walls like whispered secrets,” “horocycle's embrace”), though occasionally risks overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., “hyperbolic infinities awaited” near closure). Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm—each ends on a charged image or turn. Minor scaffold: “observed solitude” repeats thematically but not redundantly. No loops or register drift; diction stays within Eliza’s lexicon. Final line (“Eliza dreamed on”) resolves with quiet propulsion, echoing the opening hush.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“whispers,” “light painting”) and pays off. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“translucent bird of iridescent wings, hovering just beyond the breakers”) slightly blurs immediacy. No loops or scaffold; however, “improbable beginnings” repeats without deepening, and “vitalize” borders on label-speak in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “strands shimmering like captured moonlight” conveys image, emotion, and symbol in one phrase. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and paragraphs cut purposefully. However, figurative density borders on overwriting in peak beats (“timelines brushing like whispers across the hush of cosmic possibility”), risking muddle. No loops or scaffolds, but minor synonym churn (“disoriented,” “disorientation,” “disorienting”) slightly dulls propulsion in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with high information density (“glass dome cracked like a shattered lens,” “branches clutched at the gloom”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “holographic tapestry” verges on tech-anachronism for a folklorist’s POV, and “crisp nostalgia” repeats as motif without deepening. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “memories flickered like bioluminescent sparks” followed by “visions flooded back.” Closure beat remains clear despite slight register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “dust motes danced like forgotten specters” sets tone while advancing atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (glass/shadow motifs) and pays off in climax. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“combative tenderness again: her quirk exposed vulnerability…”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm—long descriptive strands yield to clipped commands (“Do it, or rot in echoes forever!”)—propelling to closure without artifacts muddying cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is dense with figurative language—often beautiful—but overwriting blurs clarity in peak beats: “threading these essences into silken strands of light” followed by “one strand pierced the veil” creates mixed textile/light metaphors. Repetition of “radiant hush” (four times) and “budding hope” feels scaffolded rather than resonant. Sentence openings vary adequately, but adjacent lines paraphrase (“succor was needed, not mere words, but a profound aid…”). Final third remains vivid but avoids major artifacts—cost is legible despite minor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose achieves high information density: “porcelain smile” implies fragility and artifice; “starlight wheeled overhead” conveys time passage kinetically. Minimal loops—each image serves multiple functions (prisms refract light, warn via color, mark time). One near-overwrite: “interlaced hush” slightly overused, but pattern-taught early and pays off in closure. Final line’s “knots forever undone” crystallizes theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rainwater had long ago clawed at the frescoes” does setting, mood, and history in one phrase. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with tension. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“sacred voids,” “petrified guardians”) borders on purple but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold—every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Closure beat (“dust motes swirled… spilling parchments”) is clean, concrete, and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (physics metaphors recur and evolve) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“quantum surrender,” “velvet shadow”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional cadence. Final lines (“melancholy sated by analytic clarity”) land with earned precision—no muddle, no redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly precise: “lightning cracked the sky, but thunder lingered unspoken” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—graffiti as “living ink,” ghost as “digital specter”—with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“fingers closing on a peculiar relic… bore etched grids like a cipher wheel”), where description slightly stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold; final lines resonate without redundancy. One paraphrase near “driftingly alert” repeated thrice borders on tic but serves motif.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“frost-laced clouds swirling beyond the panes” establishes setting, mood, and movement). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as key) and payoff is earned. However, the meta-comment about word count is a severe line-level artifact that disrupts closure momentum. Also, “affectionate detachment” in the final sentence leans toward label-speak, slightly dulling the ending’s tactile power.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language, though occasional overwriting appears (“starlit supernova,” “velvet detonation”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but some metaphors border on excessive (“iridescent tears refracting starlight into prisms of regret”). Sentence variety sustains momentum, and the final line resonates by reprising motifs without redundancy. Minor register strain in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fractal recursions in description and structure) and pays off in the sky-mirror. Zero paraphrase loops; varied syntax avoids monotony. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “fractally precise strokes of posture, gesture, and light”—one stacked modifier—but clarity at closure remains pristine. Final line (“the stillness held her masterpiece aloft”) perfectly recharges the opening hush.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “stranded luminance, ethereal light trapped in crystalline motes” risks stacked modifiers. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“diligently curious” repeated; “sociably” used four times). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports momentum, but figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., climax) borders on purple without payoff. No fatal artifacts, yet line-level polish isn’t flawless—cost clarity at closure slightly dulled by ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist clung… like forgotten sighs,” “auroras bled faint light.” Figurative language is coherent (eclipse = shadow = silence = loss) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in climax (“prismatic ghosts of memory”) slightly muddles causality but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“His gloved hands…”, “In the library’s…”, “At last…”). Final line crystallizes motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“Brambles tore at their skin, yielding fruits that sustained but never satisfied”). Figurative language is consistent—light motifs (chalk, nebula, dew) cohere without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“doubt thorned their unity”) slightly strains metaphor, but peak beats remain clear. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence (“Hope, once thorn-bound, now soared free on butterfly wings”) earns its lyricism through prior buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with high information yield per line, yet momentum never stalls. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “fractal veins that mimicked the scars of forgotten wars” and “galaxies within galaxies” risk stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines (“spirals within spirals, each flaw a doorway...”) edge toward redundancy. These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “brass feathers clattered in graceless spirals” conveys sound, motion, and theme in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (orchard fruits as “forgotten regrets,” paths as “drunken veins”). Minor overwriting in “prismatic beauty” and “marble skin” slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“cursing all the while”) lands with rhythmic inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “pebbles smoothed by centuries of water's weave” merges time, texture, and metaphor. Few loops, but minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“foam danced in ephemeral lattices, bubbles diverging in frothy divergence…”—redundant “diverging/divergence”). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Closure beat (“butterflies returning to new chrysalises”) is clean, though “symphonic fervor” slightly muddles voice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “14,792 silent dinners” conveys backstory, emotion, and method in one phrase. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“moonlight flared, scattering motes like mindful confetti”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative coherence maintained—glass, light, and void motifs interlock without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “remorse stored in crystalline droplets” does triple duty (image, concept, character). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in “ghostly figures reliving torments” risks abstraction, but immediate grounding (“icebound glow”) recovers clarity. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: phrases like “vigorously tender” and “star-glint trailing” border on mixed-register strain. A few paraphrase loops exist (“silos of suspicion widening the rifts” / “widening the rifts” implied again later). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports emotional beats, but figurative density in high-pressure moments (e.g., pulley release) risks blurring cause/effect. Still, information density is high, and the final image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but over-dense in high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence carries figurative language (“moonlight cascaded like fractured silver,” “shadows coiling into spectral figures”), creating a purple-prose effect that dulls propulsion. Repetitive stems (“chaotically precise” x3, “helix” x7) and paraphrase loops (“profound transformation” restated four times) trigger scaffold penalties. The final paragraph’s cadence feels templated, undermining the uniqueness of the closing vision.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“mist coiling like forgotten thoughts”), varied in rhythm, and advances atmosphere and plot simultaneously. Yet figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax without pattern payoff, risking overwriting; phrases like “latent blaze” recur without deepening. No loops or scaffolding, but the density occasionally borders on purple without grounding in tactile immediacy during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (trees as orchestra, cracks as notes) and never muddled. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines (“woodwinds rising from alders as cracks sang of ancient gales, their pitches bending with remembered force”), slightly blurring propulsion. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts are purposeful, and the final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “pawns toppled like fallen ideals” conveys politics, metaphor, and backstory). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with scene needs. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“magnetic fields weaving anew”) slightly dilutes clarity, and one paraphrase loop exists (“fragile renewal” / “promise half-reclaimed”). Otherwise, syntax serves pressure, verbs are strong, and the final line (“ready to seek beauty anew”) echoes the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: “silence pulsed like a held breath” advances atmosphere and stakes. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“deep indigo for tension, shimmering gold for release”) risks decorative metaphor, but pays off by linking color to emotional calibration. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. One paraphrase near climax (“raw and genuine, pleading... as one soul to another”) slightly redundant, but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rotting flesh, mingled with overripe fruit—Elara gagged, vision blurring, yet she breathed deep” compresses sensation, reaction, and choice. Figurative language is pattern-taught (smell as narrative, motion as life) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “tidal wave crashing her awareness” slightly muddles peak beat, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports emotional cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “crystalline fruits swelled impossibly on gnarled branches” conveys biology, paradox, and beauty in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent—echoes coil like smoke, rivers thread like starlight—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “whirling silence profound as a tomb” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“roots quickening… smiled”) earns its resonance without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield (e.g., “containers toppling like pins, crushing warehouses, roads, lives” compresses consequence economically). Figurative language is purposeful (“engines howling like banshees”) and coherent within the wind/storm motif. Minor scaffold appears in repetitive “rapidly adapting” phrasing (lines 6 and 15), and “singular convergence” borders on label-heavy. No loops or simultaneity errors, but slight overwriting in mid-section (“digital web mapping how air currents had surged...”) briefly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“birthing the first prism-song… liberated stroke”), where figurative density borders on self-conscious, but never obscures causality. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts are precise. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid but over-ornamented in high-pressure beats: “avalanchingly quiet” repeats three times, and metaphors like “silence crashing down heavier than any landslide” border on mixed logic (avalanche vs. crash). Sentence openings vary well, but “canyon hush” becomes a scaffolded refrain. Still, information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot—and closure image (“worlds forever woven in his soul”) avoids purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“golden facets gleamed under the ebbing night sky where stars vanished one by one”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow, math/emotion) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“memories of past borrows flashing: a poet's whimsy, a soldier's rage”) edges toward summary, but rhythm recovers. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“rock into ethereal crystal,” “hammering stars into blades”) and avoids loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm: fragmented urgency during the meeting, flowing cadence in mythic reflections. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“sympathetically linking past to promise”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no mixed metaphors or register drift. Final line (“coaxing the world awake”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“frost patterns bloomed like neural maps of forgotten sorrows”) and high information density. Minor overwriting in one beat: “reds bled anger… blues wept the night” slightly strains metaphor coherence. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Final paragraph’s “mist eternal witness” borders on abstraction but earns it through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and musical, but figurative language borders on overuse in high-pressure beats (“threads glowed, puzzle edges locking firm… amber bead flared”). Minor paraphrase-loop risk in “silence raveling tighter… raveling silence deepened.” Still, rhythm varies, sentence openings diversify, and information density remains high. Closure image is sharp, though “stoically sparkling” repeats without fresh inflection—cost clarity intact but texture slightly thickened.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “azure-fruited trees whispered,” “rubble trembled,” “silk tightened like a vow.” Figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off—azure recurs as color, emotion, and rebellion. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“echoes building like a forge bellows”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm crystallizes theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (e.g., “velvet hush of alien winds, metallic tang of distant storms”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and paragraph cuts heighten momentum. Overwriting flares mildly in peak beats (“verdant fire,” “infinite greens”), but pattern is taught early and pays off. One paraphrase loop: “weight of truth” / “truth’s weight” / “withheld truth’s weight” across adjacent lines slightly dulls propulsion, but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative (“waves clawed,” “luminescent ache,” “shadows twisted like grasping fingers”), but one paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “No—that exceeded; trim in mind, but wait, counts build. / Harlan watched, eyes softening. Wait, recount precisely later.” These meta-comments read as drafting artifacts, briefly obscuring cause/effect. Otherwise, high information density, varied syntax, and concrete verbs (“hauled,” “pried,” “shoved off”) sustain propulsion. Closure image remains sharp despite minor mid-text clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“news now whispered through spectral signals”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow motifs) and payoff-rich (shadows “leaching from the sea”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“vortex of possibility”) slightly dilutes clarity but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support escalation, though one paraphrase-loop (“steer tempests… guiding wind and wave”) warrants slight deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“stories clung to her like dew on spider silk”). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language coheres (mist as “hushed wonder,” heartbeats syncing with tales). However, slight overwriting in peak beats (“iridescent caution flared… fragile veins warning that unchecked brilliance could shatter”) edges toward mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffolding, but one paraphrase near climax (“magnet's force crush the bearer” echoes earlier “magnetized narratives”).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet clear: “brass arms bent like grieving limbs” does triple duty (image, emotion, object state). Sentence variety avoids monotony; paragraph cuts align with ritual beats. Figurative language is coherent—sorrow “quantified,” dreams “pinned to parchment”—no mixed metaphors. Minor density in peak beats (“3,204 arguments with the indifferent sky”) serves theme without muddle. Closure line (“map not stars, but subtle graces”) resonates without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with imagery but avoids overwriting in peak beats; figurative language serves propulsion (“notes danced, pulling motes of light”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. However, slight synonym churn appears (“fragments swirled,” “scattered memories aligned”) and one paraphrase loop (“communities reforming… communities' voices joined”). These minor artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ range; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“enlarged tranquility,” “paradoxes unfolding like pages in a nested riddle”), but pattern is taught early and pays off. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, especially near midnight’s approach. Minor scaffold in mid-story (“Her reclusive life now deepened…”) briefly summarizes what could be shown. No loops or artifacts that obscure closure; final lines earn their lyricism through accumulated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“snapped like accusations,” “steam curl like confessions”) and pays off in the closure. Minor overwriting appears in “earthly and nostalgic, evoking the bakery's dawn glow—sacred routines of kneading and proofing that had normalized into oblivion,” where abstraction slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, syntax varies naturally, paragraphs breathe with emotional cadence, and no loops or scaffold mar the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“quartz hush,” “cloud-forged silver” verge on ornamental). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve momentum. However, repetitive phrasing (“gently meticulous” used thrice identically) and stacked modifiers (“luminous vows that once bound realms… flickered now like dying stars”) create minor loops. No clarity loss at closure, but the artifact of refrain repetition slightly dulls propulsion in mid-section—still, information density remains high, with most lines advancing atmosphere, plot, or character.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dripping timbers overhead groaned like weary guardians” merges setting and metaphor without muddle. Sentence openings vary (“Lila clutched…”, “Heart pounding…”, “Hours waned…”), and paragraphs shift rhythm with rising tension. Minor overwriting in “comforting unease” repetition (used 3x)—a scaffold loop that slightly dulls the final echo. No register drift or syntactic monotony; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“vine-wrapped tower,” “micro-vortices swirled”), each line advancing atmosphere or character. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“ribbons of emerald and violet,” “sweet, electric tang”) risks figurative saturation, but pattern is taught early and pays off in closure’s austerity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One slight simultaneity blur (“auroral winds whipped… while firefly drones tallying”) but clarity preserved. Final lines achieve earned concision without sacrificing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and precise, with high information density (“charcoal-fingered hands trembling in the auroral glow”), though occasional figurative stacking (“bottled storm raging beneath his practical facade”) borders on excess. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths modulate rhythm, and every line advances character or atmosphere. Minor scaffold in “motivation burned now… inescapable calling thrummed” slightly paraphrases, but closure remains sharp and unmarred.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“crystal lung,” “verity’s veins”) and varied rhythm, avoiding syntactic monotony. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot—e.g., “Her leaves nearby perked up, sensing the map's inherent honesty” conveys both setting rule and emotional shift. Minor overwriting in “shimmering leaves coated in salvaged gold dust” slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glistens cascaded… refracting light into rainbows that struck the bells” merges action, image, and consequence. Minor overwriting in early paragraphs (“etched ancient hymns into the stone”) slightly slows momentum, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Sentence variety sustains rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Final line (“sacred spectrum”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“vines lashed out, thorns piercing irrigation lines” conveys action, consequence, and setting). Syntax varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, mild overwriting appears in peak chaos (“clown-maws snapping, spider-limbs probing”)—figurative density risks muddle, though coherence holds. No loops or scaffold; information density remains high without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from figurative density in high-pressure beats: “sandstorm calm” repeats like a refrain, and metaphors stack (“voices calling plans,” “healed chorus,” “serene eye”) without payoff. Minor paraphrase loops (“listening heals… listening proved… listening endured”) dilute propulsion. Sentence openings vary adequately, but cadence occasionally drifts into template rhythm during storytelling sequence. Closure beat remains clear despite ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fins propelling her forward” advances action while evoking spider-motif. Figurative language is pattern-taught (web/spider/dice) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “lethal gambles turned triumphant”—slightly abstract for peak beat—but compensated by concrete follow-up (“body the lyrical key”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence multitasks (e.g., “hull groans warned of instability” conveys setting, stakes, and urgency).

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“pockets of gravity had emerged from the whale's dying throes” establishes concept and stakes). Figurative language is coherent (whale as “forgotten monument,” crystals “pulsing faintly”). One minor loop: “fluctuating mysteriously” repeats unnecessarily. Otherwise, syntax varies, paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, and closure line (“guardian of the unseen”) recharges the opening lantern imagery without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often doing double duty (e.g., “paper edges crisp as forgotten stars” conveys texture and mythic weight). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “smoothed hush” appears four times with minimal variation, creating a subtle loop. Mixed metaphor risk in “tranquil blaze” persists without full reconciliation—fire and calm remain conceptually strained. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but mid-text synonym churn (“hush,” “quiet,” “stillness”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “murmurs grew insistent,” “stars plummeting like revelations.” Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“cosmic glow,” “mysteriously familiar as kin”) edges toward register drift but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Final line—“it replied in kind”—resolves with elegant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or ritual mechanics. Strong verbs (“unfurled,” “choked,” “coiling”) avoid modifier crutches. However, adjacent lines occasionally verge on paraphrase (“isolation had been her prison… archiving would forge independence”) and figurative density peaks near climax (“twisted arbors like a dying aurora”) flirt with overload. No loops or scaffold, but minor compression could heighten propulsion in middle beats without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled; figurative language serves theme (e.g., “crimson welling like ink”). However, high-pressure beats suffer slight overwriting: “symphony of forged edicts,” “ancestral memory,” “spectral grasp” verge on mixed metaphor density. Minor scaffold in “wisdom had endured through exile’s chill”—tells rather than embodies. Final paragraph avoids loops, but earlier sections show two adjacent lines restating “forgiving the unfinished.” Closure remains clear despite these hairline artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“armor gleamed like frozen tears,” “intrigue peaking—profit in echoes that persisted”), though occasional overwriting appears (“serpentine nexus sighed, melancholy winds carrying her departing song into eternity”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and structure. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “webs of intrigue spun by shadowed figures” borders on cliché. Final paragraph maintains propulsion and clarity, with the last line resonating as a charged reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “breath fogging the air like borrowed starlight” establishes setting, mood, and motif in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally with paragraph cuts mirroring ritual beats. Figurative language is coherent (ice as vow, dreams as cameos) and never muddled in peak moments. Minor overwriting in “viscous pool... veins of quartz” slightly dilutes propulsion, but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but largely disciplined, with high information density and rhythmic variation. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: phrases like “scintillatingly somber” and “demure audacity” verge on ornamental repetition. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines (“fireflies converged… their lights mirroring…” / “fireflies flanked him… their glows pulsing…”). No fatal loops, but slight overwriting in peak beats prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “confetti-like shreds,” “milky with internal fractures,” “dust devils died unborn” do triple duty. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise (“curses were the opium of the irradiated”) and consistent. Final line echoes opening (“mask fogging once more”) with reweighted meaning—no artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“lightning etching prophetic runes across the cobalt portico” advances setting, plot, and motif), but occasional overwriting blurs clarity: “whimsically promising empires rebuilt on shifting sands” stacks modifiers without grounding. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, yet figurative density peaks unevenly—Mira’s sabotage beat suffers slight abstraction (“frequencies fracturing into chaos”). Final paragraph achieves propulsion and resonance, though “gritty, whimsical, inexorable” edges toward label-speak. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph cuts serving emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “wind-sculpted sands pressed against crooked timbers like forgotten dreams” establishes rhythm and motif in one stroke. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“positively wistful,” “lonesome splendor”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “ethereal vapors twist like auroras”—slightly strained—but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: most sentences advance plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (“key’s jagged iron teeth etched with runes that pulsed faintly against his palm”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“fleshly” recurs purposefully) and avoids muddle, though “orgasmic clarity” risks tonal dissonance. Minor scaffold in “logically emotional” repetition (three uses), but no loops or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with stacked participles (“body thrumming… flesh and spirit entwined”).

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“jagged stars,” “oiled veins,” “crystalline webs”), though occasional figurative stacking (“heart a storm restrained, pacing… to sculpt patience”) borders on overwriting in mid-tension beats. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and information density is high—e.g., “neural clamps powered by the viaduct’s pulsing fields” conveys world, stake, and mechanism in one phrase. Minor redundancy in “softly purposeful” repetition slightly dulls propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“subterranean veins pulsing with water,” “graffiti overlaying century-old chisel marks”—and avoids scaffold loops. Sentence openings vary (“Rain finally broke…”, “She was watchfully calm…”, “Kneeling by…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “entangled memories bleeding into Elara’s, entangled like roots” risks mixed metaphor, but clarity holds. Final lines propel momentum: “lantern swinging, memories disentangled but etched forever” recharges the motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language (“dust motes danced like silent fireflies,” “rain lashing... like accusatory fists”), though near the climax, metaphors slightly overload (“golden shafts piercing the gloom like divine mercy”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Minor deduction for one mixed vehicle (light as both “shaft” and “mercy”) that briefly muddles physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “corrosive waves gnawed,” “brass beast crammed with fractured mirrors” advance atmosphere and character. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“loops of want, feedback of ache”) slightly dilutes propulsion. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She’d built…”, “Back in…”, “Through…”). Final paragraph’s cadence (“glided eternal”) resonates without scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“viral rust”) triggers −0.3, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose has high information density (“echoes of human connections faded into sensed absence”) and varied syntax, but minor scaffold appears: “She composed a query… then hesitated” followed by redundant “cursor blinking in the sensed absence.” Figurative language (“glitch in the matrix of loss”) is coherent, though “cold case thawed in absence’s heart” slightly strains metaphor. Final paragraph avoids loops, but “sensed absence lifted, if only for her” edges toward abstraction without concrete anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“edges sharp as betrayal,” “minions stilled, dryad’s leaves unfurled slightly”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence variety supports rhythm: short punches (“War loomed.”) amid flowing descriptions. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shadows knitting light from the beacon downward”) borders on figurative excess but doesn’t obscure clarity. Final line (“balanced on such quiet courage”) resonates without scaffold—every phrase advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hulls groaning under pressure ridges,” “fold in patience, a soft crumpling sigh like silk tearing slowly.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (wind as carrier of sound/solace) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “fragile chimes” and “ethereal glow” slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic resolution—breath-like cadence carrying “windborne solace” forward.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is often beautiful but over-ornamented: metaphors stack (“heart echoing the engine's dying growl,” “words spilling like overripe fruit,” “amber glow wrapping her like a lover's tentative embrace”) without pattern-teaching, dulling peak moments. Repetitive stems (“amber,” “mismatch,” “vine”) create near-loops, and elevated diction (“nurture intersubjective understanding,” “passionate subtlety”) clashes with natural speech rhythms. Final paragraph’s “rediscovered in the night's subtle passion” risks purple prose. Information density is high, but propulsion suffers under decorative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (“sands sighed softly against silken drapes”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “golden veins and tremors,” “luminous remnants”—but metaphors stay coherent. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One paraphrase near climax (“consecration flowed… echoes poured”) slightly dulls propulsion, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: metaphors stack (“scent a soft veil over the earth's old wounds,” “vines climbed... like patient fingers”) without pattern-teaching payoff. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“perceptively calm” repeated; “arcs” described three ways in close proximity). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with scene needs. However, high figurative density in peak beats dulls propulsion slightly—every line sings, but few advance causality. No scaffold or simultaneity errors, but lyricism occasionally supersedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield (“words had ossified then, etched eternally in ink”). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—crystal as oracle, hush as cobweb silk—and never muddles peak beats. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“fractured sequences surged again…”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines achieve rhythmic closure with echoing cadence (“Forever growing, silently”).

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “beard threaded with wire scraps from demolished cars” conveys history, texture, and identity). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “crystalline purity” slightly abstracts the nexus moment. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (tide, bone, tape). Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors earned peace—but “analogue waves” risks slight anachronistic vagueness in a tactile world.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“stars smearing like tears,” “luminous pearl in the void”) and avoids scaffold loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“primal fury,” “hypnotic vortex”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. Final lines land with clean propulsion: “Above the clouds, time flowed true” resolves motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: metaphors stack (“sunlight pierced… like golden threads,” “grooves cracked like fault lines”) without always advancing pressure. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“hymned the mundane” → “hymning the mundane” → “hymns to coffee mugs”). Final paragraph’s “humming softly, her decisively kind heart pulsing” verges on label-speak. Still, rhythm varies, sentences propel, and key images land—just shy of 8.2 due to figurative saturation in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brass rod spiraled with micro-etched runes, its teeth shaped like interlocking shadows” does triple duty (image, object, motif). Figurative language is coherent—shadows “flee,” gears “stir,” chimes “muffled by fog”—without muddle. Minor scaffold: “quietly deliberate” repeats thrice, slightly diluting impact. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Her fingers...”, “Deep in...”, “As she turned...”). Closure beat remains artifact-free, preserving clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (cleft as motif across tooth, certainty, sundial). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“innovated the horizon,” “nostalgic riot”) slightly dilutes propulsion. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Closure beat remains clear despite elevated diction.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is vivid but over-ornamented: “serpentine grotto shrouded in mist,” “zephyr of celestial petals,” “frosted emerald shard” cluster in high-pressure beats without payoff, triggering density penalties. Repetition of “resurfaced” (4x) and “reflectively vibrant” (3x) creates paraphrase loops. Final paragraph’s “bloomed like a zephyr-kissed flower” echoes opening without deepening, feeling decorative. Sentence propulsion falters under stacked modifiers, dulling the climax’s momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “sweet and insulating as preserved nectar” or “neural networks long extinct” flirt with mixed metaphor. However, figurative language is mostly purposeful and pattern-taught (icicles → code → neural networks). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One paraphrase-loop risk in describing the hush twice, but momentum holds. Closure beat remains clear despite ornamental tendencies elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Strong verbs (“swirling hush,” “fractured dreams,” “spinning counter to rusted mechanisms”) avoid modifier bloat. Minor overwriting in two high-pressure beats (“luminous girl in a tattered gown, her hope shaped like a soaring bird”) edges toward stacked metaphor, but coherence holds. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final line (“walked against the current, whole”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“gathering hush draped the twisting branches like a silken veil” establishes tone, setting, and motif). Sentence variety supports momentum, though occasional figurative stacking (“golden stories, luminous narratives”) risks slight density overload. No loops or scaffold; every image pays off (e.g., vine tendril introduced, used, reweighted). Minor deduction for near-purple phrasing in peak beats, but clarity at closure remains unharmed. Read-aloud rhythm is musical without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “veins bulging like roots seeking water” conveys physiology, metaphor, and motivation in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (alchemical fire = blue/patient; starlight = imprisoned radiance) and pattern-taught early. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in middle passage (“Hours bled…”), but closure image (“map of heartbeats, sealed forever”) lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “dust motes like spectral chaff,” “winds moaned at the entrance like distant mourners.” Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with diurnal rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“symphonies” of whispers, “harmonious frenzy”) slightly blurs causality but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere, character, or method. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated (“he noted,” “he glimpsed”).

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figuration (“rivulets traced silver paths,” “starlight pierced like needles”), but occasional overwriting risks muddling peak beats—e.g., “boundary-lessly trapping her within their endless recursion” borders on abstract. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “shingled hush” repeats functionally rather than ornamentally. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and the final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the closure. Minor deduction for one strained modifier (“bone-deep trance”) amid otherwise masterful control.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“wood dust sifted like fine sand” implies time passing). Figurative language is pattern-taught (crystals = “crystallized time”) and payoff-integrated (locket contains them). Minor overwriting in “lion’s mane fungi” slightly strains plausibility, but closure remains unharmed. Sentence variety supports momentum: no template cadence or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “viscous waters propelled by unseen winds into eternal, languid swirls” establishes setting, tone, and paradox in one breath. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors; “regret coiled in his gut, a serpent” pays off later in action. Minor scaffold in “ambitions—once sharp as scavenger blades—lay worn to nubs” slightly borders cliché, but earns redemption through tactile follow-through. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Above the clouds... Elias dreamed...”) varies rhythm purposefully, avoiding monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “maze of intentions,” “conduits snaking like veins,” “rust flaked away in rivulets.” Figurative language serves causality—no purple prose. Minor scaffold in “functionally creative” repetition (−0.2), but no loops or register drift. Closure beat (“humming with quiet promise”) avoids artifact interference.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “glacial hush” appears four times, “excruciatingly gentle” three, creating rhythmic redundancy. Mixed metaphor risk in “petrichor nostalgia… thorns but petals” slightly muddles sensory logic. Yet line-level propulsion remains strong—sentences vary in length, paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence, and key images (“tears welled, unspoken in the hush”) land with clarity. Final third avoids scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but occasional overwriting dilutes peak beats. Phrases like “velvet indigo” or “calm storm” flirt with purple prose, and “serene upheaval” repeats as a near-loop (three times), risking scaffold. Yet rhythm varies skillfully, paragraph lengths breathe with tension, and concrete verbs (“poled,” “probing,” “splintering”) anchor abstraction. Final lines land cleanly, though one or two modifiers could be pruned for sharper propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“prismatic veins,” “oceanic hush” repeated). Sentence openings vary well; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Minor redundancy in “infinitely patient” (used thrice), though partially justified as motif. Fulgurite description borders on ornamental but pays off in decoding. Overall propulsion remains strong, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but occasional overwriting risks clarity. Phrases like “bruised purple by dusk” and “arterial blood yet soft as a lover’s sigh” verge on mixed metaphor, though cohesion holds. Minor scaffold in “projecting presences via the thread wove him into the garden’s tapestry” slightly abstracts a pivotal beat. Otherwise, syntactic variety, strong verbs (“crunching,” “unraveled,” “silvering”), and paragraph cuts serve momentum. Final line’s “steps lighter on the path of gold” resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“steam whispering like a lover’s sigh,” “feathers born from reptilian regret”), though occasional overwriting risks muddle (“bitterly sweet, a chirp twisted midway between melody and rasp”). Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One paraphrase loop slightly dulls momentum (“quaking reverie… quaking galleries… quaking soul”), but closure remains sharp—no artifacts obscure the chick’s emergence or thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “obsidian shards gleamed like forgotten blades,” “crimson silk cord—red as fresh lava yet soft as compassion.” Minor overwriting in “puckered wounds of survival, much like her own forearms”—slightly redundant after earlier scar description. No loops or scaffold; every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s “kelp-drift peace enfold her” slightly echoes earlier phrasing but earns resonance through closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“marble basins cracked under veils of moss and dust” establishes setting, decay, and mood). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/water motifs) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in mid-section: “echoes of laughter… secrets of lovers’ vows… city’s vibrant pulse” risks synonym churn. Final paragraph avoids purple excess, landing cleanly on “cosmic subtlety.” No loops or scaffold; propulsion syncs with Elara’s patience—slow build, sharp release.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or pattern. Figurative language is consistent (petals as warnings, light as knowledge) without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“generational patterns unfolded… only to ensnare themselves”) edges toward summary, slightly dulling immediacy. Final lines avoid scaffold—“petals sighed onward” reprises opening with reweighted resonance. No loops or template cadence; rhythm varies organically.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“fractured glass panes caught the fading sun like shattered memories”), yet avoids overwriting—each metaphor serves theme or character. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence matching the migration’s ebb. Minor flaw: slight repetition of “fiercely meditative” (used three times), but not in adjacent lines. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“ready to trade poems anew”) lands with earned resonance, no scaffold or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“froth that hissed like damned souls,” “pendulum bob swaying hypnotically”), though figurative language occasionally overloads high-pressure beats (e.g., “volcanic fire ignited them” risks mixed metaphor). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor deduction for slight cadence repetition in the inscription list (“Wound true… Resisted shortcut… Confessed sabotage…”), though this may be intentional patterning. Final line’s poetic closure (“ally in redemption”) earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting risks clarity (“voiceless murmurs of the past defying all maps of memory”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and revelation. Minor scaffold in “tenderly organized” repetition, but not looped. Final third avoids artifacts—closure beat (“tenderly refolded”) is clean. Information density high: each line advances atmosphere, character, or mystery without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“feathers of discarded drafts littering the floor like fallen stars”), and sentences vary rhythmically to mirror tension. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Slight overwriting in peak beats (“infinitesimal from union...”) edges toward abstraction, but the kingfisher quill’s iridescence and mineral ink anchor it. Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished: “tendrils of fog curled like forgotten melodies” and “prickly promise of hidden sparks” border on purple in early beats. However, figurative language pays off—the “thistled calm” motif reweights at closure, and sentence rhythms vary purposefully. Minor redundancy in “secretly luminous” repetition, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph avoids summary, resolving through image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously (“mask's cracks caught the dim glow, mirroring the gallery's core deceit”). Rhythm varies effectively—long, tapering sentences mimic vanishing points; short clauses mark ritual actions. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “glowing ruin,” “brittle remnants,” “imperishable grains” verge on stacked modifiers, slightly dulling emotional rawness. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “crystallize a fleeting emotion” appears twice. Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “brass tooth etched with nautical almanacs, survivor of salt and pressure”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“pulsed like false heartbeats,” “voice echoing like gravel in a sieve”) and pays off in the cog’s “second pulse.” Minor overwriting in the third layer description (“silt caking his beard, heart pounding against rational resolve”) slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line (“his endured”) risks abstraction but is anchored by the ticking cog.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled: metaphors (“amber sigils,” “mandala of silenced storms”) serve the Accumulative lens without muddling. Sentence openings vary (“In the velvet library…”, “She was expectantly resigned…”, “One autumn evening…”), and paragraphs breathe with scene needs. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“braid diverse voices into harmony, drawing threads from fractured souls”) slightly reduces propulsion. No loops or scaffold, though “denoted”/“denote” recurs with near-synonym risk.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most lines multitask (e.g., “callused hands brushing dew-slick leaves that hummed” conveys touch, sound, character, setting). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“synaptic plasticity stirring not just in minds but in roots and cells”) edges toward abstraction, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; information density remains high. Final line (“a testament to creation amid decay”) resonates without summarizing. One hairline slip: “informally wise” borders on label-speak but is immediately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “nectar dusk settled… like spilled honey” establishes tone, setting, and motif in one stroke. Sentences vary rhythmically, paragraph cuts heighten tension (e.g., after “Strike true to light the hidden hive”). Minor overwriting in “bruised sky” and “rickety cage of iron and glass” borders on stacked modifiers, but figurative coherence holds. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence (“hum again, but changed—wonder toll paid in full”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“cherry blossoms drifted like forgotten sighs,” “translucent sliver of pure quietude”), though occasional overwriting appears (“earthly potency,” “subdued fire”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor figurative stacking in the sanctification scene slightly blurs clarity, but rhythm varies effectively. Final line (“the bay whispered its eternal fire”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stone fountains wept slow veils of bubbles” does triple duty (setting, mood, foreshadowing). Figurative language is consistent—water, weaving, light motifs recur with evolving meaning. Minor overwriting in “foxglove-analogous fronds” slightly jars, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors dull closure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“whispering life anew”) resonates without redundancy, earning high information density with zero artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict (“chipped die... talisman of chances imperfectly taken”). Figurative language is coherent (stairs as “golden mean helix,” equations “chasing their own tails”) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats (“quantum fluctuations scaled to macro” risks abstraction), but rhythm varies naturally and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “ink...a quiet rebellion against the gray dawnless hours”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “daydreams cascaded” followed by three vision summaries risks density overload, though pattern is taught. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (light = memory, smog = forgetting). Final paragraph’s “chains unbroken” slightly borders abstraction but is grounded by preceding images.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “rosewater dread perfumed the air, a delicate floral haze…” repeats the concept within one sentence. Figurative language appears in most high-pressure lines (“skeletal forests awaiting spring's cruel kiss”), risking purple prose, though the pattern is taught early. No paraphrase loops, but “thaw” is over-modified (“impending thaw,” “thaw begins,” “post-winter’s grip”). Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, yet “initials etched in memory” slightly abstracts what was previously tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (“fate had designed him for obscurity, born under a cursed star that ticked backward”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“latent radiance reshaped the stars above, fates untangling in reverse cascades”)—slightly strained metaphor. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. Closure image (“soul spun free—beyond design”) resonates without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with evocative imagery but occasionally over-ornamented (“bioluminescent slime trailing from a deep-sea abomination” risks mixed metaphor). Some adjacent lines verge on paraphrase (“glowing husk that craves the dark yet illuminates the vile” / “photographically cursed, I shatter lenses…”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports escalation. However, figurative density in high-pressure beats slightly obscures immediacy, preventing top-tier clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “salt-rimed tattoos that mapped forgotten currents” conveys history, identity, and world logic). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “fractal peaks layering atop primal roar” risks abstraction, but clarity holds. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One near-mixed metaphor: “thunderous applause gone wrong” slightly jars against nautical tone, but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“sunwashed dread pooled like sweat”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as molten gold, shadows as accusing fingers) and pays off in the climax. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“bleaching the air with relentless glare that masked the creeping dread beneath”) slightly muddles causality, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final lines achieve crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: “ivy-choked tunnel” conveys setting, mood, and obstacle in three words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (ivy = deceit) and pays off without muddle. One paraphrase loop: “recapture demanded action beyond thought” followed by “he couldn’t let the letter vanish again” slightly redundantly. Final paragraph’s cadence (“emotionally rational guardian of forgotten rails”) risks purple prose but earns it through earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Cracks spiderwebbed the stone, interlaced absences where mortar had fled”) and varied syntax that mirrors rising tension. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“hushed blaze,” “restrained embers”) and coherently sustained. However, two adjacent sentences restate the inkwell’s role (“holding ink for hasty charts, but tonight it would chronicle more”), triggering a minor paraphrase-loop deduction. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; momentum never stalls. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening, closing the tonal loop without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: high-pressure beats carry multiple metaphors per sentence (“shadows clung... like forgotten regrets”; “truth settled over her like sediment”). Minor paraphrase loops appear (“readjusted her stance... readjusted again”). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, “dappled resolve” and “tranquilly perceptive” repeat as near-synonym anchors, creating a subtle scaffold effect. Closure image (“secrets stirring anew”) avoids purple prose, landing with earned simplicity. No fatal artifacts, but density slightly dulls propulsion in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“shadow peel away like smoke from a dying ember,” “grief uncoiling as shadowy paper”), though occasional overwriting appears (“radiant agony driving him skyward” borders on purple). No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language coheres under the luminous torment motif; no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slightly strained diction in “luminous torment” repetition, but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive. Sentences vary in structure and length to mirror tension—staccato during alarms, lyrical in revelation. Figurative language is controlled (“ghosts from that blood-soaked altar,” “mist made stone”) and coherent. Minor redundancy in “intangibly tangible” phrasing slightly dulls its impact, but no loops or scaffold mar momentum. Final lines land with resonant economy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “dome cracked open like an eyeless socket” establishes tone and foreshadows revelation. Figurative language is consistent (light/dark, sound/silence motifs) without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“brilliant streaks in the dimming vault, Earth's turn painting celestial ribbons”) slightly slows momentum, but propulsion returns at the lever-pull. Zero paraphrase loops; syntax varies effectively. Final line crystallizes the core metaphor without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“sieved hush” appears three times, evolving from description to psychological state). Minor overwriting in mid-story (“intricate whorls etched by long-gone hands… twisted branches for family lines…”) slightly slows momentum, but the final third regains propulsion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively between contemplation and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “furrowed hush,” “storm-worn windblown parapet,” and “waning gibbous moon” establish tone economically. Figurative language is consistent (mist as shroud, wind as lament) without muddle. Sentence variety supports rhythm—long descriptive strands yield to terse dialogue beats. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “fragile timeframe where words could shatter or mend” followed by “trust might flicker” restates tension without progression. Final paragraph’s “recycling folly into enduring wisdom” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by concrete image of Kael’s fading silhouette. No scaffold or template cadence; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “astronomical compass lay shattered in his callused palm, its brass housing cracked from a drunken toss”). Figurative language is controlled—“regrets began their backlash, slithering up like tide pools stirred”—and coherent across the text. Minor overwriting appears in the climax (“faith flickering brighter now, no longer alone”), where abstraction slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “gravitated northward” and “gravitating still” within three lines—harmless but noticeable under elite scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and dense, though occasional overwriting appears (“sterile haze,” “crumpled newspapers,” “pixelated maps in comics depicting glowing underworlds” pile descriptors without propulsion). The phrase “jaded wonder” repeats three times, bordering on scaffold. Sentence variety is strong, but the climax’s “glowing paths forking into infinities” leans into abstraction where concrete sensory detail would better serve causality. Still, momentum holds, and the final paragraph avoids purple excess, landing cleanly on “chosen light.”

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often doing double duty (e.g., “fireflies danced like phoenix embers” links motif and atmosphere). But overwriting accumulates: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“paradoxically steady” appears four times), creating synonym loops. Mixed metaphors surface (“weave their essences,” “loom of moonlight”) that blur causality. Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, yet scaffold phrases like “bonds transcended” verge on summary. Momentum stalls slightly in spice-gathering beat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line: “moon that bloated the sky like a bruised lung” conveys mood, setting, and bodily unease. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “perfumed mist that tasted of forgotten laughter and milk-warm dawns” slightly stacks sensory modifiers—but coherence holds. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Final line (“some beauties must strangle before they set you free”) resonates without redundancy, recharging the opening’s “choking beauty.”

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“stitching wounds with threadbare hope amid bombings”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “phantasmal hand,” “luminous filaments,” “nascent light” verge on stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops, but “ghostly resolve” repeats as a refrain—effective lyrically, yet risks template cadence. Sentence openings vary well; paragraph cuts serve emotional rhythm. Closure beat remains clear despite figurative density, though “happiness surged, pure and unbidden” leans slightly toward label-speak versus embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “penniless and light as sea foam” conveys state and metaphor in six words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“whispering hush” appears three times, evolving from ambient to cosmic) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“vibrant greens, golds, blues igniting like miniature auroras”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure clarity. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary (“He had given…”, “Now, penniless…”, “From the treeline emerged…”), and paragraph cuts always shift knowledge or charge.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line: e.g., “phosphor veins” conveys setting, tech, and theme. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“intricate dance of angles and bronze”—edges toward purple but doesn’t obscure clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Deduction for slight figurative density in final third (“hummed in every lock she touched”) that borders on abstraction without grounding action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“boots whispering over frictionless stone” establishes setting and constraint). Figurative language is coherent (eels as “living smoke,” dust as “trapped infinities”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in climax (“nebula in miniature, pulling visions into focus”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence shift to staccato fragments (“Sacred patterns, at last his own.”) earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but purposeful—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (lightning as veins, scars as meridians) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in “furiously tranquil amid the thunder's roar” risks abstraction, but the phrase earns its place through recurrence and embodiment. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: every sentence advances character, conflict, or atmosphere (“gears whirring like unspoken retorts”). Syntax varies rhythmically—longer sentences for reflection, staccato for fencing—and paragraph cuts heighten momentum. Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (“dignified chaos where intellects would fence until one yielded truth or blood”), but figurative language remains coherent (light/shadow motifs never contradict). No loops or scaffold; the final line (“Dignified chaos reigned victorious”) resonates without redundancy, though “diplomatically fierce” repeats as a slight tic.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but mostly precise—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“moonlight splintered the gloom… luminous shards”) risks figurative saturation, but pattern is taught and sustained. No loops or scaffold; strong verbs (“hefted,” “pry,” “molting”) anchor abstraction. Final line resonates without redundancy, recharging “luminous fracture” with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere (“foam that shimmered like lost stars”). Figurative language is coherent (arbor as “colossal organ”) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“wistful visions haunted him—Lira’s eyes...”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm; final paragraph’s cadence (“Refuge found, encore eternal”) resonates without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (“empirically whimsical flora—flowers that levitated petals only when unobserved”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shelves buckling under forgotten epics”) risks figurative clutter, but coherence holds. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully. Closure image (“petals' light faded into twilight promise”) avoids purple prose while carrying thematic weight. One near-paraphrase (“luminous doubt” repeated) costs 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    High figurative density borders on overwriting: “bruised with cerulean regret,” “roots delving into earth,” “spectral galleon” appear in rapid succession without pattern-teaching payoff. Paraphrase loops occur (“rhythmically placid” used identically three times; “diffuse” repeated mechanically). Final third suffers from register drift—“luminous forgiveness unspoken” reads as abstract thesis rather than embodied insight. Still, sentence variety and sensory specificity salvage momentum in key beats like the pruning scene.
