    Sentences are grammatically clean and information-dense, advancing Mara's hypothesis and the greenhouse's transformation without obvious loops. However, repeated stems ("She realized," "She wrote," "She whispered") and stock phrases ("kindled humility," "quiet power of stripped drama") create mild template cadence in the final third. The final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("an experiment in humility, gradual change, and the quiet power of stripped drama") reads as scaffold that could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She realized… She set out… She followed… She slipped… She understood… She watched… She knew." The final third recycles stems and restates theme through synonym churn ("drifting resonance," "steadily adaptive," "quiet pauses") without adding pressure. Stock metaphor strings ("scorched testament," "quiet canyon under stars," "gentle chorus") and therapy-speak ("purpose," "steady rhythm") dull the closure image. Artifacts touch the ending, triggering cumulative −1.7 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but repeated template stems appear: "She had promised herself," "She set," "She placed," "She activated," "She closed," "She realized," "She lifted," "She felt," "She stepped" across the piece. Figurative language is dense in peak beats ("frozen cathedral," "ghostly harp," "lighthouse beam," "tapestry of sound") without clear pattern-teaching or cost, and phrases like "invisible music" and "silently expressive" verge on oxymoron without grounding. The paraphrase loop in the final two paragraphs (pilgrimage restated, conservatory lingering) adds −0.2. Template cadence and figurative density in high-pressure beats trigger −0.6, and the loops add −0.2, totaling roughly −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence abound: "occupying impossible spaces" appears thrice, "permanent address" four times, "chased stillness" twice, all within tight proximity without reweighting. Figurative density is high in every beat ("patient sigh," "trembling eye," "fractured hope," "sung its soft hymn") with mixed vehicles (a library cannot "breathe," a lens cannot "sing"). Sentence stems recur: "The library's…," "Marlow…," "The light…" Scaffold phrasing like "he believed that," "he understood that," and "the core concept of" front-loads explanation. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the library's glow seeped," "a chased stillness that promised"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "amplified quiet" appears twice in proximity without added pressure; "gently persistent" recurs as a label; "the bell's tone/echo/song" cycles without functional variation. Template cadence dominates ("She would declare… She secured… She spoke of… She reminded… She knew…"), flattening rhythm. Mixed metaphor: "knowledge curled like smoke around the old bell's tone" conflates smoke (dispersing, rising) with sound (traveling horizontally through trees). Stock phrases accumulate: "fireflies," "lullaby for the hungry," "tide," "silent spine," "secret heartbeat." High-pressure beats (midnight runs, elder gathering) receive the same ornamental diction as transit passages, killing propulsion. Paragraph cut test fails repeatedly—many paragraphs restate community endurance without advancing situation or emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence openings, but information density is low—many lines restate the same event in synonym loops: "the tear glowed faintly, pulsing," then "the tear's surface rippled," then "the reservoir brightened, pulsing." Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching ("sleeping dragon," "lantern," "blanket," "river of sparks," "prayer of gratitude stitched") and several mixed vehicles (fog as blanket that peels; filament as fire that fuses). Template cadence appears in parallel "He [verb]" constructions across the middle third. Stock metaphors (light as healing, breath as spirit) lack fresh texture.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy loop and scaffold penalties accumulate: "She believed…only by disintegrate" (verb form error), "the texture of time" repeated three times, "fading photographs" four times in similar constructions, and paraphrase loops ("The garden itself seemed to quiver, a quaking reverie" immediately restates mood already established). Template cadence runs appear ("The fragment…allowed," "The garden's ambient mist carried," "The light refracted," "Each thread sang"). Figurative language is dense but often mixed or vague ("sine wave…shifting in proportion to the observer's heartbeat," "vaporous threads that stitched the present to the past"). These artifacts dull momentum and obscure causal links, triggering −1.4 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "rusted cathedral," "skeletal witnesses," "forgotten throat," "sleeping hearts," and "silent pledge" cluster without breathing room. Paraphrase loops appear ("dust‑covered token dispensers stood as skeletal witnesses" / "the carnival's ruins silhouetted") and template cadence recurs ("She moved… She knelt… She placed… She lifted…"). The final paragraph stacks closures redundantly (shoot emerges, chains rust loose, wall falls, legend confirmed) without propulsive necessity. Clarity holds, but density and momentum suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "cells divide" appears twice in identical phrasing; "trust breaking" and "trust...broken" recur without added pressure; "each memory carried," "each spark a tiny imprint," "each new wearer" impose template parallelism. Figurative language stacks without coherence—"kelp-laden glass," "ashen forge feeding on the void between stars," "metallic lullaby"—mixing registers and vehicles. The final third recycles "the sound of trust breaking and mending" multiple times, dulling the closure image. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched," "understood") cluster in peak beats, flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "liquid dusk," "velveteen case," "luminous disbelief," "whispers urging her to press her ear against destiny's door." Paraphrase loops abound—"illuminated moments" appears six times, "moonbeams" thirteen times, often in near-identical constructions. Template cadence runs ("She [verb]… The [noun] [verb]…") span paragraphs without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphors ("pressed the velveteen case against the rose, feeling the petal's vibration echo like a heartbeat") blur sense. Applying Text Artifact penalties (−0.6 baseline for loops, −0.4 for template runs, −0.3 for register drift into abstraction) and escalating for density at closure: total −1.4 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrases. "Weighty lightness" appears three times without reweighting; "thawing heart" recurs as decoration. The phrase "abandoned control room" is repeated verbatim across beats without causal evolution. Runs of template cadence: "I lift… I breathe… I coax… I set" (intentional chant, acceptable) versus "She began… She abandoned… She set to work… She placed… She knew" (unintentional stem repetition). Stock metaphor "cracked surface of a newly blown sphere" and "liquid glass" feel generic. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and stem runs (Non-closure Accumulation Cap); no artifact touches the closure beat directly, so cap remains ~4.6.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "firmly adaptive" appears three times, "trembling certainty" twice, "betrayal" and "transformation" churn across adjacent sentences without added pressure. Figurative density ("cracked dome," "dust-laden specters," "amber fire") saturates peak beats without coherent vehicle logic. Filter-verb stacks ("sensed," "felt," "realized") and stock metaphors ("second skin," "beacon") dull immediacy. Applied −1.4 for pervasive artifacts touching closure; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    Phrase loops dominate: "ambered hush" appears four times, "marbled hush" four times, "by summarizing silence" three times, creating synonym churn and template cadence without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.8). Mixed metaphors ("phantom serpent" curling, then leaving "perfume of rain-kissed iron") and stacked modifiers ("storm-tossed," "pebble-shore," "flaking gold leaf") reduce clarity in peak beats (−0.5). Many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing cause or choice (paraphrase loops). Information density is low; scaffolding could be cut by ~30% without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.3)
    Several paraphrase loops appear: "amalgamate" recurs four times in adjacent paragraphs without adding new pressure; "looped timelines" is repeated three times in close proximity; "remarkably composed" bookends the piece without evolution. Template cadence is visible in runs like "It recalled… It stepped… It positioned… It realized… It turned…" that flatten rhythm. Figurative language ("tiny comet," "aurora of data," "faint chime") is mixed in density without pattern-teaching or payoff, occasionally obscuring concrete action. The final third contains thematic summary sentences that restate prior content rather than advancing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "ambiguously clear" appears four times; "eavesdrop" recurs without new meaning; "resonant hush" bookends without evolution. Template cadence: "She lifted... She placed... She recorded... She noticed..." across consecutive beats. Purple prose stacks modifiers: "quiet night registrar," "crystal whispering forecourt," "trembling honesty of the walls." Mixed metaphors: "thoughts folded like origami" (solid/flat confusion), walls with "trembling honesty" (anthropomorphism without grounding). Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and trigger −1.2 in Q7 (loops, template runs, metaphor muddle).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "a reminder that even truths can fracture" immediately follows "feeling the cold edges like a reminder," and "the maze itself had learned" echoes "the garden had indeed noted his measured steps" within three paragraphs. Template cadence runs stack ("He lifted… He whispered… He knelt… He felt… He bowed") without variation. Stock phrasing ("eyes reflecting the duality," "settle like dew on his skin") and mixed metaphors ("walls breathing," "lattice of truth," "tiny sun," "inner fire") cluster in peak beats, obscuring causal links. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the station's core emitted a faint hum around a magnetic nexus at twilight" / "the magnetic nexus at twilight intensified" / "the magnetic nexus at twilight pulsing like a distant lighthouse" recycle the same phrase without added pressure. Template cadence appears in successive "The station's…" and "Lira…" stems. Figurative density ("like a violin bow on frozen strings," "taste of cold fire," "sea of stars") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, muddling register. "Icy warmth" repeats as a stock oxymoron rather than evolving image. Synonym churn ("hush of beating wings at rest," "quiet wingbeats still suspended") restates without advancement. These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated diction ("trembling like breath," "water's caress carve," "sigh that seemed to echo the ghost's own breath," "hush of unstruck chords settle like gentle water"). Template cadence in several moves ("She lifted... She pressed... She placed..."). Mixed metaphor: "water's caress carve new symbols" (caress vs. carve). Paraphrase loops appear ("wordless conversation" / "wordless exchange," "in between spaces" repeated four times). Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("seemed to speak," "seemed to smile," "felt the pressure"). Density −0.7, coherence −0.5, loop −0.4 = cumulative −1.6 in Q7. Artifacts do not obscure causality but dull line-level momentum and clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting and paraphrase loops: "swaying certainties" appears three times; "weight of truth" and synonyms (stone, heavy/light) recur without added pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("bruised gold," "brittle leaf," "peripherally aware," "occupying margins," "feather caught in a gale") without teaching a pattern or varying rhythm. Template cadence in the final third: "She recalled… She adjusted… She inhaled… She folded… She stepped…" Metaphors occasionally muddle (aurora as "reminder that sorrow can be beautiful" is abstract rather than image-specific). The Text Artifact Screen triggers −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems; additionally, the figurative load in peak beats (barometer reading, final deck scene) obscures concrete action. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood or concept without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe paraphrase loops: paragraphs 2–4 restate "drowsy alertness," "ghost shift," and "weight of truth" in synonym cycles without advancing knowledge or pressure. Template cadence dominates ("He descended…he let…he listened…he chose"), creating syntactic monotony. Figurative language ("steel ribs," "Morse code of fear," "frequency chart of guilt") appears in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causality. The orientation paragraph (1) and the closure paragraph (12) both bury action under metaphor, flattening propulsion when clarity is most needed.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity and sensory specificity are strong. However, pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "regenerative silence" recurs five times without reweighting; "untold seasons" and "crumbling peace" are echoed without new pressure. Template cadence dominates: "The keeper…," "He…," "The…" sentence openers across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("thoughts dissolve like ink," "silence births renewal") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for distributed artifacts; −0.3 additional for loops touching the closure paragraph ("crumbling peace" recurs in the final third). Baseline deduction totals −1.1, landing the score in mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but figurative density is high without taught pattern: "breath of the earth," "hands cradling the sky," "shadow pulsing like a living heart" cluster in adjacent beats, creating mild register drift into elevated diction. Paraphrase loops appear ("the notion of ordinary magic fascinated Liora, for she believed that the most profound wonders…" restates the keepsake's "ordinary magic" without adding pressure). Template cadence in the final third ("she taught children to hum…elders to tap…") and the repeated "cautious exuberance" refrain without escalation cost −0.6 cumulatively in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence pervades: runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" structures across ten consecutive sentences in the middle third (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "the displaced axis" is restated three times within four lines without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("flickers like dying embers," "like scorched leaves," "like a low tide") cluster without fresh vehicle logic (−0.4). Information density is low—many sentences do one job only, and several restate the historian's method without advancing situation. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("he records the moment… he adds the new entry"), disallowing 9+ globally and escalating penalty to −1.2 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from paraphrase loops (multiple sentences restating "open secret" concept), template cadence ("He realized… He set… He watched"), and elevated metaphor density without clarity gain ("mirror that reflected an open secret," "orchestrate a message," "transpose life into a new key," "encoded breaths," "quiet music"). Filter-verb stacks ("felt a surge," "seemed to breathe," "knew that") dull immediacy in peak beats. Synonym churn for "secret" and "code" cycles without added pressure. The final third piles mixed metaphors (island breathes, lighthouse's heart beats, gull's cry carries encoded message) that blur rather than sharpen. Information density is low; most sentences repeat thematic assertions rather than advancing situation or choice. Scaffold phrases ("the irony was," "thus," "in the hush that followed") mark seams.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "unraveling of stillness" recurs across multiple beats without added pressure; "decorated with silence" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence is visible in stacked "The [noun] [verb]" openers and participial chains. Figurative language is dense ("dripped like honey over stone," "spill like ink onto the air," "plunge down like a spear") but often mixed or strained, lowering clarity at peak beats. Stock metaphors (mirrors reflecting doubts, single color as heartbeat) replace concrete action. Information density is low; many lines restate atmosphere rather than advance situation. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("walked into the light" as cliché resolution), triggering Q7 cap and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is lyric and rhythmically controlled, with vivid imagery (phosphorescent memory, shards of light cascading, frozen surface as membrane). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy: the mirrored horizon is described three times in the opening paragraph with overlapping language, and "unheard symphonies" / "unseen melodies" / "conductor" recur without functional pressure shifts. Template cadence appears in runs like "She reached… She placed… She closed… She smiled," flattening propulsion. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels, and some metaphors strain coherence (horizon "whispered promises," hush "inverted sound," ice "sang"). Density is uneven, with scaffolding that could be cut to tighten closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.4)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: "darkening brightness," "periodically eternal," and "between the drop and the ripple" recur without cumulative force, reading as template phrases. Mixed metaphors ("inverted roots," "gravity defied the world below") violate logic. Paraphrase loops abound: "each door a decision," "each echo a lesson," "each fragment returning" span multiple sentences with synonym churn. Density is low—most sentences restate atmosphere rather than advance story. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.6)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. However, the piece suffers from synonym churn and paraphrase loops: "audibly muted, not because sound could not exist, but because every vibration was swallowed" restates the same idea; "mirrored hush" appears five times with minimal functional variation; "filament of hush" recurs as both noun and metaphor without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "The music was not heard but felt... The cavern's air shifted... The cavern, once a tomb..." Stock metaphors cluster ("frost," "sunrise," "ghostly drumheads"). These artifacts dull the closure image slightly. Baseline −0.8 in Q7 for loops and churn; no causality break, so penalty stays here.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "quiet courtyard at dusk" appears three times verbatim; "layered tranquility" recurs without added detail; and multiple sentences restate Elara's resolve with synonym churn ("nurture integrity," "anchor… hope," "chronicle the storms"). Template cadence runs through the final third ("She knew… yet… she could weave… promising that…"). Figurative density in non-peak beats ("sky bruised violet," "vines like whispered secrets," "sediment in a calm lake") blurs momentum. Apply −1.2 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for density without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive overwriting and template cadence: runs of "He [verb]" and "the [noun] [verb]" across most sentences (−0.6). Mixed and strained metaphors accumulate (rope as compass rose, time woven into rope, walls breathing, stars applauding) without coherent vehicle logic (−0.5). Paraphrase loops recur (discovering texture of time restated four times; impossible choices declared thrice without variation). Stock phrases ("terra-cotta grotto," "passionate subtlety," "ethically playful") function as ornament rather than propulsion. Information density is low—most sentences repeat atmosphere without advancing situation or knowledge. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph loops thematic claims), triggering −1.7 total and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "chronic hush" appears five times with near-synonym restatements ("silence was never absolute, only waiting to be unbound" / "unbinding the silence that had settled" / "the chronic hush was not a void but a space waiting to be filled"). Template cadence runs in paragraphs 10–12 with repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors appear without fresh angles ("tide seeking a hidden shore," "seed sprouting in ash"). Figurative density in closure beats ("infinite grace," "canvas of endless light") elevates register without embodied anchoring. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, metaphor muddle −0.4 = baseline ~4.9; artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 rule.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is polished with vivid figurative language ("walls humming with a low, resonant static that seemed to taste of old rain," "emotions as a gardener tends roses"). However, density issues and loops reduce momentum: "half truths" appears six times, "static" nine times, "petal" fourteen times, often in near-paraphrase constructions ("half truths of the grotto—half memory, half myth" / "half truths she sells"). Template cadence runs appear ("She [verb], [gerund phrase]" across multiple sentences in the middle third). Figurative language is frequent without pattern-teaching or payoff, and some metaphors muddle (static "mapping" currents, petal "dissolving" into ambient sentiment). These artifacts dull the closure beat's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "cautious exuberance" appears three times; "cycles of compassion" recurs in adjacent paragraphs; "silent contributors" is restated without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate sentence openings ("Mara felt," "Mara placed," "Mara recorded," "Mara left"). Stock metaphors ("starlight like lanterns," "mind swirling like sea breezes") and elevated abstractions ("conduit for love," "the flow of kindness") appear in peak beats without pattern-teaching. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.6, stock metaphor strings −0.4, total baseline −1.6. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph summary), so apply −1.7 and disallow 9+ globally, capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "webs of kinship" echoes four times, "luminescent ache" three times, "glimmering obsidian arbor" five times, often in identical syntactic slots. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("They moved… the reeds whispering… the arbor watched… Night fell… the rim glimmered"). Mixed metaphors appear: the arbor is a "midnight lighthouse" yet has "glass bark," and shadows "stitched the ground into webs." Figurative density saturates high-pressure beats without payoff. Stock phrases—"boldly sympathetic," "shared longing," "fragile, beautiful duty"—flatten momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("rewrite the language of belonging"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.1)
    Figurative overload pervades: "lattice of stone ribs," "mirrored ribbons," "pair of tiny constellations," "dreamscape stitched together by the city's own sighs"—mixing metaphors without coherent vehicle across adjacent sentences. Paraphrase loops cluster mid-piece: "the place where echoes are born" appears three times in five paragraphs, and "interrupted cadence" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens six sentences in succession during the arch/cavern sequence. Stock phrasing ("lifted her small skiff," "a soft chime rang like a half-remembered song") replaces concrete action with generic gesture. Zero loops or scaffold is required for 9+; this piece stacks multiple artifact types, disqualifying high-band entry and triggering the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "the orchard grew silent" / "the orchard, though silent, seemed to pulse"; "ambiguous loss that lingered" / "ambiguous sorrow"; "glass eyes" mentioned eight times with minimal functional variation. Template cadence dominates—"He [verb]… his [noun]… and he [verb]"—across at least six sentences, dulling propulsion. Mixed metaphors cluster: "cracks sang softly, each one a fraction of sorrow that resonated with the orchard's roots" conflates auditory, mathematical, and botanical vehicles incoherently. Filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he realized," "he sensed," "he imagined") in the bridge sequence further distance immediacy. Figurative density in nearly every line—"pale lanterns," "amber fog," "silver note," "heartbeat pulse," "night flower," "gentle rain"—without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers overwriting penalties. Stock phrases ("half-remembered song," "quiet promise," "ever-lasting wonder") recur without fresh specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy loop and scaffold debt: "sapphire hush" x4, "sense memory" x5, "flickering" x3, "kindly methodical" x2 within 800 words. Paraphrase loop in opening: "cool breath of dust and ink" / "aisles stretching like quiet arteries" restate atmosphere without added pressure. Template stems recur: "She knew that…" / "She realized that…" / "She felt…". Mixed metaphor: "aisles stretching like quiet arteries" (anatomical) clashes with "library breathed a sigh of relief" (personification of the building as lungs). Register drift into abstract elevation—"collective yearning," "language of light"—dilutes immediacy at closure. Artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering cumulative deduction of −1.7 in Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences: "The nursery…seemed to breathe in time with the world outside, sustaining transformation in every leaf and root" directly restates the prior theme summary without adding pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "He + verb" or "The + noun" constructions across the middle third. Elevated diction ("circuitously sincere," "metronome," "orchestrate their own healing") clashes with the grounded POV of a working nursery owner. Stock metaphor: "veins had reorganized like tiny rivers reshaping a landscape." The final paragraph's exposition ("a reminder that sustainable growth thrives…") is scaffolding that should have been cut. These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality, so penalty stays in Q7 per routing rules.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level clarity is adequate; no major loops or scaffold. However, figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "bruised sky," "thresh meaning," "grind raw grief into pigments," "haggard awe," "varnish" of mist. Several phrases land as stock constructions—"her boots slipping on algae," "inner fire," "trembling note of hope." The convergence beat stacks passive constructions and abstract terms ("coalescing," "trembling note," "conduits of memory") that blur the physical event. Rhythm varies but propulsion slows in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "overlapping shadows" recur five times without evolving meaning; "unseen forces" appear in nearly every beat as theme assertion. Template cadence runs flatten momentum ("She steps forward…She captures…She knows"). Figurative density is high but muddy ("bright darkness" yoked to "dark tunnels can shine" within two lines; "tear of luminescent amber" that "turns shadows into ribbons of light" mixes vehicles). Closure beat is drowned in abstraction ("unseen forces…can magnify the magic hidden in everyday breath"). Apply −1.4 for loops, template stems, and figurative muddle touching closure; disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clear and rhythmically controlled with purposeful sentence variety. Information density is moderate: many lines advance atmosphere and theme but not plot pressure. Loop check: the phrase "navigating absences" and variants recur without adding pressure; "reactively visionary" is labeled twice; "staggered intervals" appears twice with slight variation. Template cadence is present in the middle third: "He gathered them," "He understood that," "He learned to," "He answered" (runs of subject-verb stems). Minor synonym churn: "fragments," "shards," "pieces," "whisper" cycle without functional distinction. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. The final third accelerates slightly but remains contemplative rather than propulsive. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loop artifacts (Non-closure Accumulation Cap).

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "mysteries she had unraveled were merely a prelude" restates the opening promise to "dare beyond the maps"; "arrows pointing like skeletal fingers" and "arrows etched in the stone seemed to pulse" recycle the same image without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She knelt… She inhaled… She placed… She lifted…") across four consecutive beats, flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors cluster in high-pressure moments ("colossal eye," "skeletal fingers," "trembling certainty"), and filter verbs stack ("felt the vault's ancient echo," "felt the metal sizzle," "feeling the cracks align"). Figurative density is high (most sentences carry metaphor) without pattern-teaching or payoff, and the closure beat ("stepping into a world where art and analysis danced on cracked arrows") dissolves into abstraction. The artifact spread touches closure; apply −1.7 baseline and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dense figurative layering appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "sea breathed mist," "constellations that only the patient could read," "words themselves were infused with the ocean's breath." Mixed vehicles appear (the tower "inhaled," the tile "pulsed," numbers "swirled" then "glowed" then "settled"). Register drift into abstract poetic language ("courageously kind," "entangled memories," "unheard symphony") pervades and is not anchored in the POV's concrete moment. Paraphrase loops: "She realized…" then "She slipped…and she whispered a promise…" then "Lira finally felt…"—three successive restatements of the same resolution without added pressure. Template cadence: many long sentences open with "The" or "She" and stack clauses in parallel rhythm. Apply −1.4 cumulative for density, coherence, and loops; artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the 9+ disqualification and high-band cap at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries momentum with varied syntax and clear action sequencing, but pervasive figurative density ("magnetic eddies, as if the fragment itself were a heart," "colors shifting from sapphire to amber in a cascade of prismatic echoes") layers metaphor in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. Stock constructions ("eyes heavy with," "a lover's sigh," "silent witness") and paraphrase loops ("goodbye," "farewell," "parting" cycle without added pressure) dull line-level propulsion. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" stems across consecutive sentences. Deduct −0.8 for density and coherence issues in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.3)
    Sentence-level rhythm is controlled and varied, with purposeful longer constructions building atmosphere. However, pervasive overwriting dulls momentum: metaphor density in nearly every line ("whispering shadows," "midnight river," "veins of gold," "liquid light," "dense fog," "shore," "twin vessels") without pattern-teaching or escalation. Paraphrase loops appear: "liquefies rigid thinking, turning stubborn doubts into fluid possibilities" echoes "liquefying her own rigid doubts and turning them into a fluid resolve." Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt," "watched," "understood") and abstract nominalizations replace concrete action ("breach of perception," "shared willingness to dissolve"). The closure beat is particularly affected—"equations glowed, and…walls dissolved" summarizes rather than enacts. Apply −1.0 for density and coherence issues touching closure, plus −0.3 for paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.7)
    Persistent paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent lines: "refract" appears in nearly every paragraph with minimal variation in function; "invented histories," "textures," "hum," and "battered notepad" are restated rather than advanced. Template cadence runs: "He would [verb]" structures repeat without taught pattern. Figurative density in most sentences ("bruised violet," "whispered verses," "inkstroke on a living page," "prism that refracted past and future") without escalation or payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: light cannot be "refracted" by charting a hum (sound ≠ light path). These artifacts dull momentum and obscure causality, pushing the score into the 4–5 band and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Each snippet layered onto the next, creating a palimpsest… that filters reality differently" repeats the layering/filtering claim across three adjacent sentences without new information. Figurative density clusters in low-pressure exposition ("rusted bones," "museum of vanished moments," "cold filament") rather than peak beats. Runs of "I [verb]" stems and synonym churn ("fragments," "whispers," "snippets," "voices") create mechanical rhythm. The final paragraph stacks three declarative summary statements that restate rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "reimagines past conversations" / "hearing his voice reimagined"; "resonant hums" appears five times without variation; "painted seashell" is repeated verbatim across beats. Template cadence in the middle third: "She placed... She lifted... She read... She smiled... She tucked." Stock metaphors cluster without payoff: "colors shifting like sunrise on a stormy sea," "needle trembling like a laugh caught in a storm." Figurative density in most sentences of high-pressure beats without coherent vehicle (−0.9). Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "reorganize the community" / "reorganization of stalls" / "reorganize the layout" / "reorganize again"; "hopeful desperation" appears three times with identical phrasing. Template cadence: "She discovered… She gathered… She sent…" structures multiple beats identically. The final third stacks these artifacts ("The council, seeing… Mira breathed out… The foundation stone chip… Children played… She watched…"), flattening propulsion. Figurative language is vivid ("floating circus," "kaleidoscope of music") but mixed ("phoenix looping around the foundation stone chip" conflates image and object incoherently). Information density is high in the graffiti-decoding passage but diluted by summary in the ending's recap mode.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "dawning hush" recurs without new pressure (lines 7, 15, 25, 29), and "outlast/outlasting" appears three times in similar constructions. Template cadence emerges in the second half: "He [verb], the [noun]" runs across multiple sentences (lines 18–22). Figurative density ("ghost of the nightwatch," "lighthouse," "shawl," "heartbeat of the universe") stacks without pattern-teaching or causal payoff. Stock metaphors ("blue marble," "breath of the world") dull specificity. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence combined in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied rhythm, but several lines loop conceptually: "magnetic calm" appears three times without reweighting; "the depot's mist" and "the hummingbird" recur as stems without added pressure. The phrase "turned ordinary illumination into a precise measuring tool" summarizes what has been shown. Some metaphoric reach ("promise of journeys," "bridge between broken things") elevates register without grounding in action. No major artifacts touch closure, but density and propulsion remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("compass," "herald," "veins," "portal," "mirror-like hush," "ice sang"), creating lyric texture but also register drift in peak beats where concreteness would sharpen pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "worrying tranquility" is restated as "calm that bordered on dread," and "the ice sang, and the world listened" echoes prior atmospheric declarations. Template cadence in the middle third (she took, she slipped, she traced, she aligned, she pressed) flattens momentum. Information density is adequate, but scaffold and synonym churn accumulate. Apply −0.8 for loops and cadence plus −0.3 for figurative muddle in pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.8)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and template cadence runs pervade the text: "his reputation rode on," "a dark instrument said to vibrate," "the town, now a ghost town revival in the making" all restate the same concept; "each step the tuner imagined…set a rhythm," "each imagined footfall," "steady beat beneath his boots" cycle without added information. Figurative language ("silent bell," "lattice of silver," "dust on a drum") is dense but often mixed or strained, and nearly every sentence opens with a similar stem or elevated diction that flattens rhythm. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to pulse," "felt the balance") and stock metaphors ("quiet yet undeniable") reduce immediacy. These artifacts cluster throughout, including the final third, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 rules.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "gathered hush" appears eight times, "touches memories" / "touch memories" / "touching memories" cycles four times, "crystal perfume vial" is repeated eleven times (often in full), "unsnarl" appears five times in similar constructions. Template cadence: "The walls were carved… seemed to touches memories" / "seemed to reach out and touch memories" / "touching memories of every diver." Register drift into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral," "lonesome splendor") clashes with the HUD and beacon framing. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching. Artifacts touch closure: the final paragraph restates "gathered hush," "lonesome splendor," and "crystal perfume vial" in a summary loop. Applying −1.7 in Q7 for artifact spread touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "chasing hush" / "promise of peace" / "mythic quiet" restate the same idea without added pressure; "hover" appears five times without causal variation; "copperlight repose" bookends without reweighting. Template cadence runs: "He stepped… He followed… He reached… He lifted… He stepped…" across consecutive paragraphs. Figurative density ("lattice… seemed to sustain impossibilities, bending light and shadow") appears in most lines without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causality and dulling the closure image. Mixed metaphors: the lattice "resonated" yet also "clung to his skin like salvation."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe overwriting: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without information. Paraphrase loops abound—"mournful elation" appears three times, "resonant awakening(s)" four times, "lovingly venomous" twice, all without reweighting. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive beats. Mixed metaphors: vines "sing," the bead "sings," branches "sang"—sound logic collapses. Stock phrases: "whisper of ash," "liquid amber," "roses and rust." Clarity suffers under the ornamental load; no propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean but marred by paraphrase loops and template cadence. Adjacent sentences restate the same content: "threading luminous yarn" / "Each nighttime wander stitched a filament of light"; "guide lost souls toward peace" / "their steps guided by unseen threads." Stock metaphors ("orchid solace," "gentle affirmation," "tapestry of stone and light") recur without fresh inflection. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("tide pools empty," "orchid veins in frost," "luminous canopy") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without propulsion. Sentence openings repeat ("The weaver," "She," "Each," "The labyrinth") across runs of three or more lines. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphor strings −0.3) totals −1.1; artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping this category at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs across the text: "interrupted journeys" appears six times, "purposeful wandering" / "warmly curious" / "cautious enchantment" recur as fixed phrases without variation. Sentence stems repeat ("She carried… She walked… She felt… She promised…" clustering in the final third). Stock metaphors—"pale rivers of memory," "glowing tapestry," "stitching together fragmented faiths"—stack without fresh vehicle. Information density is moderate; several lines restate atmosphere without advancing action. Clarity remains intact, but momentum drags under the weight of synonym churn and scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "surface mail…reimagined as a ceremonial conduit" is restated as "not just a transport of paper, but a transmission of marginal thoughts"; "margins held the most luminous stories" echoes "meaning in the margins" and "whispered margins of humanity." Template stems recur: "She [verb], [object]" across multiple lines. Figurative language stacks without coherence—"pulse of encoded hope," "lattice of light," "lullaby of pixelated seas"—and several metaphors mix vehicles (clipboard "glowing" and "projecting," streets "speaking in secret alphabets"). The final third intensifies these artifacts, triggering disallowance of 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from repeated scaffold patterns: "She was," "She placed," "She adjusted," "She finished," "She returned" across multiple beats (−0.5). Figurative language clusters densely without pattern-teaching or payoff—"bruised with dying stars," "stitching constellations into silk," "the echoed silence," "humming with the promise of change"—creating overwriting that obscures rather than propels (−0.6). Several adjacent sentences restate the same content in synonym loops: "the flame flickered in a pattern" followed by "she interpreted that as a code"; "she whispered to the flame" followed by "the candle obliged" (−0.3 for paraphrase loops). Information density is low; many lines describe atmosphere without advancing choice or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose carries vivid imagery but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple beats recycle the structure: "She placed the shard... the moonlight struck... condensation formed." Metaphors stack without propulsion ("thin veil," "liquid glass," "soft hands") and some contradict (spirits "catch syllables" and "weave" them into soil—how?). Stock phrases recur: "fierce tenderness" appears six times, "unsent letters" eight, flattening rhythm. Figurative density in the final third slows momentum rather than accelerating closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or elevated diction ("twilight mist deepening into a dream-like veil," "porous lattice," "gentle tide"). Template cadence in the second half: "She [verb], [object]" structure repeats across six sentences. Paraphrase loop: "The brain coral fragment vibrated faintly, as if acknowledging the shared anxieties now bound within its porous lattice, ready to grow stronger" restates the coral's symbolic role already established. Filter-verb stack ("She whispered back... her voice a gentle tide, promising that...") in peak beat. Figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.6; template cadence −0.5; loop −0.2; artifacts touch closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and adding −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft is functional but burdened by paraphrase loops and template cadence. Adjacent sentences restate the same idea: "The orchard district, once lost in centuries of thick fog, now hummed with a quiet, luminous optimism" immediately follows the fog thinning and trees trembling. Repeated stems ("She smiled," "She stepped back," "She turned away," "She walked toward") create drumbeat rhythm without variation. Figurative language ("pensive mirth," "fold of a daydream," "exposed film") appears in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Stock phrases ("her heart alight," "beat involvement") and abstract high-level descriptors reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is overwritten with stacked metaphors and repetitive phrasing. "Nested awakenings" appears five times; "reflected sound" or variants appear eight times, creating a synonym loop that dulls momentum. Mixed metaphors abound: sound waves as "ribbons," auroras that "paint," reflections that "layer." Sentence stems repeat mechanically: "The garden… The hobo nickel… The tone… She felt… She answered…" Template cadence in peak beats ("Each tap bewitches… each one containing… each more vivid") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she saw," "she understood") flatten immediacy. Register drifts into abstract lexicon ("nested awakening," "metronome that measured") inconsistent with a mural restorer's on-the-job perception. Paraphrase loops in adjacent lines (e.g., paragraphs 10–11 restate the garden's pulse syncing with Lena's heartbeat) reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.1)
    High metaphor density without pattern-teaching or payoff ("metronome that reminded the hidden listeners of the rhythm of revolt," "kaleidoscope of fragrant, humming possibilities") obscures causality and dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: lines 9–10 restate the seed's chant spiraling and converging without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third ("They whispered back… he welcomed it… they cultivated… the club blossomed…") with identical stems across four sentences. Filter-verb stacks and synonym churn ("warp," "converging chaos," "stitched," "reweights") reduce clarity. Applying artifact penalties: −0.6 baseline, escalated to −1.0 for spread across multiple beats including closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence runs pervade: "His method was simple yet uncanny," "Each note dripped," "He imagined each star as a wound he could mend, each nebula as a scar he could turn into a petal." Paraphrase loops recur—"centuries slipped by unnoticed" after "centuries of longing"—and figurative density in most sentences ("sugar in brine," "slow-growing coral," "vine seeking sun") blurs rather than propels. The patterned artifacts and synonym churn in peak beats ("whispers of distant suns," "scattering starlight") trigger baseline deductions; final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high bands at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "preserve the sound of forgotten names" / "recorded the resonance" / "reclaimed names" / "echo of the long-forgotten song" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She moved… She was… She arranged… She listened… She recorded… She knew"). Stock metaphors—"shy star," "violet sorrow," "translucent organ"—accumulate without coherent vehicle logic. The final third restates the opening ritual across three sentences, dulling the closure beat. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts (paraphrase loops, template stems, stock metaphor strings) and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "silence that had settled…was a breach" / "broken trust" restates the same idea across adjacent lines; "promise" recurs as both noun and verb without added pressure. Template stems ("She [verb], and the [object] [verb]") create rhythmic monotony. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (ink "sang," knot "unwound," droplets "formed a symphony") blurs rather than sharpens causality, triggering overwriting penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("whispered ancient applause," "singing a low hymn," "insects caught in a sunlit breeze") without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff, creating density without propulsion (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear: "tremble" variants recur six times without reweighting meaning. Template cadence in the second half: "She [verb]… The [noun] seemed to [verb]…" runs across multiple beats (−0.5). Mixed metaphors: the chain "sings a hymn" yet has "metal teeth"; adhesive "retained the imprint" that then "rearranged into binary pulses" without causal linkage. Register drifts into abstraction ("living algorithm," "ongoing encrypted compassion") that clashes with the tactile workshop voice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "Each tiny vortex became a paper trail" / "Each turn reminded Lila of a song" / "Each sunrise saw her adding new curves." Template cadence appears in "She believed… She knew… She realized… She felt…" stems. Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "bloom," "wither," "echo," "pulse," "glow" recur decoratively. The closure image—"the map she had drawn glows faintly on the attic wall"—is told rather than shown, and the final sentence summarizes theme ("balance and memory can coexist") instead of letting action land.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.9)
    Figurative density overwhelms clarity in nearly every paragraph: "featherly determined," "fractured hush," "necessary distances," "sacred pause," "quiet fire," "living diagram," "butterfly's ripple." Paraphrase loops abound ("each step a prayer," "each step measured," "each threshold whisper"). Template cadence runs of "He [verb]" constructions and repeated "each" openings flatten rhythm. The final paragraph summarizes the entire premise ("the true distance one must travel") instead of trusting image. Artifacts pervade the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn around "belonging," "rhythm," "luminous respite," and "soft" constructions that recur without adding pressure or new detail. Template cadence appears in several beats: "She placed...She whispered...She understood." Mixed metaphors mar clarity: "steps softly ingenious" applies an intellectual trait to footfalls without coherent vehicle. Stock phrasing ("constellation," "rhythm," "pulse") appears in most sentences of high-meaning beats without pattern-taught payoff. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.4, density without propulsion −0.5, capping at 4.9.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "The cave's interior pulsed" / "The mosaic pulsed"; "before memory fades" recurs twice; "cheerful gloom" appears four times without reweighting. Figurative language crowds nearly every sentence ("sea-foam recollectionist," "weep and smile at the same time," "transliterates emotions into faint, humming colors") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without propulsion. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("She felt," "She recognized," "She realized"). The opening and closing lines frame voice, but mid-story beats loop conceptually (seeds → colors → missing pieces) without advancing knowledge or tightening stakes. Stock metaphor strings ("stardust," "lullaby of hope," "rose-colored sigh") reduce specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative density is high and often mixed: "conduit for orchestrated serendipity," "fireflies over the arcade's neon ribbons," "gulls" for musical notes, "inked clouds," "silent witnesses." In the closure paragraph, stacked metaphors ("echo," "faint imprint," "bishop's crown") blur concrete action. Paraphrase loops appear: "He believed that magic could happen by ordering randomness, a paradox he whispered…" is restated by "He felt the moment collapse into a perfect fragment…" and the final "he slipped the bishop back…already planning the next sequence that would happen by ordering randomness again." Template cadence runs: "He lifted… He placed… He whispered… He lifted… He drew… He felt… He bowed… He slipped…" across nine consecutive moves. These patterns dull immediacy and trigger **−1.0** cumulative penalty in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb and artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("obsidian grace," "tide rose in rhythm with her arms"), but the piece carries synonym loops and paraphrase redundancy: "exile" appears nine times across adjacent paragraphs, often restating the same concept without added pressure ("elective exile," "voluntarily imposed distance," "exile within her dissolve"). Template cadence runs ("She would fledge... She claimed... She found... She traced...") dominate the middle, and the final third summarizes rather than dramatizes. Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed ("spilled ink" moonlight, "obsidian grace" applied to both speck and tapestry). Apply −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template stems; no closure-scene artifact, so non-closure cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "read between lines" recurs five times with minimal variation; "clear complexity," "noctilucent," "prism," "rings," "ripples," and "stone" cycle without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [abstract noun]" structures repeat across paragraphs. Elevated diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "ledger of deeds") clashes with the POV's grounded task (harbor glazier). Figurative density (prism, shards, galaxy, scripture, wheel, crowns, tapestry, talisman, eye) appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring rather than sharpening the image. Stock metaphors ("whispered," "breathe," "patient eye") flatten specificity. Baseline −1.4 for loops, template cadence, and register drift; additional −0.3 for figurative muddle in the final third. Artifacts pervade the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "hard softness" appears four times, "cracked/fractured" recurs in adjacent sentences without new information, and template cadence dominates ("She set...She whispered...She lifted...She realized"). Figurative language is dense but often mixed or opaque ("the moon's sigh," "stitching wounds with silence," "hard softness") without coherent vehicle logic, and elevated diction ("enlighten," "pact of innocence," "universal language") clashes with the stated firefighter POV. The final third stacks these artifacts at closure beats (box pulsing, light as rain, cracked light as beacon), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Strategic telling is absent; every beat is ornamented equally, flattening momentum and leaving no room for propulsive compression.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dense figurative layering in nearly every sentence ("sea-foam draped stone columns," "kaleidoscope of potential," "living ledger") blurs momentum and creates texture-for-texture's-sake rather than propulsion (deduction ~−0.6 for density without pattern payoff). Paraphrase loops appear: "required more than a single ascent; it required a chorus" and "demanded trial balloons…a chorus of daring experiments" restate the same idea. Template cadence runs: multiple sentences open with participial phrases across the first third. Pronoun reference for "they" (council vs. artisans) briefly wobbles mid-passage. Line-level clarity suffers under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies and sensory anchors are vivid. Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "She discovered that… Each new dream added… Word spread, and scholars began…" creates a summary-chain that flattens propulsion. Paraphrase loops: "walls dream" / "walls… carry stories" / "walls, like people" recycle core metaphor without added pressure. The closure beat remains clear, so line-debt is capped at −0.6. No major scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "borrowed heartbeat" appears seven times without functional variation; "dusky harmony" and "perceptively calm" are repeated mechanically. Template cadence runs: "He [verb]," "The [noun]" sentence openers cluster without taught pattern. Mixed metaphors: "borrowed heartbeat" shifts referent from droplets to brush to world pulse incoherently (−0.8). Stock phrases ("cascade of light," "tapestry of sound") replace concrete action. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering disallow-9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "sky that spun lazily," "flawed beauty," "operatively gentle," "silver hush of distant moons," "dew falling." Mixed metaphors and register drift cluster in peak beats ("the price of redemption had been taken"; "the operatively gentle rhythm of her heartbeat echo the celestial choreography"). Paraphrase loops are evident: paragraph openings recycle "Lira [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was a flawed beauty," "seemed to listen," "feeling its cool grain") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Information density is moderate; many sentences serve atmosphere over advancement, triggering momentum drag and artifact deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "sky bruised," "thin sheet of glass," "ghostly chorus," "broken glass that somehow felt whole" stack without coherent vehicle logic (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear ("the salt flat caught the vibration, sending it spiraling upward" / "the echo rippled across the emptiness") and template cadence runs in the opening half ("He had engineered," "He cradled," "He had learned," "He stepped") (−0.5). The final third remains artifact-heavy, disqualifying 9+ globally. Several sentences restate the same content: the map/cracks converge on the basin in adjacent lines without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence layers figurative language ("silver thread," "crystal chorus," "tapestry," "alchemy of sound") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that obscures rather than propels. Template cadence runs through repeated "She [verb]" openers and "The [noun]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear ("a song that dulled ambition and smoothed dissent" / "lullaby of conformity humming through the city"). Stock metaphors ("threads of magic," "harvest of echoes") are not transformed through specific action. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn"), triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy overwriting and pattern artifacts pervade. Metaphor density is high without pattern-teaching: "rusted cathedral," "quiet comet," "meteor hush," "ribbons of starlight" cluster in adjacent lines, often mixed or contradictory. Paraphrase loops abound: "half-lit epiphanies" appears four times; "uncommonly serene" twice; "meteor hush" three times; "campfire story stick" seven times with synonym churn ("ember-kissed tip," "beacon," "lantern"). Template cadence: runs of "She [verb]" sentence openers across the middle third. Register drift into elevated abstraction ("conscience unspooling," "ethical wonder") clashes with the concrete dome setting. No loops in the closure beat, but artifacts touch it ("soft, half-lit chorus of truth").

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.9)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening and closing paragraphs stacks figurative language ("orange whispers," "breath that lingered," "fingers that embraced," "knot of light") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops are frequent ("blushing stillness" appears five times; "interrupted cadence" three times without reweighting). Template cadence: "She [verb], [state]" runs across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("soft incense," "quiet hymn," "dewy poetry") cluster in high-pressure moments. Mixed vehicle: "transiently rooted" contradicts itself. Register drift into abstract diction ("esoteric realist," "conceptual Repricing") clashes with concrete action. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("blushing curve that mirrored the stillness"), triggering the −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("slithered like a silver serpent," "thawing fire," "delicate veins that glimmered like sunrise"), synonym churn ("whisper of a name…shouted in celebration"), and paraphrase loops (the final two paragraphs restate the sanctum-as-library conceit). Template cadence appears in the traveler sequence ("He knelt…he placed…the rope sang"). Filter verbs ("felt," "feeling") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The closing line—"learned to let the past melt into the present"—is a thematic summary rather than a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is moderate, but the piece carries multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences: "She believed that by interpreting dreams… she could transcend ordinary perception" immediately followed by "Through interpreted dreams, she saw a luminous trail"; "the moment stretch" / "perceiving the moment as a nexus"; "the decaying directive" appears in a cluster without functional variation. Stock metaphors ("ripples on a pond," "vines stretched outward") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt the moment stretch," "she felt herself transcend," "she understood") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy and trigger cumulative artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the covenant's true shape" / "uncloak the covenant" / "the covenant began to uncloak itself" / "the uncloak‑ed covenant"; "dusky" appears five times without functional variation. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "He sensed… He set out… He worked… He placed…" Figurative language is dense but often mixed: "curiosity glowed like distant fire" (thermal metaphor), "sketching… each line a bridge" (structural metaphor), "the palace walls seemed to inhale the dusk" (animate metaphor) within adjacent sentences without coherent vehicle. "Empirically ironic" is repeated as a stock phrase without concrete illustration. Information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere or theme rather than advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "scheming pacifist" / "non-violent subterfuge," "shifting grace" used five times without reweighting, "cellular memory" repeated as decoration. Template cadence runs ("She recalled... she sensed... she plotted...") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to recognize," "felt the weight") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors ("gentle twist of hidden gears," "thin veil of mist") and therapy-speak ("rewrite emotional pathways") cluster in peak beats, triggering −1.0 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally. The final paragraph summarizes rather than advancing image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.2)
    High figurative density pervades without pattern-teaching or payoff: "glass-mountain tone of silence," "fog curl into his lungs," "needles aligning with the captured light as if a compass for hope," "veins of silver," "tiny mirror" leaves. Many adjacent sentences restate the same event in elevated synonyms (e.g., "the sextant's broken arm seemed to straighten" followed by "the fog…sealing the cracks with vapor"). Template cadence runs appear: "He set…Then he placed…He began…With each cycle…" Loops and scaffold trigger cumulative penalties. Stock metaphors ("boundaries are merely shadows," "portal that hummed") and elevated diction ("coiling like ivy," "forged in fog") cluster in peak beats, reducing clarity and propulsion. Total deductions exceed −1.4 and the artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "ancient quartz lenses" / "fractured quartz" / "cracked quartz lenses" / "quartz's inner light"; "deciduous vows" appears four times with minimal variation; "accidental wisdom" bookends without reweighting. Template cadence runs in the final third ("She placed… laid… whispered," "gathered… began," "lifted… felt"). Stock metaphors ("spark that refused to dim," "bruised with storm clouds," "quiet hymn of hope") cluster in closure beats. Cumulative line-level debt: paraphrase −0.2, template −0.5, stock metaphor in closure −0.4, total deduction ~−1.1, plus artifacts touch the final paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that obscures rather than propels ("pond of starlight," "living map of ideas," "luminous pollen"). Paraphrase loops appear: "nonlinear inheritance" is restated three times in different metaphors without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "He discovered… He inquired… He realized… He understood… He turned" across six paragraphs. Register drifts into academic/philosophical phrasing ("paradoxical family tree of thoughts," "cognitive network") that clashes with embodied action. Applying artifact penalties (−0.6 density, −0.4 template, −0.3 register drift) totaling −1.3, plus clarity loss at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "the lock clicked, and the door opened"; "the botanical diary, its pages stitched...each entry noting"; "each discovered void sang a low chord, a note the unheard symphony." Figurative density ("stone cathedral," "silent music," "surgeon exposing a hidden artery") appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting that flattens propulsion. Synonym churn ("resonated," "unfurled," "reweighted") and scaffolding stems ("she renegotiated," "she traced," "she stepped") stack without variance. The phrase "a note the unheard symphony" is a syntactic slip. Information density is low; many lines restate prior content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.4)
    Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6): "ghostly whispers," "captured sunrise," "living canvas," "lighthouse born of ink," "rusted chains of light." Mixed metaphors abound—ink flows "backward" yet acts as water, threads are "fragile rope of meaning" then "a net." Paraphrase loops: "The ship's decks were littered…She moved blissfully aberrant" restates mood without advancing causality. Template cadence across multiple lines ("She cradled…She moved…She pressed…She dove…She assembled…She gathered…She lifted…She smiled") (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("watercolor bleeding," "storybook") and therapy-speak ("unkindled solace") in peak beats (−0.3). Total artifact load disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template stems weaken momentum: "Mara knew that to unlock the door's paradox, she must reconfigure the braids" → "began to reweave the braids, following the twin-spiral pattern" repeats intent without added pressure. Figurative density at high-pressure beats—"door dissolved into a ripple of air," "cool breath of absence," "dust on ancient ledgers"—piles metaphor without coherent vehicle. Stock constructions: "she understood that," "she recalled," "she placed," "she recorded" create syntactic monotony. Scaffold phrases ("the fables whispered that," "a reminder that") flatten propulsion. No grammatical errors; line-level clarity holds, but information density sags under ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings repeat template structures: "He began… He approached… He placed… He whispered… He returned… He understood…" across the second half, creating monotonous cadence (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "gently luminous" recurs five times without functional variation, "bloom of hush" four times, "crack patterns in ice" three times as identical anchor phrases (−0.4). Figurative language ("living auroras," "sapphire light," "calm tide") clusters densely in the middle third without pattern-teaching or causal payoff (−0.3). The loops and template stems dull momentum in the retrieval and placement sequence, obscuring propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "The shard of hush vibrates, echoing… A thin ribbon of light unfurls… The lantern sputters, then steadies…" in consecutive sentences; "I keep… I step… I track…" in another cluster. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("remembers the night," "whispers that renewal is possible," "fire the hearts"). These artifacts dull the rekindling beat and the closure, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "sculpt identity from experience" / "shape identity from gathered experience" / "sculpt new identities"; "collective memory" / "shared pasts" / "shared remembrance" / "collective recollections" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear in the mid-section ("He recorded... He imagined... He traced..."). Stock metaphors ("pressing against," "stitched together," "dance like ancient verses") accumulate without earned specificity. Register drifts into thesis-speak ("the act of conjecture itself was a bridge") that clashes with the POV's ostensible immersion in sensory observation. Line-level clarity is adequate but information density is low—many sentences restate the same conceptual claim.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "chants while walking" appears five times with synonym variants ("low chants," "final chant," "chanting softly"); "blooming fortress" repeats four times with near-identical phrasing; "filter" and "mosaic" recur without added pressure. Template cadence: "He [verb]" stems run across multiple sentences in the middle third. Figurative density is high—"velvet blank," "humming gallery," "moving tiles," "cascade of colored ribbons"—without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to choice. Baseline −0.8 for loops and stems; −0.4 for density in peak beats without payoff; total −1.2.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "pause," "thin breath," "held breath," and "veil" all describe the same concept within a few paragraphs; "texture of time" recurs five times without added meaning. Figurative density is high in non-crisis moments ("every ripple a clue, each shimmer a sentence"). Template cadence is mild but present ("She noted," "She recalled," "She realized," "She smiled"). Clarity remains intact, but propulsion stalls under decorative layering.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long breath gives way to shorter clauses at the trellis. Information density is high (every line advances world, character, or atmosphere), and sensory specificity avoids stock metaphors. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The legend among the underground dwellers said…" is restated by "the elder whispered"; "intangibly tangible" is explained immediately rather than shown. Figurative density ("molten gold," "silver thread," "spider's silk," "gilded hush") clusters without always clarifying image relationships, nudging toward purple at peak beats. No major scaffold or typos, but the cumulative ornamental weight slows closure momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high without pattern payoff: "sunrise caught in glass," "fractured lullabies," "ship of glass over thought" pile ornament without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops: "Each whisper was meant to teach silence" / "teach silence how to comfort" / "the silence was ready to teach." Template cadence: "She [verb]" openers recur across beats. Information density is low; many lines restate mood rather than advance situation. Rhythm does not modulate with urgency. Apply −0.8 for loops and figurative muddle in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or figurative language without breath ("boots echoing against mossy bark as holographic dew glimmered," "a cascade of pixelated rain, each drop a memory"). Template cadence appears in the opening third: "She X, feeling Y" structures repeat. Paraphrase loops cluster mid-story: "ascension" and "stairway" recur without added meaning. Closure beat summary—"her journey complete, yet the future stretched"—deflates rather than charges. Line-level density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-taught payoff at closure (−0.5 for density). Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "burned bridges carefully" recurs twice with no added pressure; "fading threshold" is restated in adjacent lines as "doorway whose outline blurred" and "threshold's edges shimmering like a heartbeat" (−0.4). Template cadence runs: "He burned bridges…He approached…He burned bridges…He left…He turned" across four consecutive paragraphs (−0.5). Mixed metaphors: "teach the suffocating darkness to breathe" personifies darkness as a student, then shifts to "coax life from the very air that tried to choke it," conflating air and darkness illogically (−0.4). Stock phrasing: "promise of renewal," "lesson settle," "loaded quiet." Information density is low; many lines restate the same abstract concept without advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "glitchy text messages" and "glitchy texts" recur without new detail; "quantum promise" is restated across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "The [noun] [verbed]" stems and stacked participial openers. Purple-prose clusters ("translucent violet curtain," "kaleidoscope that painted the farm in a shadowseam wonder," "amber night") blur rather than sharpen the closure image. The final third's exposition ("noting that the very act of volunteering had turned the abstract weight...") sacrifices scene momentum for summary. Grammar is clean, but information density is low—many sentences restate concepts rather than advancing situation or interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "eloquently silent" appears twice with no reweighting; "golden shadows" recurs without functional difference; "bridge of intuition" is restated across multiple lines. Template cadence runs appear in the middle section ("He realized that… He lifted… He turned…"). Stock metaphors ("ribbons of light," "tide of remembrance") and elevated diction ("muse," "conduit") inflate texture without advancing pressure. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content. The final paragraph loops thematic claims ("transforming silence into a new kind of eloquence") that echo the premise without new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is extreme and often mixed: "night... stretched like a canvas awaiting a painter's breath," "pages curled like wilted petals," "script unfurled like a living serpent... breathing fire that painted... constellations." Metaphors pile without clear propulsion or causal linkage (−0.6 for density and coherence issues). Paraphrase loops appear: "murmured allegiance" recurs five times, "shivering bliss" three times, "as reality shifts" / "reality shifts" three times, often restating mood without advancing knowledge (−0.4 for template cadence and loops). Information density is low; many sentences perform atmosphere work without moving situation or character. The closure beat ("whispered once more, a final murmured allegiance... sealing the pact with a kiss of frost") is touched by these artifacts, escalating the deduction slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn flatten momentum: "histories that refuse to die" / "histories that never found a hearing"; "dust rose" / "dust settled back into patterns"; "button's weight" recurs four times without added meaning. Template cadence dominates high-pressure beats ("She lifted it… She set… She traced… She wrote… She placed"). Figurative language clusters without coherence ("veil of dust rose, unfurling like a silent flag"; "filament of dust a reminder"). Stock metaphors ("beacon," "bridge," "pulse of hope") replace concrete action. Apply Text-Artifact penalty: −1.4 in Q7 for loops, stems, and metaphor strings touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant paraphrase loops: "The story of that night would circulate in underground verses, each retelling revising the history of the oppressed" immediately echoes prior lines about revised histories without advancing pressure (−0.3). Template cadence: "She whispered… She slipped… She walked…" across multiple beats (−0.5). Stock metaphors pervade ("phantom fireflies," "cracks of complacent stone") without fresh vehicle logic. Figurative density in nearly every sentence ("silver veil," "scattered coins," "molten gold," "liquid memory") obscures rather than sharpens action, especially during the transmitter scene where clarity is paramount (−0.6). Information density is low—many sentences restate theme or describe without advancing situation. The cumulative artifact penalty approaches −1.4, and the final-third presence of loops disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "radiant grotto in mist," "prism atrium in mist," "quietly vivid," "vested hush," and "negative space" recur as ornamental phrases without functional variation, creating a template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear: "He played, not to announce, but to dissolve" restates "to hush a prophecy" without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: "prophecy spoken in code" vs. "hidden in the cadence of ancient drums"—code and cadence are contradictory vehicles. Register drifts into pseudo-philosophical abstraction ("negative space," "vested hush") that clashes with the saxophonist's embodied act. Apply −1.2 for density + coherence + template cadence, disallow 9+ globally, and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dense figurative language pervades without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("living parchment," "mossy delight," "soft prod of destiny") that blurs concrete action. Paraphrase loops appear: monuments "glimmer faintly" when dust settles, then later ignite; the transformation is both "steady rebirth" and "forever changed." Template cadence is visible in the and-then sequencing ("She traced… She filled… Returning to…"). Register drift into abstraction ("mossy delight of centuries-old bark," "soft prod of destiny") clashes with the task-oriented seed-sorting frame. Sentence openings vary, but information density is low—many lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high; spatial choreography tracks cleanly through tunnel, greenhouse, cavern, and fissure. The piece avoids major loops or scaffold but exhibits mild synonym churn around "uncertainty" and repeats the stem "She [verb]" across multiple adjacent beats in the middle third. A few figurative phrases stack without clear payoff ("swirl of hidden currents beneath the ashes" recurs without evolving pressure). The brazier scene delivers clarity and momentum, keeping the closure beat clean. Proofreading is solid; no grammatical breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is largely clean with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, several lines loop conceptually: the weight of names is introduced, then re-stated ("invisible mass," "measured heft"), and the redemption claim appears twice in nearly identical phrasing. Filter verbs ("feeling," "aware," "understood") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy during the closure beat. Figurative density is high ("mirror of storm-slick ripples," "sunrise caught in a river of steel") but some vehicles strain coherence (a sunrise "caught" in steel is spatially unclear). Deduction: −0.6 for loops and filter stacks in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "spectral confessions" recurs six times with minimal variation; "luminous ache" appears thrice in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]" stems in seven consecutive sentences mid-story). Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: "chorus of unseen voices" conflicts with "translucent sighs," and "sunrise glass" lacks coherent vehicle. Stock phrases ("modestly fearless," "bright pulse") replace concrete imagery. Information density is low—many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("luminous ache" in final third), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "ultraviolet" appears in nearly every paragraph, often in stock phrases ("ultraviolet fire," "ultraviolet canopy," "ultraviolet penance," "ultraviolet limbs"). Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "She braced" and "She reached" sentence openings. Mixed metaphor: the forest "breathes" and has "limbs" but also "retracts" them like mechanical appendages. Filter-verb stacks ("She felt," "She realized," "She recalled") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. The equation beat is told in summary rather than dramatized. Stock metaphors: "beacon," "scalpel," "roots." Artifacts touch the closure (final paragraph's explanatory summary), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "I work as a between‑worlds translator, a conduit who deciphers" restates its own function; "eternal instant captured" and "timeless instant I have created" recycle the same metaphor without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("rise like incense," "settle like stars," "glitter like a constellation") appear in most beats without coherent vehicle logic. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("elusively tangible balance of what is seen and unseen") disconnected from embodied action. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("your stories will never dim"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and information density is adequate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "cracks in the façade" is restated three times with minor variation (ticket counter, roof mouth, final recap); "mainspring barrel" is introduced twice (toolbox, then again in the concealed compartment) without clear escalation. Figurative language clusters in early paragraphs ("tired animal," "bruised clouds," "slow spiraling dance") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating mild overwriting. Template cadence ("She began engaging… She whispered… She followed…") flattens momentum in the middle third. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for figurative density without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.8)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: adjacent sentences restate the same content with synonym churn ("whisper," "rustling awakenings," "bottled whisper's hidden song" cycle without adding pressure; "compress eternity into a moment" appears verbatim four times). Mixed metaphors: frost "conduit," whisper "hums," pages "unfurl like wings," shards "sing"—vehicles violate each other's logic. Scaffold phrasing ("She traced… She pressed… She lifted… She placed") stacks across the climax. Final-paragraph thematic echo ("testimony that rustling awakenings can rewrite") is sermon rather than image. Accumulation triggers −1.4 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor or elevated diction ("baroque," "gilded," "burnished," "luminous veil," "cascade of silver rain") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("heart heavy with burnished sorrow, yet alight with the knowledge"; "loss and creation" recurs thrice). Template cadence in the final third ("She smiled," "She whispered," "She slipped") and synonym churn ("verses," "stories," "myths," "frescoes," "tapestry") dull momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("saw," "watched," "seemed") cluster in high-pressure beats. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "the covenant wilts near dishonesty" restated multiple times; "tinkersong wonder" appears thrice without reweighting. Template cadence runs cluster in the repair sequence ("He placed… whispering… He circled… gently aligning… humming"). Filter verbs stack without voice motivation. Figurative language ("rust behaved like a garden of iron vines," "luminous lattice") decorates rather than clarifies. Deduct −0.8 in Q7 for patterned artifacts; no 9+ allowed globally.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "vaulted opening revealed a subterranean lagoon beneath limestone cliffs, its surface a mirror of night. The water lay still, a black glass that swallowed the faint glow..." clusters metaphor without advancing causality. Paraphrase loops appear: "hinged awakenings" / "hinges of reality shifting"; "resonant hush" is invoked three times without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs: "She realized...She understood...She turned...She smiled...She walked." Stock metaphors ("petrified guardians," "liquid glass") and filter-verb stacks ("feeling the weight," "feeling the cool edge") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("quiet surrender," "endless wonder"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "weathered throat breathing wind," "arch becomes a metaphor," "turbine-hum reverie," "chorus of time." Mixed metaphors appear ("threads of glowing rope," "sea maps dissolve into myth") without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops recur: "reimagine" appears twice in adjacent beats with identical function; "layered meanings" is restated three times. Template cadence: "She decides… She lifts… She gathers… She returns." Line-level opacity in peak beats ("timewoven alliances echo," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") obscures agency and flattens momentum. Artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ globally and applying cumulative deductions here.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose features stacked modifiers, ornamental metaphors, and paraphrase loops that dull momentum. "Dawning hush," "umbral tenderness," and "amber light" recur as decorative motifs without shifting meaning; "quietly driven" and "restless need" are synonym variants of the same abstraction. Register drifts into corporate-academic phrasing ("the world's quiet pulse," "collective memory embedded in the postcards") that clashes with scene urgency. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She remembered… Now, the winter's last snow… Mara's curiosity led her…") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Filter-verb stacks in the cathedral beat ("felt the stone floor vibrate," "felt tears trace paths") and stock metaphors ("glowed with a quiet fire," "bridge woven through postcards") reduce clarity and propulsion. Multiple artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph moralizing), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence dominates: "The [noun] [verbed]" and "She [verbed], [gerund phrase]" structures repeat across the text. Paraphrase loops are frequent—"searing reverie" appears three times, "suppressed voices" twice, and the diary's encryption is restated in adjacent lines ("encrypted," "retrocognitively trapped," "demanded a code of compassion"). Key beats are summarized rather than dramatized: "She convened a final parley…promising to share" and "Mara broadcasted the decoded entries" tell outcomes without showing the acts. Figurative density is high but often mixed or inert: "heart burned with a searing reverie, a relentless heat that turned memory into flame" stacks fire metaphors without fresh vehicle. These artifacts pervade the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "deserted" appears four times, "ghost town" eight times, "paper lantern" / "lantern" nine times, "memory" / "recollection" / "recalled" thirteen times, often in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence dominates: "He rejected," "He conceived," "He imagined," "He let," "He watched." Stock metaphors pile up: "skeleton of boarded windows," "sealed its fate in amber," "streets lit up like constellations." Register drifts into corporate abstraction ("working memory," "blueprint," "method") without POV anchor. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to whisper," "began to pulse," "felt a quiet pride") dull immediacy in key beats. Apply −1.4 for artifact spread and disallow 9+ globally; final-third artifact presence caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is dense with figurative language and elevated diction throughout ("velvet disquiet," "tapestry of sorrow," "loop of prophecy and preservation"), creating a uniform lyric texture that does not modulate with scene pressure (−0.5 for overwriting density). Paraphrase loops appear: the prophecy's weight and Harel's mission are restated in adjacent lines without added information (−0.2). Template cadence is present in parallel structures ("whispered," "exhale," "humming") across multiple sentences without taught pattern (−0.4). Information density is low; many sentences ornament rather than advance. Artifacts touch the closure beat, so high-band entry is disallowed and 9+ globally capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting throughout (−0.6). Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "felt furiously tranquil, a storm of calm," "borrowed time…the way it stretches" restates across adjacent lines (−0.4). Template cadence ("She lifted…She recalled…She lowered…She opened…She knelt…She retrieved…She smiled") runs for seven sentences without variation (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("ice walls began to melt," "shards of time like crystal snowflakes") reduce clarity in peak beats. Information density is low; most sentences describe ceremonial action without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and largely free of loops or scaffold. A few ornamental constructions weaken propulsion: "the sanctuary above the clouds became a place where noise yielded to understanding" restates the premise rather than advancing it; "the wind sang a soft lullaby, carrying the story of the humble tester to ears yet untrained" adds poetic padding without new pressure. Information density is moderate—several sentences describe process without complication. No glaring artifacts, but figurative language occasionally slows momentum in a story already light on conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent sentences: "flourishing stillness" is restated in varied metaphors (emptiness/fertile ground, hush/well of silence) without new information (−0.4). Template cadence runs: "The janitor's purpose…" / "To achieve this, the janitor traced…" / "Each trajectory became…" / "The janitor, feeling…" stack identical subject-verb stems (−0.5). Figurative density in every beat ("threads pulled into glow," "air polished by invisible hands," "molten sunrise," "flower in night") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("cradle," "bridge between fragile and infinite") and elevated diction ("phosphorescent pulse," "primal elegance") clash with the utilitarian role of janitor. Sentence openings vary little, creating drumbeat rhythm. Combined artifacts touch closure beats, triggering the disallow-9+ cap.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence pervades: "The box…," "He…," "The ghosts…" cycle in predictable patterns across the piece. Paraphrase loops appear ("the weight of unspoken words" echoed in "mute eloquence," "silent conversation," "unspoken," "never spoken"). Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh particulars: "calm of a stone lake," "veil," "dust on his palms." Filter verbs stack in contemplative beats ("believed," "understood," "felt," "seemed"). These artifacts dull momentum and disallow 9+ globally. Deduction: −1.2 in Q7 for pervasive template cadence and loop density.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.1)
    Line-level clarity is adequate, but the prose suffers from repeated abstract metaphor strings in high-pressure beats ("texture of time passing itself," "shimmering time-threads," "tapestry she could walk through"). Sentence openings vary, but figurative density flattens momentum rather than propelling it. Minor scaffold appears: "seemed to," "as if," "a reminder that" recur without pattern-teaching. The final paragraph stacks multiple closure metaphors (sky stitched with sand, stars as moments, tapestry walk-through) that blur rather than sharpen the image. No major loops or grammar errors, but overwriting dilutes information density.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "The lagoon responded, its surface knitting... / The lagoon's surface brightened... / the lagoon glowed faintly" restates the same content across beats. Repeated stems: "His warmly attentive [heart/gaze/spirit]" (three times), "by harmonizing discord" (twice), "woven dawns" (five times without evolving). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicles: "like a gentle sigh," "like soft copper against rust," "like a solitary star." Figurative density in most sentences flattens momentum rather than propelling it. Information density is low; many lines rephrase the poet's ritual without advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies, figurative language is controlled, and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "gently systematic" recurs four times with minimal variation, "brazen calm" appears three times, and template cadence runs through the copper-wrapping sequence ("Each coil...a measured twist...a gently systematic ritual"). Stock phrasing ("testament to," "living library," "bridges the gap") clusters in the final third. These artifacts dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty (−0.6 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally).

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language ("silvered sentinel," "luminous skeptic," "melodic echo," "chemical fingerprint," "bronze quiet fire," "chemical chorus") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that slows momentum rather than advancing it. Template cadence runs through the final third: "The artificial pilgrimage had reached its apex… The tower, still rainwashed but now shining… In the bronze quiet that settled…" Paraphrase loops appear: "homecoming… not a place but a pattern of returning" restates the same idea. Filter verbs cluster: "seemed to echo," "felt within," "felt a surge," "felt the world exhale." Stock metaphors ("endless rain," "faint inner light") and therapy-speak ("belonging," "understanding") dull peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure passage, triggering the high artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is generally apt, but several loops and scaffolds appear: "narrow vastness" recurs four times without deepening meaning, and the final third paraphrases prior beats ("the garden breathing," "the garden's reclamation," "the garden's scent"). Template cadence runs emerge in the closing paragraphs ("He knew… yet…," "He turned… the seed pods now empty… the garden breathing…," "And as… the coachman smiled…"). Information density is moderate; many sentences restate the mission's success without new pressure. Orientation is clear, but propulsion slows in the final third as summary replaces scene.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("veins glinting like veins of copper," "letters trembling like fireflies in a storm"). Multiple mixed metaphors ("leaf's cold surface pulse," "choir of distant voices...streamed like tinted revelations") violate physical logic. Paraphrase loops are present ("translate distance into closeness" appears three times with minimal variation; "wild hush" recurs as filler). Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "knew") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Template cadence runs: "He [verb]...he [verb]" across multiple sentences without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "echoed silence" appears three times, "stretched" and "dilated" recur without new pressure, and "true north" is restated in five separate constructions. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "I [verb]," and the final third stacks filter verbs and abstract nouns ("pulse," "shimmer," "glow") without concrete propulsion. Figurative language is dense but mixed: "glass cradle," "river of light," "vacuum," and "blank map" compete without coherent vehicle. The closure beat is dulled by scaffold: "whispered a promise that I would continue to navigate…" Baseline −1.2 for loops and cadence artifacts; −0.3 for figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is rhythmically varied but overwritten at nearly every beat. Figurative density ("glittering monolith," "frozen teeth clawing," "clouds pulse like living ribbons," "soul expand like a sunrise") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, violating the Overwriting coherence check. Paraphrase loops abound: "amend a centuries-old betrayal" / "a silent amendment to the old curse"; "pocket sundial lid" is introduced, described, and repeated across six beats with synonym churn ("thin brass circle," "its soft chime," "humming a gentle tune"). Template cadence runs pervade: "He lifted... and placed... With a flick... he swapped... Each exchange felt..." Filter-verb stacks ("felt the cautious abandon," "felt his own soul expand") dull immediacy in peak beats. The ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the descent and market scene, further flattening momentum. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for pervasive artifacts and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.7)
    Line-level clarity is generally clean with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, the piece exhibits multiple text-artifact patterns: "benevolently ruthless" appears twice as descriptor without embodied cost; "interregnum" recurs three times in summary mode; "nomadic penumbra" is introduced, repeated, and looped across beats with synonym churn ("wandering shadow," "protective cloak," "reminder") but never clarified as concrete phenomenon. The phrase "luminous absence" functions as a stock metaphor string without precision. These artifacts accumulate across the text (−0.9 baseline in Q7) and dilute propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff: nearly every sentence layers metaphor ("silent cathedral," "pools of liquid metal," "seed forgotten memories," "coaxed into flame," "storm clouds," "shape of home," "night flowers," "stone ribs," "lungs of an ancient beast"). Mixed metaphors appear: the mountain's "stone ribs" both "expand like lungs" and emit a "hum." Register drift into abstract poetic diction throughout ("vibration thrumming through the marrow," "the texture of feather-light insight"). Paraphrase loops: "shape of home" recurs six times with synonym churn. Deductions for density overwriting (−0.6), mixed metaphor (−0.4), and loops (−0.4) = −1.4 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from heavy metaphorical density without pattern payoff: nearly every sentence in the labyrinth sequence layers figurative language (corridors "like a knight's L-shape," walls "breathe," threads "whisper"), creating cumulative opacity. Paraphrase loops appear: "woven hush" recurs six times with minimal variation; "frayed threads" echoes four times in close proximity. Template cadence: "He [verb]" stems dominate the middle third. Stock phrases ("the world held its breath," "time slipped forward like a pawn advancing one square") dull specificity. Information density is moderate—sentences advance atmosphere but rarely do double duty for character and plot simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied, but pervasive template cadence ("She [verb]… The [noun] [verb]…") and paraphrase loops dull momentum: "refract," "price," "pale spire," and "forged hush" recur without reweighting, often restating the same content across adjacent sentences. Figurative density is high ("wounded beast," "frozen finger," "shards of cold silver") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting in non-peak beats. Information density is low; many sentences describe rather than advance. No filter-verb stacks or register-drift errors, but the line-level artifacts (paraphrase loops, template stems) cluster throughout and touch the closure paragraph ("We are the echo" restates the core concept rather than dramatizing cost).

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff: "skeletal ship," "tapestry of hope," "bulwark of purpose," "furnace," "liquid light" cluster in adjacent lines, blurring focus (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "quilts memories together" is restated as "weaving a tapestry," "stitched a filament of light," and "quilting memories together" within three paragraphs (−0.3). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The alchemist" or "She" + past-tense verb across the middle third without variation (−0.4). Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (e.g., the charm's warmth + forgotten tides), but scaffold phrases like "between breaths held underwater" recur without added pressure. The final paragraph stacks closure gestures (smile, door close, reflected sunrise) that feel like checklist beats rather than propulsive image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "salty wind brushed," "cobblestones seemed to pulse," "tunnels twisted like the brushstrokes of a tempest," "canvas seemed to pulse." In peak discovery beats, metaphor stacks without variation (−0.5). Paraphrase loops: "promised myself… to find a place" echoed by "promise guided my steps" and "promise solidified" create synonym churn (−0.4). Sentence openings vary, but information density is diluted by ornamental phrasing. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −0.9 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "pulse with unseen light," "vibrations of intent," "trembling like a thin string," "quiet chord," "luminous thread," "screaming tenderness," "lover's arms," "bridges that spanned continents." Mixed metaphor: "tenderness shouted louder when it was felt in the softest of breaths" contradicts the shout/whisper binary the piece establishes. Template cadence runs: "She would beckon... She whispered... She placed... She lifted... She realized... She turned... She placed..." Paraphrase loops: paragraph 8–9 restate the vibration/hum/pulse concept without advancing pressure. Overwriting penalty (−0.7) and template-cadence penalty (−0.6) apply; artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "skeletal ribs," "eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps," "invisible rivers across the sky." In peak beats (the engine's completion, the ships' arrival), metaphor stacks without propulsion—"Each breath she drew was raw solace, a reminder that even broken machines and fractured maps could still point toward something worth returning to" paraphrases the theme rather than advancing action. Template cadence appears: "Each call painted... Each breath she drew... each line... each ring." Apply −0.8 for stacked figurative language and paraphrase loops in closure beats. No generation artifacts or grammar errors, but information density is low—many sentences restate rather than add.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("cathedral of fruit," "certainty of a mushroom's spore," "leaf-dust like confetti") without pattern-teaching or causal payoff, cluttering peak beats. Template cadence appears: "I saw… I placed… I spoke…" across three sentences in the climax. Mixed metaphor: the eye "glittered like a frozen tear" yet later "glimmered under muted light" without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loop: "truthfulness meant every claim I uttered slipped out" restates "involuntary truthfulness" without added pressure. Artifact penalties (−0.8 total) and elevated diction in crisis beats lower clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("bruised lavender," "opal surface reflected… isolation"), but synonym churn and template cadence appear: "softly persistent" (×3), "borrowed memory/memories" (×4), "gaps" (×6). Paraphrase loops: "The flower seemed softly persistent…" echoed by "…the flower's softly persistent spirit" and "a softly persistent echo." Adjacent sentences in the middle third repeat the structure "He [verb], [gerund clause]…" across multiple beats. These artifacts dull immediacy and information density. Apply baseline −0.8 for loops and template cadence, preventing 9+ eligibility globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops recur: "lingering promise" appears in three separate beats without shifting meaning, and "each one a reminder" / "each entry annotated" cycle through the coda. Template cadence is visible in the final third: "He now greets… knowing that the doorway… waiting for…" stacks three consecutive forward-looking summary clauses. Figurative density is high throughout ("inked by starlight," "tighten around his chest like a rope," "echo the quiet certainty") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, triggering overwriting guidance. Information density is moderate; scaffold sentences summarize state ("he felt a surge of purpose," "he understood") rather than advancing through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "bleeding starlight" appears four times with no reweighting; "ember grotto on the ridge" is repeated verbatim three times as a label rather than evolving object. Template cadence runs in the mid-section: "She stepped forward… She reached out… She approached… She whispered…" (−0.6). Figurative language is dense without payoff—"walls exhaled," "ceiling opened like a wound," "lacy menace"—mixed metaphors that blur rather than sharpen (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("dissolved like mist," "bleeding starlight") in peak beats reduce immediacy (−0.3). Filter-verb stacks appear ("felt the pull," "felt the ground pulse," "felt the weight") without voice motivation. Total artifact penalty: −1.3 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "revalue" appears six times, "returning differently" thrice, "density of presence" twice, all without on-page pressure shift. Template cadence runs: "The alchemist felt... / He watched... / They agreed... / And with that, they..." across the final third. Stock metaphors cluster: "hearts alight," "light would speak louder than any argument," "each step a quiet affirmation." Register drifts into prompt-speak ("scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity") mid-scene without voice anchor. Patterned-artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and some images are vivid ("wind carve new stories into my skin"), but template stems recur frequently across adjacent lines ("I sit," "I watch," "I feel," "I close," "I glance," "I write," "I stand") creating a drumbeat cadence that flattens propulsion. Paraphrase loops are present: "the cabin walls whisper" / "the cabin door creaks" / "the cabin walls humming" restate ambiance without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("time is a cruel editor") and abstract phrasing ("distill chaos into narrative") recur without fresh specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (setting + mood), but key beats (the dream, the grave) are told rather than shown. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-density beats: "The trembling calm of the morning fog seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for her to name the miracle" stacks modifiers and anthropomorphizes fog without advancing pressure. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("whispered silhouette," "hidden heartbeats," "faint silver line") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties. Paraphrase loops recur: "maps emotional terrain" is restated as "mapped the emotional terrain of hope and fear" within two paragraphs, and "ordinary miracles" is repeated five times across the piece. Template cadence is evident in repeated "She [verb]" openings across a dozen sentences. Sentence-level propulsion is sluggish; many lines restate the same meditative stance without new information or tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "a breath between storms" recurs three times with minimal reweighting; "held breath" and "breath between storms" overlap; "saturated hush" appears twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" openers and "The [noun]" sentence stems. Figurative language is dense ("cloak humming with resonance," "liquid ripple like a nervous heartbeat," "crystal shards…sang with the wind") but coherence slips—crystal "shards" that "sang" and then "dissolved into mist" lack physical logic. "Smiled softly brightly" is ungrammatical. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is uneven. Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence in the opening and closing beats carries metaphor or elevated diction ("conduit for induced currents of memory," "living map of regret," "gritty, ethereal chorus")—without pattern-teaching or payoff that justifies the accumulation, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "imperfect miracles" recurs four times with minor variation; "induced currents" appears six times, often in adjacent lines without functional shift (−0.4). Template cadence in the final third: "She whispered… She remembered… She arranged… She lifted… She stepped… She felt… She turned" (−0.5). Clarity remains legible but momentum sags. No major grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.6)
    Rhythm is deliberate and often effective (balanced parallelism, cadenced repetition). However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "resounding hush" opens and recurs without evolution; "spiral arbitration" is repeated with minor variation; "journeying inward while walking out" cycles three times. Template cadence is present ("She felt," "She knew," "She stepped"). Figurative density is high in every beat without clear pattern payoff, and several metaphors muddle (a dictionary "whispers," margins are "wanderingly exact," silence is "resounding"). Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation. Applying cumulative artifact penalties: paraphrase loops −0.4, template stems −0.4, figurative overload −0.3, total −1.1, plus baseline issues yield the score.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and thematic redundancy: "clocks measured not time but the intervals between breaths" is restated multiple times across the final third, and the mantle clock key sequence ("lifted… turning it slowly… placed… back") recycles gestures without propulsion (−0.6 for loops and template cadence). Information density is moderate; many lines elaborate atmosphere without advancing causality. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed ("quiet agreement between machine and nature" follows "razor edges").

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence is pervasive: "She knew," "She felt," "She smiled," "She began," "She emerged," "She placed," "She knew" again. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences (e.g., "the knowledge inside was only half the story; the hidden subway held the other half"). Stock metaphors cluster without payoff: "rows of books seem like veins of possibility," "symbols formed a map," "equations in the language of rain." Filter verbs ("She felt," "She knew," "She understood") dull immediacy in every beat, including the closure. Prompt elements are name-checked rather than integrated, yielding a checklist texture. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, filter-verb stack −0.5, stock metaphors −0.4 = cumulative penalty ~1.9, capping in the 4s.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings repeat patterns: "Mara had cultivated," "Mara listened," "Mara watched," "Mara lowered," creating template cadence across the protagonist's beats (−0.5). Stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "forgotten vein," "fireflies trapped in glass," "pulse with the same rhythm," "etched into the very walls" (−0.4 for stock metaphor strings). Paraphrase loops appear: "teach endings how to begin" / "endings are merely the start of another cycle" and "the loop was not a trap but a teaching tool" restates the premise without added pressure (−0.2). Cumulative line-level debt totals approximately −1.1, and these artifacts touch the closure beat ("promise etched into the very walls"), which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence: "He [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" dominate; "haunted euphoria" appears five times, "regenerated covenant" six, "gently thorough" twice, "proximate causes" thrice—synonym churn without fresh information. Mixed metaphors: ink "soaking into parchment as if the paper itself were a tide" contradicts "pages turning with a sigh that seemed to echo the covenant's own breathing." Register drift into pseudo-philosophical abstraction ("proximate causes," "context changes") clashes with the archivist's embodied moment. Artifacts pervade the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 and 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dense figurative language clusters throughout: "platforms swallowed by thick ivy," "glimmered like a captive star," "catalyze a network of empathy," "curtains being drawn," "contract signed in invisible ink." Paragraph 2 loops synonym variants of rumor/chain/echo without advancing pressure. Template cadence: "She believed…She mapped…She sent…She gathered…She lifted…She recorded…She sent." The phrase "polite anarchy" recurs four times without evolving meaning. Key beats (ivy-cutting, fragment retrieval) are summarized rather than shown in real-time action. Sentence rhythm is monotone; no propulsion variation aligns with scene urgency. Multiple scaffold phrases ("the rumor claimed," "the moment…") dull momentum. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines in paragraphs 2 and 3; mixed register drift into abstract thesis-speak ("catalyze a network of empathy") in peak beats; filter-verb stacks and summary compression of the climax touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.1)
    Clarity is maintained; no pronouns drift and sequencing is legible. However, density is low: many sentences restate the premise in new metaphors without advancing pressure—"absorbed languages like a sponge," then "layering itself beneath her nerves as if ink on parchment" is paraphrase churn. The piece stacks modifiers ("quiet blaze of lingering light," "locus where time folded upon itself") and template cadence runs appear: "She placed her hand…feeling…and…glowing…aligning…" in the climax beat. Filter verbs ("she could dowse," "she understood") dull immediacy. Figurative language is dense but often generic ("river of sound," "veil of sound," "harmonious chord"). These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and applying −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "edit history" / "editing history" / "edited history" across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "gravitational anomaly" recurs eight times in static constructions. Template cadence is pervasive—"I felt … I turned … I whispered … I set … I realized"—across seven consecutive beats. Stock metaphors ("garden," "tapestry," "beacon," "slow tide") stack without coherent vehicle logic. Register drifts into corporate abstraction ("contingent relationships," "ambient gravity," "intentional threads") that clashes with the lyric frame. Figurative density in the middle third obscures causal linkage rather than sharpening it. No loops touch the closure beat directly, but their spread dulls momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.9)
    Persistent paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "joyful sorrow filled Arlen's chest" / "the joyful sorrow lingered in Lira's heart"; "mapping silence" recurs five times without added pressure; "luminous harbor" appears in opening, midpoint, and close as motif without functional variation. Stock metaphors dominate peak beats: "invisible gestures," "living stave," "trembling chords," "frozen memories." Template cadence runs through both shards with identical stems: "He began by positioning... He then lifted... She lifted... She pressed..." (−0.6 for template cadence, −0.4 for paraphrase loops, totaling −1.0 in Q7). Figurative density in most sentences (e.g., "silver sigh," "mute grammar," "hidden score") without pattern-teaching flattens clarity. The piece reads as two drafts of the same scene rather than escalating or reweighting material.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: the archive is "lost civilization archive" then "lost civilization archive carved into a hollow basalt dome"; "volcanic tenderness" appears four times without evolving meaning. Template cadence dominates: "He [verb]" openers in six consecutive sentences mid-piece. Metaphors muddle: "lava, bright and tender" contradicts the physical properties of lava, and "dust danced like ash" blurs vehicle and tenor. The final paragraph stacks three summary sentences that restate the redemption without propulsion. High-pressure beats default to elevated diction ("analytically intuitive," "fierce love tempered") that clashes with embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy ornamentation and paraphrase loops flatten momentum: "entangled memories" recurs six times with near-synonymous phrasing, "drumming" and "rhythm" churn across adjacent lines without new detail, and template cadence ("Each ripple sang," "Each beat sending," "Each chime echoing") stacks in the middle third. Purple constructions ("auroral in hue, painting the night," "liquid light through the soil") obscure rather than sharpen sense. The final two paragraphs loop thematic summary ("became more than a story," "keep dreaming," "bounded the world together") without propulsion. No significant artifact directly obscures the closure beat, but pervasive density issues and synonym churn justify a −1.0 to −1.4 deduction in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.1)
    Loop and scaffold artifacts pervade: "The map, a relic...was annotated" / "the folded map...its creases"; "whisper" and synonym variants ("faint," "quiet," "soft") churn across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "He [verb], [verb], and [verb]" runs dominate action sequences. Stock metaphors ("age-worn veins," "living vein," "steel veins") repeat the same vehicle without fresh tenor. Figurative density in most sentences of high-pressure beats (coin placement, tunnel entry, box opening) lacks pattern-teaching or payoff. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("labyrinth breathe," "his rhythm"), triggering −1.7 baseline and 9+ disqualification globally.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant overwriting and scaffold throughout. Paraphrase loops: "silent empathy, a language of listening without words, teaching shadows to listen" restates the same idea; "stillwater tension" appears three times without added meaning. Template cadence runs: "Its eyes were lenses... Its core concept was... Its purpose was..." Stack of abstract metaphors ("tapestry of hope," "shutters of water," "stitched stars," "unseen choir") in close succession without grounding in concrete action. Register drift into lyric elevation clashes with the mechanical "method was simple yet magical" framing. These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the guardian's physical task.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "quiet revolution" / "humble rebellion," "unspoken words" / "unvoiced dialogue," "forests of second thoughts" / "inner forests." Template cadence clusters: "She believed… She lifted… She watched… She whispered." Stock metaphors ("dust danced like fireflies," "seeds of reflection") and therapy-speak ("plant forests of second thoughts") appear in peak beats. Register drift into academic diction ("cognitive smoothness," "nascent rebellion") clashes with POV. Apply −1.4 for density of artifacts; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "seafoam clung to stone," "muscles sang of patience," "eyes glittered with a combative tenderness that could soften steel," "the horizon trembled as the earth itself seemed to shrink." Mixed metaphors ("shavings…glinted like moon-struck daggers" treats bone shavings as weapons) and template cadence ("She understood…She stepped…She placed…She realized") flatten momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "guarded hearts" recurs five times without evolving. The closure beat is swamped by metaphor, obscuring what Mara has lost or gained.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "remade hush" / "silence stitched together," "emotional void" / "hollow," "carving lightness" / "cutting away grief." Template cadence dominates—repeated "she [verb]" constructions and parallel declarations. Stock metaphors ("shavings fell like snow," "breath[e] without breaking the law") layer without coherent tenor. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "imagined," "understood") dull immediacy in climactic beats. Sentence openings repeat structural patterns without variation. Cumulative artifacts obscure momentum and deny entry to mid-bands.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "tremor of certainty" appears five times without evolving meaning; "lantern-moth hush" recurs as static atmosphere. Template cadence runs across multiple sentences: "He [verb], [result]" structures repeat without variation. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "breath held in moonlight," "watercolor of doubts," "ribbons of soft fire," "sugar in tea," "frost on glass"—mixed vehicles without coherent logic. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings (−1.4 in Q7). Artifacts touch closure beats (final paragraph), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops: "bartered awakenings" and "innocently cunning" appear in nine paragraphs, often rephrased without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [result]" structure recurs in seven sentences. Figurative language ("phoenix's ember," "breathing spine," "living canvas") appears in most sentences of the courtyard-awakening beat without pattern-taught payoff. Mixed metaphor: the concertina reed "tongue" both "speaks" and "sings" while also functioning as a "breathing spine." These artifacts cluster throughout, including the closure beat. Apply cumulative artifact penalty (−1.7 per patterned-artifact pack) and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.1)
    Substantial paraphrase loops and synonym churn across the text: "golden shadows" recurs nine times without reweighting; "texture of connection" appears four times in near-identical constructions; "artificial pilgrimage" is cycled without development. Template cadence runs: "The bell ringer [verb]..." opens multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("dust on ancient parchment," "threads of connection") and therapy-speak abstractions ("deeper sense of kinship," "mutual awareness") dull momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt like") cluster in high-pressure beats. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated deductions and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("curtains of intention," "filament of intention," "thread of intention," "veil," "constellation," "glow"), creating metaphor fatigue and register drift away from embodied perception. Paraphrase loops appear: the stencil's promise is restated across three beats without added pressure, and the final two paragraphs recycle "coordinates," "crane," and "curtains" in near-synonym churn. Sentence stems repeat ("She decided...she would," "The coordinates led...she knelt...she traced") across multiple paragraphs. Information density is low; many lines restate theme rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "inherited mystery" recurs five times; "reverse engineering the collapse" appears verbatim twice; "map cultural patterns," "measuring tape," and "onyx-ink" are repeated mechanically without reweighting. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]…She [verb]…She [verb]…" runs across most paragraphs. Figurative language is dense but often stock ("a perfume of incense and old ledger ink," "pages fluttered like restless crowds"). The closure beat is obscured by abstract declaration rather than concrete image. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "atoms of nostalgia" appears seven times without evolving meaning; "anguished joy" is repeated identically three times; "steadily unpredictable" recurs as "steady unpredictability" and "forever steady and yet forever unpredictable." Template cadence runs dominate ("He stepped… He knew… He walked… He smiled"). Purple prose stacks modifiers without clarity ("saffron-veil historian," "bronze prism pagoda at twilight," "vortex of forgotten childhoods"). The final paragraph dissolves into summary rather than propulsive image. Heavy scaffold and figurative muddle in peak beats trigger cumulative −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact caps.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "soft footfall…softly deliberate," "blooming library" recurs without new pressure, "shadow unbound" cycles four times without added meaning. Template cadence appears in stacked "He [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors clutter peak beats: "watercolor skies," "ribs of a great wing," "beacon for all who would seek hope." Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "sensed," "understood") dull immediacy in the second half. Figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff lowers clarity and momentum (−1.0). The final third carries multiple artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the contemplative tone, but multiple beats loop conceptually: "shedding layers" is restated across paragraphs without added pressure, and the chameleon's color shifts are described three times in near-synonyms. Stock metaphors appear ("candle in wind," "taut string," "gentle tide") in high-pressure moments. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") cluster in the middle third. The final journal entry explicitly moralizes rather than trusting image, triggering thematic echo penalty in Q5 and reducing line-level density here.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy reliance on stock metaphor strings ("meteor hush," "soft snow," "molten glass") and elevated diction that repeats across beats without variation or payoff (e.g., "meteor" appears in lines 2, 11, 17, 24 without evolving function). Paraphrase loops are evident: "the tunnel seemed to breathe" / "the tunnel walls glowed faintly" restate atmospheric presence without adding pressure. Template-stem runs appear in the ritual sequence ("I descended," "I paused," "I examined," "I realized," "I returned," "I placed"). Sentence openings cluster on subject-verb without rhythmic variation. The closure paragraph stacks comma-spliced clauses that blur momentum rather than propel. Apply −1.2 for patterned artifacts (stock metaphor strings, template cadence) and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks figurative vehicles ("dust swirled like slow snow," "ghostly impressions like a cartographer," "letters as tiny birds," "liquid light that pooled like a river"). Template cadence runs through the piece—repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and "she [verb]" stems without variation. Paraphrase loops: "unused love" appears six times, "goodbye letters" five times, with synonym churn ("unsent affection," "farewells that had never been delivered"). Mixed metaphors: letters are birds, then keys, then glowing ink rearranging into a map. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("carrying the stored unused love like a lantern"), triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "unspoken words" / "unvoiced poems" / "unheard verses" / "final unspoken word"; "rest" appears eight times with minimal variation. Template cadence dominates (e.g., "He realized…," "He learned…," "He left behind…"). Stock metaphors cluster without grounding ("pulse like quiet hearts," "sigh from the heavens," "scented with hope"). Figurative density in every sentence of peak beats (final third) triggers −0.7 for overwriting. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and establishes a lyric cadence, but figurative density is high across most sentences without meaningful variation: "metronome of sighs," "fractured lullaby," "wave functions that could charm the very fabric of existence," "blooming cactus," "chorus of renewal." Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The guard whispered the charm" / "Each word rippled outward"; "fractured lullaby" recurs five times without reweighting. Sentence stems recycle: "The guard [verb]" appears in seven paragraphs. Template cadence and stock metaphor strings ("trunks formed from pure light," "stitching destiny") accumulate, triggering −0.9 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; several beats restate the same idea (archive opening, sparks spreading) without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "hum of insight" appears seven times with near-identical phrasing; "wild frontier of his mind" is repeated verbatim; "the gear translocated / translocates" cycles without variation. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "He [verb]" or "The [noun]" stems. Purple-prose stacking in peak beats: "coiled like a vine," "painted the canopy in amber veins," "birds taking flight," "constellations across a steel sky"—figurative density without clear propulsion or cost. Stock metaphors ("layers of mental foliage," "knots that bound his curiosity") cluster in the climax. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same content ("the hum of insight surged, each vibration unraveling..."). Apply −1.4 for loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings; additional −0.3 for filter-verb stacks ("felt," "sensed," "realized") in peak beats. Total −1.7, touching closure; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rhythm varies across beats and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Template cadence appears in mid-passage runs: "Each turn reminded… Each stroke… each step" creates mild paraphrase loops, and figurative language clusters densely without pattern-teaching ("pulse of hope," "seed sleeping beneath sand," "tide to uncover it"). The closure beat's "bright star now etched upon her soul" and "world's hidden melodies" layer abstract metaphors that blur rather than sharpen the final image. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty but scaffold phrasing ("gently persistent," "wise ferry guides") recurs without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "unpardonable silence" recurs four times without reweighting; "frostbitten hope" three times; "seraphically mundane" twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates—"The bellhop...," "The guests...," "The bolt..." openers repeat mechanically. Figurative density is high ("bruised sapphire," "frostbitten hope," "seraphic mundanity," "slow heartbeat") without pattern-teaching or escalation, muddling clarity in peak beats. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("nerve regeneration experiment," "emotional or logical non-sequitur") that clashes with the fairy-tale frame. Sentence rhythm is uniform; no propulsion or breath variation. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("quiet promise," "seraphic mundanity"), triggering the −1.7 floor and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.3)
    Heavy overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "a diminutive titan, small enough to slip between towering scrolls yet radiating a presence that felt almost planetary" stacks modifiers without advancing action. Paraphrase loops appear ("cracked crown" recurs three times in adjacent paragraphs; "graceful collapse" echoes four times). Template cadence runs dominate: "He found... He entered... He reached... He emerged... He tucked... He walked." Stock metaphors ("slow tide," "dying ember," "low hymn") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to melt," "felt almost planetary") dull the prose. The closure image ("turned treachery into dust and restored the kingdom's rightful line") summarizes rather than dramatizing the cost, and the final paragraph's sermon on power and truth replaces scene pressure with exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive template cadence: "The practice of tapping rhythms turned..."; "The watermark's curve corresponded..."; "The torn atlas page, now complete..." recycles identical stems across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors—"floating like kelp in a lazy current," "holding its breath"—cluster without fresh specification. Paraphrase loops summarize the same discovery multiple times in the final third, flattening momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "hum" and synonyms ("vibrated," "resonant," "pulsed," "chorus") recur across most sentences without pattern-teaching or escalation. Template cadence dominates ("She lifted," "She realized," "She pressed," "She walked") in the final third. Stock metaphors—"secret lens to the cosmos," "key forged from starlight and steel"—muddle figurative logic. Figurative density clogs high-pressure beats (the climax stacks "thunderous serenity," "silent symphony," "rain on a quiet lake"). Loops and register drift disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8; baseline deduction −1.4 in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no major loops or scaffolding. Sentence rhythm is uniform, leaning on prepositional phrases and compound clauses without variation ("By accident," "During a night," "According to the myth"). Figurative language is dense (vapor as column, kite tail as prayer, moss singing) but occasionally mixed or slack ("the quiet voice of seedlings" after "fire, water"). Information density is moderate; many lines restate the premise (destiny can be awakened, tradition will be rewritten) without advancing pressure. No paraphrase loops touch the closure, so penalties remain light. Read-aloud test reveals syntactic monotony that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (salt wind, pine needle, crumpled photograph). However, several lines loop conceptually: "freeze her panic" / "freeze the grief" / "freeze alongside her"; "pearl of stillness" is defined, then re-explained, then invoked again. Template cadence appears in "she paused... she pulled... she pressed... she breathed... she knelt... she stood... she smiled... she walked"—a run of identical subject-verb openings across the final third. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("glass panes fogged by sea-salt breath," "hinges split like fractured ribs," "thin, luminescent ache," "walls close in," "threads of narrative," "wound that also heals") without clear pattern-teaching or selective deployment in peak beats; this reads as ornamentation rather than pressure-driven compression. Several metaphors blend or stack without clear vehicles: "luminescent ache" recurs but remains abstract; "threads" of memory/narrative/light overlap without coherent image. Paraphrase loop in the opening: "broken tarot card box, its hinges split like fractured ribs, each card a fragment…" and later "the cards slipped out like loose threads…" restate fragmentation. Template cadence in middle paragraph: "Each thread… Each turn… He arranged… He entered…" Clarity is maintained but momentum sags under decorative load. Coherent grammar and tense; no major technical errors. The overwriting reduces propulsion and triggers mid-band caps per artifact guidelines.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops blur momentum: "the ink could be coaxed into forming ephemeral patterns" / "the pattern rose like a ghostly tide"; "time itself was a fragile thread" / "the fragile tapestry of existence." Template cadence runs across several beats ("The drone hovered…projected…"; "Kael stood…declared…turned…thanked…promised…"). Stock metaphors ("bleached bone," "liquid mercury," "dying star," "guardian") and synonym churn ("serene anger" mentioned four times without variation) dull specificity. Figurative density in the climax ("bridge between present urgency and the lingering echo," "colossal spiral," "whisper of scent, a subtle promise") stacks without advancing causality, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.6) and the artifact cap that disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "contraband truth"/"contraband truths," "dormant networks" (six mentions), "dangerous liaison letter" (five mentions), "bravely conflicted" (twice), "echoing library under snow" (four times). These loops create synonym churn and template cadence that dull propulsion. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed: "breath forming a brief mist that vanished as quickly as the past she guarded" strains logic (breath doesn't vanish "as" the past; the metaphor conflates immediacy with permanence). Sentence openings vary, but information density is low in the second half, where consequences are summarized rather than dramatized. The final third recycles "echoing library under snow" and "dormant networks" without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy pattern artifacts pervade: "tranquil blaze" appears four times, synonym loops ("breathing," "whisper/whispered/whispering" cycle across adjacent lines), template stems ("She [verb]… She [verb]…"), and stock metaphors ("thorns glinting like tiny swords," "dawn cracked open"). Paraphrase loops in mid-section restate that sandbags anchor and roses respond without adding pressure. The closure beat ("tranquil blaze promising tomorrow") is touched by figurative recycling and abstraction, triggering escalated penalties. These artifacts measurably dull momentum and the final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and sensory texture is dense, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without escalation or pattern payoff (decorative "sleepwalking constellations," "feral lullaby," "voicing silence"). Template cadence in mid-section: multiple "He [verb]" and "The garden [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Paraphrase loop between "transliterates emotions into currents" (early) and "translates his quiet longing into a bright thread" (late). These artifacts cluster but do not obscure closure, so caps remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "echoing observatory" / "observatory's dome"; "rosewood pen nib" appears six times with decorative variation but no tightening function; "solemn playfulness" / "solemn yet playful" / "mischievous jest" repeat the same tonal claim. Template cadence runs: "She carried… She recalled… She set… She typed… She felt… She pressed… She descended." Metaphor muddle: "orbits of regret" are simultaneously "looping echoes of decisions," "newspaper front page that never turned," and "lattice of possibilities"—the vehicle shifts without coherent physical logic. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("felt a grin tug," "felt that the orbits had begun") dull immediacy. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for spread and cap all categories at 8.8 per artifact rules; artifacts appear in the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "rustle like phantom wind," "flickered like dying stars," "thin seam between now and what-once-was," "stardust upon every trembling heart." Multiple adjacent sentences restate the laboratory's transformation ("breathed once more," "living organ that breathed in," "walls themselves seemed to listen") in paraphrase loops. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "people arrived…each carrying…Lyra welcomed…allowing…translating…" Information density is low; many lines describe atmosphere without advancing character or plot. Register drifts into abstract ("collective hymn," "cohesive hymn") during the ending, dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "Each line was a question, each curve a tentative answer"; "Each grain of sand became a memory released, each line drawn an invitation." Figurative language clusters densely without clear payoff—"mist curling like breath," "pastel peace," "lilac-tinged veil." Stock metaphors ("captured sigh," "warm stone at the base of her spine") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "sensed") dull immediacy. Synonym churn ("hush," "quiet," "silence") loops across adjacent lines. Apply −1.2 in Q7 (template + loops + mixed metaphors) and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.2)
    Heavy pattern artifacts pervade: paraphrase loops ("the mosaic stepping stone" repeated in six paragraphs; "warm coldness" appears seven times with minimal variation), template cadence ("He felt," "He knelt," "He watched"), and stock metaphors ("wounded beacon," "living diagram of hope"). The final third contains synonym churn ("chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" → "chipped fragment" → "chipped stones") and therapy-speak labels ("cradle empathy," "aberrant mercy") in peak beats. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("retrocognitively trapped," "Conceptual Repricing") outside the POV's established lexicon. Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphors −0.3, cumulative −1.3 plus final-third artifact cap violation disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting saturates peak beats: "his voice a chorus of rusted brass and liquid violet, each note intertwining with the orchard's natural rhythm" stacks metaphors without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops recur—"echoes rose," "echoes cascade," "final echo drift"—across adjacent lines without new information. Template cadence runs appear: "The ghost [verb], [result]" structures repeat. Stock metaphor strings ("haunted by a stage ghost," "curtain call of night itself") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "felt") dull immediacy in the final third, triggering −0.9 baseline plus −0.5 for filter clusters, totaling −1.4 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy template cadence dominates: "She had spent…she felt…she realized…She programmed…She smiled…She recorded…She knew…she felt…She recorded" creates a mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loops appear ("the brain's somatic markers" repeated across adjacent sentences; "hidden pathways" / "illuminate hidden pathways"). Figurative language often tangles: "fractally precise patterns" is repeated as a label without physical grounding, and "willowglass hope—transparent yet resilient, bending light without breaking" mixes vehicle logic (glass that bends light is a prism, not resilient). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("willowglass dream painted in light"), triggering the elevated penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.9)
    Loop and scaffold issues: "voice of the unknown" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "factually mystical" is used twice as decorative label; "float" and "glow" recur without functional differentiation. Template cadence in final third: "She understood... She smiled." Figurative density (vapor "like lanterns," leaf "bright as sunrise") clusters without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure. Clarity remains intact, but momentum sags under repetitive phrasing. Apply −0.8 cumulative for paraphrase loops and template stems; −0.4 for filter-verb stacks ("seemed to breathe," "seemed to adjust").

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from pervasive template cadence, paraphrase loops, and stock metaphor strings. Runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" structures dominate; adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure (e.g., "She understood… She realized…"). Figurative language is generic ("thin layer of sunrise," "canvas," "tapestry") and appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Scaffold phrases ("quietly inspired," "unearthed silence," "raw possibility") recur as ornament. Information density is low; pivotal beats (button placement, bridge formation) are told rather than shown with concrete action. Loops and synonym churn span the text, including the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: "silver hush" recurs four times, "prudently daring" appears twice as a label, "unused courage waits" is repeated. Template cadence is evident in parallel "he [verb]" constructions across the valley sequence. Paraphrase loops: "fixing what's broken" appears in beat one and is restated at closure as "fixing what's broken required both courage...and humility." Mixed metaphors: the pillbox "vibrated, releasing...light that rose like a phoenix" conflates mechanical and mystical registers. Scaffolding like "Thus, the burned spy" in the final paragraph signals summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe overwriting throughout: "spindrift serenity" appears four times, "palimpsest" three times, "closely attentive" twice, "percolate" twice—all within 600 words, creating synonym churn and template cadence. Mixed metaphors abound: "fog curled like spindrift" (spindrift is sea-spray, not fog), "thoughts percolate into mist" (percolation is filtration, not dissolution). Paragraph-level loops restate the same contemplative stance without adding pressure. Register drifts into elevated diction ("ambient awareness," "distill complexity") incongruent with a coachman's likely lexicon. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("spindrift serenity… percolated through his awareness" in the final third), triggering disallow-9+ and −1.2 penalty in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("careful sigh," "sang of patience," "delicate lattice of memory," "sharp gentleness," "chimney smoke flattens"), creating tonal coherence but slowing momentum and risking overwriting. Paraphrase loops appear: "fractured timelines" recurs without added pressure; "thrum" is restated as "hum," "vibration," "pulse," "resonant thrum" across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "She believes… She set… She traced… She felt… She realizes… She knelt… She moved… She knows… She feels… She leaves… She smiles" dominates the structural rhythm. Sentence openings lack variety. Clarity remains high, and no artifacts obscure causality, but density and propulsion suffer under decorative weight. Applying −0.8 for paraphrase/template issues and −0.4 for figurative density without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("silver ribbons dancing," "quivering hush lingered like a breath held," "darkness recoiled," "harbor hummed a lullaby"), triggering the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "protected vulnerability" recurs as label, "quivering hush" is restated four times without added pressure, and the phrase "rhythm of oars in water" appears twice in identical form. Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" stems and "The [noun]" openers, further reducing propulsion (−0.6). Combined artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the harbor's moonlit waters reflected...the resilient glow"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.8)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "translate isolation into independence" appears three times; "brittle awakenings" five times without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs through the final third ("Mira placed… She felt… She stepped… She whispered…"). Stock metaphors ("tide of clouds," "sea of ink") lack fresh collision. Mixed register: "atomically reflective" clashes with lyric tone. The scaffold visible in repetitive stems and synonym churn ("hum," "vibration," "pulse," "resonance") dulls the closure image. Figurative density in most sentences creates overwriting without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: figurative language in nearly every sentence ("pale sunrise hovering," "sequined ribbons," "mosaic of whispered confessions," "cascade of silver light") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops: "keeper of secrets" recurs with synonym variants; "prismatic quiet" appears three times without evolution. Template cadence in the middle: "She felt…She stepped…She realized…" Scaffold phrases ("simple yet profound," "role she could fulfill") lower density at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "cautiously hopeful" appears three times, "power plays" five, and "ethereal grit" recurs without evolving function. Template cadence dominates the final third ("She smiled… She taught… She transmitted…") with identical stems across consecutive sentences, triggering −0.6. Mixed metaphors clutter peak beats ("airwaves split like a mirror shattered," "ethereal grit… steady beat") without coherent vehicle logic. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph; applying the disallow-9+ rule and capping high bands at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "transfix," "mutiny," "reverberation," "constellation" stack figurative weight in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.7). Paraphrase loops: "Each step was a silent mutiny, the walls yielding space to his will" repeats the compass's earlier spatial control without advancing pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open "He [verb]" without variation. Stock metaphors: "walls close like a familiar wound," "blossoming map." Filter-verb stacks in the organ-activation beat ("seemed to sigh," "seemed to rewrite") dull immediacy. Line-artifact penalty pack totals approximately −1.4; artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph's "felt the weight," "understood," "realized"), triggering the disallow-9+ global cap and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Mara was very methodical" → "Her method was patient"; "the evidence disappears" → "even if the evidence disappears again"; "unifying opposites" recurs four times without variation. Stock metaphors ("thin line of blood," "flame that would guide her") and abstract intensifiers ("perpetual veil," "furrowed hush") accumulate without propulsion. Figurative density in nearly every sentence—"lance the void," "battlefield," "chorus of lives"—obscures rather than clarifies. Sentence stems repeat ("She believed," "She felt," "She whispered"), creating mechanical rhythm. These artifacts pervade the final third, including closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs cluster in high-pressure beats: "She descended… each step echoing," "She whispered… The answer arrived," "She placed… feeling the… spirit loosen." Stock metaphors ("captured heartbeat," "distant shore of honor") and synonym churn ("spongey dread" appears three times without added pressure) reduce information density. The copper nail's glint "like a captured heartbeat" is strained and self-contradictory. Sentence openings ("She descended," "She whispered," "She placed," "She rallied," "She wrote") follow identical stems across the climax, triggering template-cadence and filter-verb stack penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose avoids template cadence, but paraphrase loops recur: "The music and the image merged" immediately followed by "He realized that to sculpt possibility..."; "luminous disbelief" appears three times in near-identical phrasing across paragraphs. Figurative language density is high throughout ("thread of sunrise," "cascade of amber light," "doorway to re-write") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating ornamental muddle rather than precision. Several abstract noun phrases ("an amnesty," "a promise of redemption") float without concrete anchors. The prose is grammatically clean and propulsive in places, but the accumulation of decorative metaphor and synonym churn (scaffold wrap flutters described multiple ways without advancing meaning) flattens momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is moderate; most sentences advance character or setting. However, the piece cycles through "polished calm," "dusky," and "territorial markers" as fixed phrases across multiple beats without deepening their charge—template cadence and synonym loops in "calm…perceptively calm…polished calm that never cracked…remained perceptively calm…the same polished calm" (−0.4). Figurative language ("bright arc," "low chord," "quiet purpose") clusters in the reflective second half without pattern-teaching, risking decorative drift (−0.3). No critical opacity or causality break, but propulsion sags in the middle paragraphs where exposition summarizes LoopForge's rise rather than dramatizing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She knew…She realized…She felt…She understood" across consecutive beats. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("restless night," "fragrant paper curling like a sigh," "residue of her recent lucid dreams") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties. Mixed metaphors ("burden…settle in her chest," "words…mend…as gently as sunrise mends night") reduce clarity. Stock phrases ("the weight lift," "the promise of a new understanding dawning") dull momentum. Cumulative artifact penalties: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.6, figurative density −0.5, total deduction ~−1.5 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.9)
    Template cadence pervades: runs of "She [verb]" openings across a dozen sentences in the middle third (−0.6 for patterned artifact). Paraphrase loops are frequent—"unbend a frozen confession" is restated as "the ice's rigid grip," "the confession shatters," "the confession now free," "sealing the confession" without added pressure (−0.4 for synonym churn). Stock metaphor strings dominate peak beats: "calm blade," "silver birds," "sword unsheathed in peace," "retreating armies" (−0.5 for coherence debt; mixed vehicle logic). Information density is low: many sentences restate the druid's purpose or the seed's hunger without advancing stakes. Filter verbs ("she feels," "she knows") stack without voice motivation. The opening paragraph introduces a magic trick and illusionist's cape that vanish without causal connection (−0.3 for unresolved set-up). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her heart unbent, her purpose clear"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], and [noun] [verb]" runs through the middle third without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear: "anxious elation" is restated three times across the piece without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster: "ancient vines that whispered histories," "drum announcing a long‑awaited battle," "tapestry of collective desire." Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the climax obscures rather than sharpens the action. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood or reiterate setting without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often strained: "trammel any caution," "threads of repair," "verses in an ancient poem." Several metaphors are mixed or vague (roots as needles, ash transmuted into hope, amber as lantern). Paraphrase loops appear: the story restates soul-patching and root-stitching across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is evident in repeated "She [verb]" stems and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same symbolic action (sigil-carving, soot-pressing, amber-spreading) without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "the applause I once craved was now a quiet echo, a valley longing" restates the same sentiment across adjacent clauses without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the final third ("I wrote," "I stepped," "I realized"), and stock metaphors (dust like sunrise, lights like fireflies) stack without specificity. Mixed register: "wresting meaning from metal" and "scaffolding that insulated my fear" are strained, abstract constructions. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering accumulation cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing recur throughout: "the seed's growth to the way language evolves" / "translate its future verses" / "every translation was a seed, and every seed a promise" restates the same analogy three times without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("She whispered... She recorded... She placed...") creates rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("invisible ladder," "touching distance," "gentle breeze") accumulate without fresh specificity. Abstract nominalization dominates ("physics of transition," "spirit that had haunted her ambitions") where concrete nouns and strong verbs would propel. Density is low; many sentences perform a single job and could be cut or combined.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully across paragraphs, and sensory detail is vivid and selective (brine and cedar, pale teal water, cold glow). However, multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "The creel's woven walls whispered of distant coasts" is echoed by "the creel answered with a rustle, as if the sea itself approved"; "fluctuation was not merely magic but a reminder" recaps information already shown. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "He decided to smelt... The furnace... glowed... By accepting... he coaxed... The key emerged." Several filter-verb stacks ("He realized," "He whispered," "He felt") in reflective beats dull immediacy. Figurative language is dense (fire that does not burn, water that does not drown) but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. The final scroll image charges closure, yet scaffold phrasing and synonym churn reduce overall propulsion by roughly −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.4)
    Purple prose density is high throughout: "trembling gleam," "heartbeat paused at the edge of a hesitation," "vines of light," "bridge" of air. Paraphrase loops appear ("the walls between hearts" recurs four times with minimal variation). Template cadence runs through the ritual: "She moved… She knelt… She lifted… She whispered… She placed… She vowed." Register drift into abstract philosophical language ("the crown was a ritual, an act of binding") clashes with the inspector role. Figurative language in nearly every sentence obscures rather than charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language or poetic phrasing ("ivy whispered," "sky bruised with dusk," "leaves a soft choir," "accordion bellows humming a low hymn of hope"), reducing clarity under accumulative pressure. Multiple paraphrase loops: "accordion bellows" and "patched tape" recur in adjacent sentences without advancing information; "daringly methodical" is stated three times across the piece. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "I [past-tense verb]" stems. The closure paragraph leans heavily on metaphor ("ivy part like curtains," "horizon," "low hymn of hope") without grounding the final action in concrete sensory detail. Syntax varies but density is uneven—some lines carry multiple jobs while others ornament without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "cyclically reversed" appears five times, "propagation delays" four times, "cautious exuberance" three times, all in identical syntactic slots without variation or payoff. Template cadence dominates: "We [verb], [object]" and "The [noun] [verb], [result]" recur across twenty sentences. Stock metaphors ("letters that rearranged themselves," "floating glyphs," "echoing syllables") replace concrete action. Mixed metaphor: letters "sang," vowels "burst into radiant laughter," words "grew as luminous petals" without coherent vehicle. Figurative density in the final third (garden sequence) obscures the closure image rather than sharpening it. Applying −1.4 for template cadence, loops, and figurative muddle that touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.2)
    Figurative density overwhelms clarity: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphors ("lattice of archives," "cold resonance that opened a perforated destiny," "map of choices broken into tiny holes like frost on glass"). Template cadence runs appear ("She had only weeks," "She lifted," "She placed," "She chose"). Paraphrase loops abound: the violin "sing[s] the sighs of a forgotten winter" and later "sang its final frost-laden chord." Register drift into pseudo-poetic abstraction ("propagate hope," "gilded annex") clashes with concrete action. Information density is low; many lines restate concepts without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity and grammar are clean. Figurative language is dense but controlled: "threshold of stillness," "radiant hush," "luminous hush" recur without muddle. However, multiple lines loop or paraphrase: the grotto's "radiant hush" and "luminous hush" bookend the piece with near-identical phrasing; "lucidly watchful" and "reverent purpose" are asserted twice without added detail. The final third summarizes theme rather than advancing image: "a covenant with the universe," "a beacon," "a promise that even as oblivion loomed" stack abstract claims. Template cadence appears in the closing: "She knew… She lingered… She placed…" (three sequential subject-verb stems). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences vary in structure and the opening anchors voice effectively. Information density is moderate; many lines advance atmosphere but fewer drive causal pressure (e.g., "her eyes reflecting the violet haze" adds texture without changing options). Paraphrase loops appear: "the cycle of rebirth pulse through her veins" / "the cycle had turned once more" / "let the memory of forgiveness cycle through her thoughts like the turning of the seasons" restates the same image across paragraphs. "Scallop" as a verb (heart scalloping, step a soft scallop) is quirky but not earned by prior patterning, reading as decorative. No figurative muddle or template cadence, but the recurrence of "cycle," "rebirth," and "forgiveness" without added pressure constitutes synonym churn. Elevated diction ("umbral," "phosphorescent") is consistent but occasionally tips toward purple without sharpening the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She sensed...," "She lifted...," "She whispered...," "She then reached...," "She stepped back...," "She walked down...," "She smiled...," "She tucked...," "She turned back..." across fifteen sentences creates mechanical rhythm. Metaphors stack without variance—"weight of...guilt," "knot of certainty," "cloak of doubt," "mantle," "prism of possibility"—and several are mixed: a "knot" is "unhooked" (knots are untied), a "cloak" "settles" yet is also a "garment that draped...like fog." Register drifts into corporate abstraction ("protected vulnerability," "living conversation") in peak beats, dulling specificity. Artifacts touch the closure sequence (final three paragraphs loop "reminded," "reminding," "ready to offer"), triggering cumulative penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically controlled but suffers from template cadence and conceptual paraphrase loops. Examples: "She believed that truth could be weaved…each circle a cipher…" then "She understood that to teach…she must first withhold…" recycles the same declarative stance without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: "cells rewound each night like a moonlit tide" conflates biological reversal with lunar imagery in a way that obscures rather than clarifies. Stock phrases ("glassy mirror," "veil of stars," "promised secrets") dull specificity. Information density is mid-range; many sentences advance setting or mood without plot consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear frequently: "the pulse was a faint thrum" / "the pulse left wandering" / "the pulse would wander again" recycle the same content without added pressure, warranting −0.2. Template cadence is pervasive: "She watched... She inhaled... She felt... She knew..." across six consecutive beats, triggering −0.6. Figurative density ("lattice of wind currents," "invisible compass," "living compass") stacks without variation in the middle third, adding −0.4 for overwriting. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("continuity," "resolve settle into her marrow") that clashes with the embodied POV. Cumulative deductions and artifact presence in the final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy pattern-artifact debt: "lingering luminance" recurs seven times, "accommodates impossibilities" four times, "brilliant dimness" twice, "garden folly keystone" three times—synonym loops and label repetition pervade without functional variation. Template cadence in multiple beats: "He then stepped... began mist walking... a method taught... to glide..." and "He placed his palm... feeling the lingering luminance pulse... a secret cadence..." register as list-like sequencing. Figurative density is high throughout ("fireflies that refused to be measured," "heart a garden folly") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, and metaphors mix vehicles (keystone as "anchor," heart as "garden folly," magic as "candle" and "fireworks"). Stock metaphor strings ("dim candle in a world of mechanized fireworks") and elevated diction in peak beats clash with the POV's humble stance. Paraphrase loops: "the lingering luminance from the keystone" / "the stone's glow was not just light" restate within two lines. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph and disqualify 9+ globally; baseline deduction −1.4 in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for closure contamination, plus artifact cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.6)
    Line-level craft is polished but overwritten. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "meteor hush," "luminous vow," "sleeping leviathan," "coral in the salt-filled gloom." Mixed metaphors and register drift (e.g., "the color of that chord was a deep teal that pulsed like a heartbeat") muddle clarity without enhancing pressure. Paraphrase loops and template cadence are evident: "He believed… He understood… He lifted… He walked…" Repetitive sentence openings and uniform length create monotony, and the high density of metaphor in peak beats obscures rather than sharpens the moment. Apply −0.6 for density, −0.4 for template cadence, total −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from overwriting: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats deploys figurative language ("ambered observatory deck," "violet mist," "backwards prophecy," "wavelength align," "stellar doubt," "distill the murmurs," "thread through the cracks of time") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.7 for density. Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "dying stars," "fading signal," "contracting universe" recur without added pressure; "quietly enthusiastic" and "stellar doubt" are label-only. Template cadence appears in multiple beats ("He believed… He began… He lifted… He whispered…"). Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.4 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "cloak dripping with sighs," "terror pulse like a second heart," "distant intimacy lingering." Mixed metaphors appear (sea monsters as maps, ink crystallizing into statues that hum). Paraphrase loops recur: "echo of sacrifice" is restated across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence: "She lifted... She whispered... She felt..." runs dominate. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the weight of centuries of unfinished farewells") during closure. Density −0.7, coherence −0.5, loop −0.4; artifacts touch closure: cap all 9+ globally and apply −1.6 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paragraph-long sentences with stacked modifiers create a stately rhythm but low information density: "He realized that his brittle devotion, though fragile, had been the key; the earnest naive heart could endure the impossible if it held to a single, steady beat" restates theme without advancing action. Paraphrase loops appear in the final third (bell restoration described three times with synonym variation: "healed," "settled," "whole"). Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt") cluster in reflective beats. Template cadence: "The mage...now smiled, knowing that..."; "And as the bell's reverberations faded...the river swelled." Minimal proofreading issues, but density and propulsion suffer under ornamental layering.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The midnight ridgeway…stretched…" / "edges a whisper…"; "She carried…a reminder…" / "The label glimmered…its deep blue swirl echoing…"; "Their silence was a mirrored hush…" / "each breath a ripple…". Filter-verb stacks cluster ("she realized," "she knew," "she felt") without immediacy. Stock metaphors: "silver ribbon," "mirrored glass," "corridor of light and shadow," "ancient eye." Mixed metaphor: hush settling "like mirrored glass" conflates auditory and visual without coherence. Patterned-artifact penalty: −1.4 for loops, template stems, and stock strings across beats; final third contamination disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8. Synonym churn: "memory" / "remembrance" / "narrative" cycle without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy overwriting pervades: "kaleidoscopic waterfall scattering light like shattered glass," "ancient freshness...wrapped around her like a promise fulfilled," "silent verses of frozen dew." Mixed metaphors cluster in the final third ("mossy stones that sang," "touch of wonder surged through her veins"). Template cadence runs—"She [verb]...she [verb]"—appear across multiple beats without taught pattern. Paraphrase loops: the harmony sought/bridge between mind and heart is restated in four adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Figurative density in nearly every sentence flattens momentum rather than propelling it.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries rhythm and selective sensory detail (moss-dulled buckle, vine-reinforced rope, leaves like confetti), but template cadence and paraphrase loops proliferate. "Soundless echo" appears four times; "watcher's burden" three times; variations on "the seeker felt/realized/decided" recur across adjacent beats. Stock metaphors ("cathedral of leaves," "cascade of tiny leaves fell like confetti") and elevated diction ("lofty silence," "vaulted dome") cluster in the opening and closing thirds without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final paragraph's "soundless echo of purpose that would linger long after he was gone" and "his silhouette echoing the soundless echo" stack redundancy at the closure beat, dulling the image. Filter-verb runs ("He felt," "He smiled, realizing," "aware that") appear in three consecutive high-pressure lines mid-piece. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template cadence (−0.5), stock metaphor strings in peak beats (−0.4), and closure-beat redundancy escalation (−0.6) totals approximately −1.7 in Q7; artifacts touch the closure image, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe template cadence and paraphrase loops throughout: "slices through pretense" repeats five times with minimal variation, "complementary opposites" appears four times in identical phrasing, and "vivify/vivified/vivifying" recurs eight times without functional escalation. Sentence stems converge ("He [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]," "Kael [verb]") across 12+ lines. Figurative language is dense but often mixed or stock ("ink in water," "dust after collapse," "ice under sunrise"). Paragraphs in the final third are paraphrase loops: the dojo's transformation and shared heartbeat are restated three times without added pressure. Information density is low—many lines rephrase rather than advance. The closure beat is dulled by these artifacts, triggering the Q7 disallow-9+ clause and cross-cap.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "blade of sound began to macerate the heavy silence, grinding it into fine particles that floated like ash, each speck humming with possibility" stacks metaphor without causal clarity (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "mournfully eager" recurs as label; "tending to the unspoken" and "restore lost laughter" are repeated without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence: "The [X], [gerund], [abstract effect]" structure appears in seven sentences (−0.5). Stock metaphors: "weep," "breathing back," "fireflies desperate to be seen" (−0.3). Cumulative artifacts touch closure beat, triggering −1.7 total and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "wait… waiting… wait" across three paragraphs; "boundaries of light" appears five times with synonym churn ("porous," "delineating," "no longer confined"). Template cadence in the middle third: "The guardian felt… The guardian, aware… The pendant now…" Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to hum," "felt the moment," "understood that") dull immediacy. Figurative density is high but often mixed ("wings of mist-woven verses"). Penalty pack: −1.2 for loops, template stems, and filter stacks touching multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The powder glowed faintly" / "The resulting elixir hissed, then settled" / "A frozen bloom of light unfurled" cycle through synonym variations without added pressure. Template cadence dominates: "He mixed… He brushed… He waited… He adjusted…" runs for six consecutive beats, triggering −0.6. Stock metaphors ("dying hearth," "silent promise" ×3, "frozen bloom" ×4) stack without specificity. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax without pattern-teaching or payoff, applying an additional −0.5 for density in high-pressure beats. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("a silent promise that even broken things can bloom anew"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from pervasive scaffold and synonym loops: "serenely electric" appears four times, "hush" recurs without functional variation, and multiple sentences restate the same concept (e.g., "the tower seemed to understand" immediately follows "she whispered her intention"). Template cadence dominates with parallel "she [verb]" constructions across adjacent lines. Figurative language stacks densely ("like a broken harp," "comet's tail," "silver lantern") without pattern-teaching or payoff, and the final third continues this density through the closure beat. Apply −1.2 for loops and template cadence touching closure, plus an additional −0.5 for filter-verb stacks and register drift into abstract diction during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy overwriting: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated imagery ("ribbons," "lattice of sound," "phosphorescent threads," "compass of reclaimed time"), flattening rhythm and creating density without information gain. Paraphrase loops appear ("vanishing commuter ferry" / "ferry that had never truly left," "paradox of permanence and transience" / "permanent transient heartbeat"). Template cadence in the middle third ("He believed… He lifted… He smiled…") and synonym churn ("resiliently positive" appears twice with identical phrasing) trigger −0.8 in Q7. Filter verbs ("feeling," "knowing") stack in reflective beats without voice motivation. The final image is clean, preventing further penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated diction ("walls that bent perspective like liquid glass," "fibers humming with a rational enchantment," "patterns of light and shadow rearranging themselves as memories alter"). Paraphrase loops abound: lines 3–5 restate "illusion shifts" three times; lines 16–18 recycle "pulse/pattern/rhythm." Template cadence runs dominate (15+ sentences begin "He [verb]" or "The [noun]"). Figurative density in high-pressure beats (final paragraph) triggers −0.7; loops and stems add −0.8; total artifact penalty −1.5 routed here. Information density is near-zero—most sentences describe without advancing knowledge or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "balancedly curious" appears twice as a label, "somber" and "marvel" recur in fixed pairings without variation, and "expand/expanding/unfolded horizons" cycles through multiple paragraphs without added specificity. Template cadence runs appear ("She felt… She imagined… She whispered…"). Filter verbs ("felt," "imagined," "noting how") stack in reflective passages. Metaphoric density ("the pull of the anchor link echoing in her chest," "alien light braided with distant suns") clusters without clear vehicle logic, and "mournful" is applied to both lanterns and precision in contradictory ways. The cumulative effect dulls momentum and obscures the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear across adjacent lines: "faint pulse" recurs four times, "whisper" and "echo" cycle without variation, and "statues bowed their heads in reverent silence" echoes the earlier "statues of forgotten poets wept marble tears." Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "the [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("beacon for the vulnerable voices," "bridge that linked the living and the dead") reduce specificity. The final third is cluttered with figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, dulling the closure beat. Information density is low; many lines restate the same atmospheric claim without advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("hulking mouth," "serpents waiting," "jellyfish bellies," "veil of pressure that tasted of brine"), and several metaphors strain coherence (sea "inhaled and held its breath" while also pressing, walls "translucent like jellyfish bellies" without clear light source). Template cadence runs appear: "She aligned… she whispered… she felt… she raised… she activated… she stepped… she buried," a seven-beat stem repetition that flattens propulsion in the second half. Paraphrase loops recur: "invisible things" appears five times, "gold flecks" six, often in adjacent lines without added pressure. Line-level clarity is adequate, but information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere or codex properties rather than advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated modifier ("frozen lantern," "legal phantom," "ephemeral patterns," "crystalline whispers") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear ("the ghost's heartbeat counter synchronized with the rhythmic tapping of Mara's own pulse"; "a single, steady pulse—Mara's own"). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" across the second half. Figurative muddle: "frozen lantern beneath a midnight snowfall" and "opal walls" amplifying a chime lack coherent vehicle logic. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("even a porcelain shard could rewrite destiny"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is dense with figurative language and thematic repetition ("echo tunnel," "flawed diamond," "texture into sound," "death of a language"), creating a lyric but sluggish cadence. Multiple sentences restate the same content (e.g., "the language of texture would be locked forever" / "a secret for no living tongue" / "those who listen to stones"). Template rhythm appears: "The storyteller [verb]... He [verb]... The canyon [verb]..." Overwriting is pervasive—nearly every line carries metaphor or elevated diction without variation in density or propulsion. No significant loops obscure causality, but momentum is dulled by ornamental accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence pervades: "I slipped... I was... I lifted... I placed... I felt... I realized... I walked..." runs through the entire piece without syntactic variation (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "the garden's underground walls seemed to pulse" followed by "their stone veins glowing" restates the same image (−0.2). Stock metaphor strings ("frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed," "gravitationally playful") recur as ungrounded labels rather than concrete images (−0.4). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: nearly every sentence carries metaphor ("a ribbon of stars," "frost can melt into laughter," "chorus of leaves"), obscuring rather than sharpening the closure beat (−0.3). Information density is low; multiple sentences rephrase mission objectives and thematic claims without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.3)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "The note traveled… slipping… and the statues felt…" is immediately followed by "He lifted… placed… and the shell erupted…" with identical [He/The X verb] stems across adjacent beats. Stock metaphors ("like sunrise," "like a breeze," "like living notes") appear in most high-pressure sentences without fresh vehicle logic. The phrase "resonantly soft" is recycled three times as identical filler. Accumulated artifacts (−0.9 in Q7 for loops + template runs + stock metaphor density) and mid-band propulsion (information density is low; every sentence restates the same transformation) yield a score in the 4s.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "respectfully rebellious gait" / "respectful rebellion"; "brittle hush" recurs three times without evolving; "cobalt arcade" / "cobalt light" / "cobalt lights" cycles mechanically. Template cadence dominates the middle third—"The bottle pulsed... Milo lifted... He set... When the drone hovered... In that fleeting silence"—with identical subject-verb stems across seven consecutive sentences, triggering −0.6. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "banner of surrender," "metallic bird," "halo that pulsed," "frightened sparrow," "quiet thunder" stack within two paragraphs, mixing vehicles (banner, bird, halo) without coherence, costing another −0.4 for register drift and metaphor muddle. Information density is low; scaffolding like "He knew that broken promises could only heal where the voids between them were acknowledged, a truth he pursued to find where broken promises heal" restates the mission without advancing it, and the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than trusting the image. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("a reminder that every frontier... can be crossed with care"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping Q7 at 8.7 before deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the silence was not emptiness but possibility" rephrases "interpret silence as possibility" across multiple beats without adding pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("She lifted… placed… began to sing… read… realized… repaired… breathed… kept singing… descended… placed… smiled"). Mixed metaphors abound: fog "cloaking" in a "veil" then "revealing," wind bells "chiming inside the chime of wind bells." Stock phrases ("quietly persistent," "whispering gleam," "misting hush") recur mechanically. Register drift into "conduit for the unheard" and "Conceptual Repricing" clashes with the mystical frame. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her mission… had birthed a new symphony").

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing images anchor effectively. Information density is uneven: many lines restate the reawakening process with synonym churn ("dormant narratives," "analog memories," "hidden geometry," "hyperbolic transformations"). The phrase "observed solitude" appears twice in near-identical constructions (penultimate and final paragraphs), creating a template loop. Stock metaphors ("ghostly fireflies," "beat again when needed") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the tug," "knew that") in reflective passages reduce propulsion. These patterns lower clarity and momentum, especially in the final third, disqualifying 9+ and applying −0.8 cumulative artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.9)
    Density of figurative language is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: "fragments of forgotten songs," "books themselves seemed to breathe," "luminous absence," "cipher of longing," "runaway dream," "sea holding a secret lantern" appear in nearly every sentence. Multiple paraphrase loops: "translate the palette's glow into tangible images" / "The resulting photographs became a cipher"; "vitalize these images" / "vitalizing the photograph with a pulse"; "whispered the cipher into the wind" / "the archipelago would carry it across the islands." Template cadence with "She [verb]" stems across four consecutive sentences mid-passage. Filter-verb stack: "She believed," "She recalled," "She sensed," "She recognized," "She realized" in close proximity. Apply cumulative artifact penalty of −1.4 and disallow 9+ globally per Q7 guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.4)
    Dense figurative language pervades nearly every sentence ("sigh," "whispering void," "enveloped secrets," "tapestry woven from forgotten dreams," "luminous filament," "quiet promise") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.6 for overwriting. Paraphrase loops appear: "the locksmith's own yearning for release" restates the "improbable longing" established earlier; "a reminder that even the most delicate secrets can be unlatched" echoes the premise already dramatized. Template cadence runs through the final third: "He realized…," "He turned…," "He left…," "He stepped…," each opener framing a summary beat rather than scene action, adding −0.4. Stock metaphors ("veil of doubt," "bridge between fear and courage") reduce specificity. Information density is low: many lines restate the central concept without advancing action or altering stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "stolen memories were not lost but hidden" and "stolen memories were no longer hidden, but now rooted" restate the same claim across paragraphs. Template cadence runs cluster in the hull-cataloging sequence ("She moved… she reached… she lifted… she realized"). Figurative density ("secrets began to whisper," "stories are alive," "truth settle like freshly turned soil") crowds several beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. Clarity remains intact, but momentum sags under ornamental rephrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "forgotten library" / "lost codices" / "forgotten lore," "ancient stacks" / "ancient altar," "combative tenderness" stated three times without variation, "reversible exile" / "reversible journey" / "reversible pilgrimage." Template cadence dominates: "She felt... She felt... She placed... She followed... She whispered..." across a dozen consecutive sentences. The figurative density is high without payoff—"afternoon shadow caught in glass" is described four different ways (thin rectangle of darkness, quivering edges like a blade, fractured into ribbons of gold, dissolved into a cascade of light) but the metaphors contradict one another (solid blade vs. dissolving cascade). Stock phrasing clusters in peak beats: "tiny cartographers mapping the routes of hope," "battle fought with kindness," "heart beating anew with the rhythm of resilient hope." The artifact accumulation spans the closure beat, triggering the escalated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.4)
    Overwriting pervades: figurative language in nearly every sentence ("liquid amber," "living poem," "veil between worlds thinned," "tiny messenger of the other realms," "crystal beads," "secret glyph") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops: "radiant hush" recurs five times without evolving meaning; "succor" appears four times in identical function. Template cadence: "He [verb], his [noun] [participial phrase]" and "The [noun] [verb], and as [noun] [verb], its [noun] [verb]" repeat across multiple beats. Mixed metaphor: a seed "drinks" mist, then "absorbed the song," then "answered by scattering spores"—vehicle incoherence. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("radiant hush forever echoing").

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative language ("dark river," "pale fish," "muted hymn") is consistent and mostly coherent, but density is high across nearly every sentence without variation in pressure or payoff. Paraphrase loops abound: "hush that accumulates silence" is restated as "weight that pressed gently," "invisible weight," "veil of calm," and "lucid unrest...purest peace" with minimal added meaning. Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "As she loosened...," "One by one...," "As the last knot...." Stock metaphors (prism refracting light, spirits as fish) and elevated diction ("exhume," "interlaced," "lucid unrest") clash with the lack of concrete action. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere rather than advancing event or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "methodically curious" appears twice in identical phrasing; "whispered chapel" recurs as incantation without causal work. Figurative language is dense but often mixed: the map's tear is a "wound," "portal," and "scar" within three paragraphs, muddling the vehicle. Template cadence ("She paused… She whispered… She lifted… She realized…") stacks in the middle third, triggering −0.6. Sentences are rhythmically uniform; propulsion stalls in the reflective middle. The final paragraph's "soft glow" and "muted chorus" rely on stock mystical phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "letting go was not surrender but a transformation" / "the act of untangling … revealed" / "physics of letting go revealed itself" restates the same thesis five times. Template cadence: "He [verb], [noun]" runs across a dozen sentences. Stock metaphors: "ocean itself were sighing," "tiny stars drifting upward, a silent chorus." Figurative language appears in most sentences of the final third without pattern-teaching. Filter verbs cluster: "he thought," "he realized," "he sensed" in adjacent lines. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph). Deductions: paraphrase −0.6, template cadence −0.6, stock metaphors −0.4, filter stack −0.5; spread touching closure totals −1.7 and disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("midnight blossom," "luminous letters," "mist swirled"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "ghost in code" is restated four times, "encode/encoded" recurs across adjacent beats, and "driftingly alert" appears twice with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs through "He lifted… He pressed… He painted… He whispered" in the opening third. Purple-prose stacking ("looping lines and symbols, each stroke a cipher"; "cascade of luminous letters") in high-pressure beats reduces propulsion. Artifacts touch multiple beats but not the closure unit directly, so penalty remains in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but the piece suffers from density bloat: "a solitary tower that floated above the clouds like a frozen lighthouse" front-loads metaphor without on-page stakes to justify it. Paraphrase loops appear: "affectionate detachment" is named three times with minimal variation. Template cadence in the middle third: "He lifted…," "He read…," "He placed…," "He realized…" runs across multiple sentences. Figurative language clusters in descriptive beats rather than peak pressure moments, creating textural decoration without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Phrase repetition flattens momentum: "quietly explosive" appears twice, "spooled wholeness" three times, "dust-laden starlight" twice within the final third. Several sentences restate the same content—"empty spaces remember" is paraphrased across four beats without added pressure. Template cadence: "She lifted...She wrote...She whispered...She recorded...She lowered...She turned" creates mechanical rhythm. Mixed metaphor: "the void between clouds is a ledger of loss" conflates void, ledger, and emotional abstraction without coherent vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "secret book safe" appears seven times, often mid-sentence scaffolding; "fractally precise" recurs as decorative filler; "the hush," "silence," and "held breath" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "She stepped back... She completed... She smiled." Figurative language stacks without payoff: "sunrise trapped in timber," "cathedral of sky," "breath of sky" blur into generic lyricism. Deductions total −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy figurative layering ("sea of clouds," "living constellations," "chorus," "copper veins hidden beneath the deck," "silver threads that wrapped around the copper like vines") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops: "She believed that such a glow… could become a beacon" restates the prior setup without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" across contiguous lines. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("sociable isolation of lone scholars") that sits uneasily with the map-apprentice POV. Information density is low; many lines redescribe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative density is high and occasionally overwrites pressure: "coat frayed like old driftwood," "ink trembling like sea-foam," "gears...shimmering like frozen rain," "hands shivered, then aligned" stack metaphors in quick succession without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "The gears were silent, waiting" → "feeling the pulse of possibility rise" → "The words resonated, and the gears...clicked together" restates readiness across three beats. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates, but information density is low in the final third, where action is summarized rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.9)
    Sentence openings vary minimally; several paragraphs begin with "The" or "Liora/She." Figurative language clusters without pattern payoff: "brambled hope," "nebula of respite," "translucent perch" add texture but do not accelerate pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: the nebula's glow is described multiple times without new function. The bell's chime is "trembling like a heart beat" (cliché embodiment). No significant scaffolding, but density is low—many lines repeat mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting is pervasive: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff ("thin thread of frost," "bruised awe," "quiet river of silver light," "tapestry of sound"), triggering density and coherence penalties. Several mixed metaphors ("stone ribs bruised awe," "coil around her heart... scorched her nerves") violate physical logic. Template cadence runs appear in the middle third ("She began to turn... With each revolution... The humming resonated..."). Paraphrase loops cluster around the lullaby's effect (lines 24–26 restate seepage without added pressure). Combined artifacts and register drift in peak beats accumulate to −1.4, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is moderate, though several beats engage in synonym churn ("graceless beauty," "jagged elegance," "bitter sweetness") and paraphrase loops (the curse's persistence is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure). Stock metaphors—"wound that will never fully heal," "dying dragon"—dull specificity in peak beats. Template cadence appears in the mid-section with repetitive "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" openers across adjacent sentences. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff, and some metaphors clash (orchard as patient surgeon, then as sighing entity). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs, and −0.4 for mixed metaphors in closure proximity, totaling −1.0 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "empty chrysalis" repeats five times with minimal reweighting; "pieces fall into place" appears twice as metaphor and once as prompt element. Template cadence in the lab-return sequence: "She placed... Colleagues stared... They listened... Months later." Stock metaphors ("translucent bridge," "seed of a fresh composition") dull peak beats. Clarity is adequate, but information density is low—many lines restate prior material without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.1)
    Patterned overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the bottle-placement sequence layers figurative language ("pulsed like a shy sunrise," "glass skin catching the reflected sunrise of clouds," "liquid glow fracturing into shards," "scripts like fireflies awakening") without a taught pattern or payoff, triggering −0.5 for density and coherence (mixed metaphor: "shy sunrise" then "reflected sunrise"). Paraphrase loops appear ("to find the place where stories begin, a seed of origin"; "the place where stories begin is not a location but a moment") and template cadence runs through the middle third (repeated "The vendor [verb]" and "Each [noun] [verb]" stems), adding −0.6. The final-paragraph artifacts ("the library sang a single chord, a glimmering parole resonating through the clouds, announcing that a new story had been born") touch closure, escalating the deduction to −1.0 total. The Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits non-closure penalties to −0.8, but closure-touch artifacts add another −0.2, yielding a cumulative −1.0 penalty from a mid-5 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose exhibits template cadence and synonym churn throughout: "He knew," "He traced," "He inhaled," "He moved," "He tasted" create a monotonous rhythm that flattens momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("the cold was not just temperature but a carrier" restates earlier sensory claims), and several beats recycle the same conceptual ground—remorse as flavor, contagion through touch, collective guilt—without advancing pressure. Figurative density is high ("tiny droplets of brine," "soft sandstorm," "brittle resilience") but much of it ornamental rather than causal. The final paragraph stacks abstract declaratives ("humming with a brittle resilience, sturdy yet ready to fracture") that summarize rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "The weight, when dropped, would release a chime" / "When the first note rang"; "interspersed languages" appears three times in near-identical phrasing; "bridges" and "silos" recur in synonym chains ("planks," "pathways," "towering silos," "empty husks"). Template cadence dominates the middle: "She [verb]…The [noun] [verb]…Workers [verb]…" Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "captured in amber," "tapestry of sound," "incense from the silos," "tender vigor." Register drifts into abstraction ("empathetically decisive," "vigorous tenderness") that flattens the voice. Elevated diction pervades peak beats, obscuring causality and dulling the closure image. Artifacts touch the final third, triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the calibration and projection sequence stacks metaphor or elevated diction without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.6). Mixed metaphors appear ("moonlight spilling…like liquid quartz," "heart quaked with reverie") and register drifts into abstract academic lexicon ("synaptic plasticity," "entangled memories," "chaotically precise") outside a plausible POV filter. Template cadence is evident in repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across adjacent lines. Paraphrase loops occur: "Each shard became a neuron, each fissure a synapse" restates the synaptic-plasticity conceit already introduced two paragraphs earlier. Cumulatively, these artifacts dull immediacy and obscure the closure image (−1.4 total in Q7), disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact-in-final-third rule.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dense figurative language pervades every beat without pattern-teaching or payoff: "seeds of vigilance sprouting tiny phosphorescent points," "latent blaze stir within her," "cipher lattice of interlocking symbols," "clandestinely luminous." Mixed metaphors abound—vigilance as seeds, fire as blaze, knowledge as prism refraction—without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops recur: "the marginal doodle flared, revealing a hidden cipher" / "the cipher was a lattice"; "the glyph pulsed once, then dissolved into falling sparks" / "the sparks settled… sprouting tiny seedlings." Template cadence dominates: "She slipped… and set out," "She inhaled… then stepped through," "She placed… She understood… She whispered." Filter verbs cluster: "She felt," "She recognized," "She understood." Applying artifact penalties: dense figurative muddle −0.7, paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, filter-verb stack −0.3; total −1.9 routed to Q7 only. Artifacts appear in the closure paragraph ("She understood that vigilance… must be tended"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence weaken line-level craft. "The porcelain insulator resonated… its surface humming faintly, as if absorbing… and returning it" restates the same idea across two clauses. Runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" structures create rhythmic monotony. Stock phrases ("living archive," "hushed promise," "shared breath") accumulate without specificity, and several key beats ("empathy in motion," "symphonically minded") repeat as labels rather than embodied images. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the tree-song sculptor taught"), triggering elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase-loop penalty (−0.6): multiple adjacent sentences restate without added pressure—e.g., paragraphs 10–11 cycle through "eclipsed covenant was not broken/paused," "hidden pattern/beauty," "hopeful melancholy" as synonyms. Template-cadence penalty (−0.5): "He [verb]" stems and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions dominate (twelve instances in final third). Stock metaphor strings ("wan flag," "compass," "canvas," "beacon," "bridge," "brushstrokes") accumulate without fresh grounding. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("felt," "realized," "knew," "recalled") dull immediacy, adding −0.5 and disallowing 9+ globally. Figurative density (metaphor in most sentences of the final third) without taught pattern applies −0.4. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph repeats "hopeful melancholy" three times), escalating cumulative penalty to −1.7 within Q7 and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language ("ripples of copper, lavender, and old parchment," "midnight roses," "lanterns guiding lost travelers") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.6). Paraphrase loops abound: "the path to empathy" is restated three times in variant phrasing, and "theatrical sincerity" bookends without added meaning. Template cadence dominates the middle section ("He whispered…and the ink blossomed," "He understood then," "He stepped…He bowed…He whispered"), applying an additional −0.5. Scaffold phrases ("the first step toward," "a collective breath released") and synonym churn ("hush," "quiet," "silence," "stillness") dull momentum. Information density is low; most sentences ornament rather than advance stakes or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "undercurrent of wisdom" appears five times, "olfactorily sensitive" three times, "wildflower hush" four times, each with near-identical framing. Runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" create drumbeat rhythm. Mixed metaphors ("breath is a step," "tide's thought") muddle clarity. Figurative density in every beat without pattern payoff triggers −0.7; template cadence and loops add −1.0. Artifacts pervade and touch the ending, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence openings vary adequately; rhythm modulates between longer descriptive passages and shorter action beats. Minor loop: paragraphs 8 and 9 both open with "Below" and "She lowered" / "As the probe," creating slight redundancy. Figurative density is high ("like translucent coral," "like kelp," "like quiet balloons," "like emerald fire") across multiple beats without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure. Register occasionally elevates ("the whirling silence," "verdant canopy," "phosphorescence") in proximity to simple action verbs. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty (setting + mood) but others lean ornamental. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting severity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is largely clean with varied sentence rhythm and purposeful imagery ("wind...sounded like distant traffic"). However, repetitive scaffolding appears: "Mara [verb]" openings cluster in adjacent sentences, and paraphrase loops thin density ("The containers shivered...spiraling around the central tower like a ghostly vortex. It was as if the singular convergence folded onto itself"). The final paragraph stacks summary ("she had ensured...measured, understood, and guided") where a single image would sharpen closure. Minor template cadence lowers momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "sculpted hush" appears four times with near-identical phrasing; "oscillating repose" is repeated without evolving function; "through the colors of the aurora" recurs as scaffolding. Template cadence in the final third ("She imagined… She turned… her bells still ringing") flattens momentum. Mixed metaphors: sound "painted the frozen walls" and "split into rainbow chords" without coherent vehicle. Register drift into essay-like abstraction ("continuum," "vessel for the aurora's hues") during peak beats. Applying −1.4 for spread artifacts and −0.3 for final-third template cadence; cap disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "canyon hush" recurs seven times with minor variation; "avalanchingly quiet" and "hush" are restated adjacently without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She [verb]… She [verb]…") appear across multiple paragraphs. Several metaphors are mixed or abstract ("breath was avalanchingly quiet," "weaving of worlds," "tapestry of echoes"). Information density is moderate; beats advance but scaffold phrases ("she felt," "she knew," "she understood") dull immediacy. Final-paragraph repetition of "canyon hush" and "quiet" weakens the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("topaz walls…pulse with a faint, violet hue," "vanishing stars…dimmed to pinpricks"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "borrowed personalities" and "transposed empathy" are restated across multiple sentences without added pressure, and "she believed" / "she realized" / "she felt" stems recur. Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing propulsion in peak beats. No major clarity breaks, but scaffold phrasing ("a reminder that," "as if") and synonym churn ("shimmered," "whispered," "murmured") dull momentum. The final third remains vivid but does not tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear frequently: "vibration synced with pulse" → "pulse of objects"; "tiny miracle" → "spark of wonder"; "germinate curiosity" → "seed of myth" → "stories to germinate." Template cadence runs across multiple sentences ("He believed... He stopped... He lifted... He continued... He remembered... He felt... He recalled... He vanished"). Stock metaphors (sunrise-kissed leaves, night flowers, liquid glass) cluster without fresh synthesis. Figurative density is high but coherence slips (pendant "hums a song" then "maps currents"). Apply −0.8 for loops/stems, −0.4 for mixed metaphors, total ~−1.2 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "dawn slipped through," "air hummed with a shifted hush," "frost bloomed into luminous veins," "heart…opened like a blossom." Mixed metaphors accumulate—frost as veins, emotions as sponges/steam, truth as lie—without coherent vehicle logic, triggering density and coherence penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "emotions did not merely pass through objects; they settled, colored, and altered them" restates the hypothesis already conveyed. Template cadence runs in the opening third (multiple "The [noun] [verbed]" stems). Several beats rely on filter verbs and abstraction ("felt a pulse of grief," "knew the discovery would ripple") that dull immediacy. The closure paragraph includes scaffold summary ("She walked away…carrying the truth") rather than propulsive image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting flattens momentum: "stoically sparkling" appears three times as a decorative tag; "raveling silence" is recycled without reweighting; metaphors stack without coherence ("loom of absence," "threads that whispered of stories yet unspun," "time's unraveling tapestry"). Paraphrase loops abound: the bead's light "expanded, flooding the orchard like sunrise" is immediately followed by "The light formed a thin filament…winding upward," restating the same visual. Template cadence appears in the middle section ("She placed…she rummaged…she realized…each subsequent puzzle piece clicked"). The final paragraph contains a thematic summary ("sacrifice…would always be the loom of tomorrow") that tells rather than showing the closure image, dulling the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "each strike a promise" / "each edge a promise" / "each pulse a reminder of the promise"; "quietly determined" and "deliberate" recur without variation. Template cadence dominates ("He listened... He resolved... He set out... He followed... He reached out..."). Stock metaphors cluster: "twin horizon of hope and doubt," "bartered awakenings," "coax resilience from rubble" (x3). Figurative density in every sentence ("fields...glittering," "market like sighs," "shafts yawned like dark arteries," "draped like a comet," "sang when lifted") without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final third repeats "azure defiance" and cognates four times in five sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "sensory maps" appear in six sentences with near-identical phrasing; "green shard" and "cyclically spontaneous" recur as labels without syntactic variation. Template cadence is pervasive—runs of "I [verb]…, and I [verb]…, and the [noun] [verb]" span the middle third without taught pattern. Stock metaphors ("rivers of light," "pearls in a glass bottle," "stars across…tapestry") cluster in peak beats, lowering density. Filter-verb stacks ("I felt," "I sensed," "I whispered") dull immediacy. Combined artifact load: paraphrase −0.3, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor run −0.4, filter stack −0.3 = baseline −1.5 in Q7; artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), adding −0.2 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: multiple sentences restate Marek's protective intent ("protect this fragile chain," "a promise that...would endure," "his vow to protect") without adding pressure. Stock metaphors cluster ("trapped sunrise," "tide pulling him toward home"). Template cadence appears in runs of similar stems ("He placed...He pressed...He added"). The final third stacks these patterns heavily, flattening momentum and disallowing high-band entry. Figurative language often obscures rather than sharpens ("luminescent ache of memory").

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear throughout: "green stone walls humming" and "green walls humming a chorus of renewal" restate without pressure; "the lighthouse beam" is repeated in template cadence across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("living serpent of light," "chorus of silver syllables") pile up without clarity, and the prism mechanics—"total internal reflection"—are named but never shown in concrete action. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "felt") dull immediacy in key beats. Information density is low; many lines offer color without advancing causality or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.7)
    Template cadence dominates: nearly every sentence follows "She [verb]" or "[Object] [past-tense stative verb]" structure, creating drumbeat monotony. Paraphrase loops abound—"iridescent caution" and "quietly explosive" each appear 3+ times without functional variation. Heavy stacks of figurative language ("ribbons of light that danced through the mist," "moonlight loom," "cascade of light") obscure concrete action. The loom beat summarizes the climax ("she whispered the ancient words… the loom sang") rather than dramatizing it. Synonym churn for "light" (glow, trails, flared, illuminated, spiraled, cascade) substitutes for propulsion. Information density is low; most sentences redecorate prior claims.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the sextant could help him map scattered dreams" / "began to trace the faint outlines of dreams"; "quantified sorrow" appears six times without variation; "moonlight" and derivatives recur fifteen times. Template cadence: "He [verb]" anchors most beats with scaffold transitions ("As the moon rose," "When the last strand dissolved," "As he stepped into the night"). Mixed metaphor: the grid is "a lattice of sorrow" yet also hums and releases filaments like data threads. Figurative density in the final third ("the tower seemed to inhale," "moon's gentle smile") obscures causal clarity (−1.2).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "knits communities together" appears verbatim three times; "woven dawns" recurs in identical phrasing across eight lines without variation or added pressure. Template cadence dominates: "The orchard… began to emit," "The ribbons seeped," "The mirror world… began to pulse." Figurative density is unrelenting—"ribbons of light," "chorus of sunrise fragments," "tapestry of twilight"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring concrete action. The closure beat ("permanent sunrise," "never again surrender") is abstract assertion rather than image. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, figurative muddle −0.5; total artifact debt −1.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and stock metaphors. "Compassionate recluse," "keenly empathetic," "enlarged tranquility" recur as labels without varied embodiment. Template cadence is pervasive: "He [verb], [gerund clause]" structures dominate (e.g., "He lifted the attic hatch, feeling the weight of centuries…"). Mixed metaphors muddle sense: "the world humming with hidden dialogues" followed by "the pull of those nested paradoxes like a tide." The mirror's whisper—"to hide it was to deny the very heart that sought love"—reads as elevated abstraction disconnected from the POV's concrete experience. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without causal work, creating density without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "creeping normality noticer" appears three times, "tenuous absolution" four times, "heuristically gentle" twice, "uncloak" three times, and "after the birds fly south" twice, all without reweighting (−0.8). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with participial phrases ("feeling," "carrying," "whispering") or "The + noun" constructions across the final third (−0.5). Stock metaphors—"time seemed to uncloak itself like a shy guest," "vines curled tighter," "the world tilt toward the ordinary"—blur rather than sharpen sense (−0.4). High information density is absent; many lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without escalation or pattern-teaching: "pillars of ice," "quartz hush," "sheet of bruised violet," "crystal veil," "filament of story," "needles of revelation," "constellation of luminous vows" appear in rapid succession without clear payoff at closure. Mixed metaphor: vows are "filaments" that "stretch across the vaulted ceiling" yet also form a "map" and later a "constellation"—three incompatible spatial metaphors for the same phenomenon. Template cadence in the middle third: "She understood... She placed... She lowered... She closed... She stepped... She whispered" stacks identical sentence stems. Paraphrase loop: "quartz hush" recurs six times with near-synonym "silence" and "quiet" without added meaning. Apply −1.2 cumulative for density without payoff, mixed metaphor, and template stems; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.7)
    Line-level clarity is adequate, but overwriting clusters in several beats: "the comforting unease that settled like a soft blanket," "a pulse echoing the fading night," and "the truce of hush would still hold only until sunrise" recur with synonym churn and template cadence ("the truce of hush" appears four times). The watch fob's state is paraphrased across adjacent lines—"warm," "cold," "warm against her chest"—without added pressure. Figurative density is high in the final third ("metronome," "pulse," "blanket," "seed of future conflict") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5 for overwriting and −0.3 for loops, totaling −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is clear and vivid with strong rhythm variation, but several artifact clusters lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("The ring was not a map but an emergent compass, learning the lay of paths" restated as "emergent compass flickered, its circuits humming as if recognizing a pattern"), synonym churn for "emergent compass" and "terrestrially cosmic" without pressure payoff, and template cadence in the middle stretch ("He pressed...letting...The emergent compass flickered...As more participants tasted...The ring began to map"). Figurative density is high throughout ("whispered of forgotten futures," "scent curled like soft binary code," "holo-journal halos") without pattern-teaching or a payoff that constrains choice, crossing into overwriting per the Density check (−0.5 in Q7). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack baseline (−0.8). No filter-verb stacks or closure-beat contamination, so the 9+ global disallow does not apply, but high-band entry is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("frozen starlight," "mournful beauty," "swirling light," "bright filament," "aurora that stretched"), creating density without propulsion; peak beats (lock opening, ink emergence) receive the same textural weight as exposition, dulling momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "The lock's shards reflected fractured rainbows" echoes "broken combination lock dangling like a lost promise" without adding pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]." Clarity holds, but information density is low—many lines restate atmosphere rather than advancing choice or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense and consistent ("wilted courtyard," "breathing misty sighs," "words settle in the air") without mixed metaphors, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly from workshop to archive to cavern to vent. Sentence openings vary adequately, preventing template monotony. However, several beats loop conceptually: "She believed... She felt... She realized... She understood" recur as stems that restate theme rather than advance pressure. The phrase "lost conversations" appears six times without meaningful variation. Information density is moderate—many lines do atmospheric work but few do double duty advancing both character and plot. No major artifacts obscure closure, capping deductions at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.3)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "glisten" recurs eight times, "muted" / "seasonally mute" five times, "symphonies of truth" four times, "color of wonder" four times, often in adjacent or nearby sentences without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate—"He works... His motivation... He knows... He walks"—creating syntactic monotony (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("sunrise kisses the sky," "world senses a quiet triumph") and therapy-speak labels ("muted vigor," "quiet triumph") flatten immediacy in key beats (−0.4). Scaffold sentences restate content: "The tuner smiles, feeling the muted vigor of his craft pulse through his fingertips" immediately follows "the copper arm casts long shadows... turning silence into a visual chorus" without causal advance. High figurative density in peak beats without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.5. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("Thus hope glistens"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping this category at 8.8 (though the base score remains well below that threshold). Total artifact deduction: −1.7 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The box inhaled, its bark tightening, and a quiet hiss announced the containment" restates the miniaturization already described. Template cadence runs through the ending: "She realized… She tucked… She recorded… She stood." Figurative density is high without clear pattern payoff: "symbols that pulsed faintly," "chaos humming in synchrony," "fractured glass" stars. Prompt-element labels recur as fill rather than pressure: "miniaturize," "controlled burn escape," "fragmented wholeness." These artifacts dull momentum and obscure whether actions have cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "sandstorm calm" recurs five times without reweighting; "locked mailbox mystery," "aged locket," "neighborhood storytelling" repeat as labels rather than evolving images. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "whisper grew louder, forming a melody" / "each note she heard whispered a name." Mixed metaphor: "the locket led through following hidden paths" conflates direction and pursuit illogically. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to echo") dull immediacy in key beats. The phrase "leads through following" appears twice as scaffolding without clear sense.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template phrasing proliferate: "Each pirouette encrypted… each note a key… each entry sang… each movement a line of code… each breath a cipher." Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff—"sea-foam," "spider spins its web," "phoenix," "shared cipher"—creating density without information advance. Repeated scaffold phrases ("calm defiance" appears three times, "hangman's dice" five times, "quiet rebellion" twice) and synonym churn ("whispered," "hummed," "echoing") dull momentum. The closure beat is cluttered with metaphor stacks that obscure rather than sharpen the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "deleted memories were not lost, merely compressed" restates the premise three times across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" dominate sentence openings. Stock metaphors ("minnows in a moonlit tide," "sifted dreams," "gentle hands") appear in most lines without fresh specificity. Mixed metaphor: gravity pockets "pulse like a heartbeat" yet also "sing in steady, measured notes." Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing action or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.4)
    Dense metaphor and synonym churn pervade: "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "mapping silence," "terrestrially cosmic" are repeated or paraphrased without new pressure. Template cadence dominates ("She whispered… She felt… She placed… She rose…"). Figurative language in nearly every sentence ("molten glass," "web of stars," "river of stars") blurs sense without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines (e.g., "hush settled… unfurled… spreading") and stock phrases ("destiny itself," "peace and hidden power") flatten momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("tranquil blaze within her would keep the smoothed hush alive").

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: the "agreed upon lies" concept is restated at least four times without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence runs through the final third with parallel "each [X]" constructions that mechanically cycle without propulsion. The figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure moments ("meteor-lit night would be a lesson, each borrowed spoon of sugar a promise") without pattern-teaching, reducing clarity. Information density is low—many sentences restate the meeting's atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.3)
    Heavy overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor ("draped in deep violet velvet," "tragically radiant pulse," "ghostly resolve"), creating rhythmic monotony and density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops abound—"archive of quarantined memory," "cataloguing echoes through resonance structures," "library of sighs" all restate the same abstraction. Template cadence dominates: "The seashell… its whispers… each note…" in parallel structures. Stock metaphors (roses as "pale hands," morning as "promise") cluster in peak beats, reducing clarity. Sentence openings recycle ("She pressed," "She recorded," "She lifted," "She walked"), flattening momentum. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("a tragically radiant reminder that every ending is merely…"), disallowing 9+ globally per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "to forgive the unfinished" / "offering forgiveness to the unfinished," "calibrated treason" (three times), "key with no apparent lock" (four times), and "wisely enduring" / "wisely / enduring" recur without added detail. Template cadence appears in mid-section runs: "She understood… She chose… She traced… She whispered… She stepped… She bowed… She tucked." Stock metaphors—"tapestry of forgiveness," "hymn of hope," "doors of memory"—flatten key beats. These artifacts cluster across the piece, including the closure paragraph, triggering the Q7 artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally. Deduction: −1.7 for spread touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "wistful sigh" / "melancholy," "echo" / "reverberations" / "lingering," "webs of intrigue" mentioned three times without functional variation. Template cadence dominates mid-story with identical "She [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Stock metaphors abound—"lone reed," "threads drawing her," "dormant fireflies"—without fresh synthesis, and figurative density in the cavern sequence (lattice, threads, void, hymn) blurs rather than sharpens the image. The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("promised," "descended," "emerged," "walked") that rehearse rather than advance closure, violating the paragraph-cut test. Apply −1.2 for spread artifacts and cap at mid-4s.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "expose the hidden purity" / "release the pure essence" / "seed of purity yearning for light" / "the pure thing she salvaged" recycle the same concept across four beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in parallel "she + [verb]" stems: "She had learned," "She achieved," "She mapped," "She whispered," "She traced," "She stepped," "She whispered," "She realized," "She rose"—nine instances creating monotonous rhythm. Metaphor muddle: "window of connection" is introduced as portal, then lattice, then translucent vapor window, mixing vehicles without coherent physical logic (−0.5). Stock mystical phrases—"borrowed starlight," "dream-tide," "moon-lit water"—appear in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff (density penalty −0.4). Applying Patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 for loops and template cadence; artifacts touch the closure beat ("pulsed brighter," "illuminate countless other shattered dreams"), escalating to −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally, capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.7)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting throughout ("net of thoughts," "hesitant punctuation marks," "invisible nets of life"). Paraphrase loops abound: paragraphs restate "hidden patterns" and "moon paths" without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate: "He lifted...felt...raised...followed...placed...began...walked." The final third repeats the opening thesis with synonym churn, artifacts touching closure. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the hidden patterns settle") dull immediacy in peak beats. Line-level clarity suffers under decorative density.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the same content: "sharply observant conspiracy debunker" is echoed by "excavate truth from comfortable lies" and "sharp observation"; "the cursed legend was a smokescreen" paraphrases "comfortable lie set by the corporation to hide the stillpoint." Stock metaphors abound: "wounded star," "beacon of clarity amid chaos," "truth could bloom." Runs of identical stems ("She collected," "She knew," "She followed," "She placed," "She understood," "She documented," "She left," "She shared," "She whispered") create mechanical rhythm across the final third. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a pulse," "felt the weight," "felt the radiation") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Each night, the lonely visionary would arrange… When the lightning converged… Night after night, the coils hummed…" recycles structure without adding pressure. Stacked filter constructions and elevated register ("the air hummed with fragmented radio frequencies," "the observatory's brass telescopes turned inward, mapping the pulse of hope") obscure rather than propel. Mixed metaphors appear ("mirrors sang," "ancient shadows wielded as lanterns," "hearts throbbed with hopeful cadence"). Stock phrasing ("the storm feel like a drumroll," "promised a covenant") and synonym churn ("stormlit," "fragmented," "lyrically prophetic" repeated without reweighting) trigger cumulative −0.6 to −1.4 in Q7 per the artifact pack. At least three template-stem runs and one paraphrase loop are present, touching the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.9)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but scaffold and paraphrase loops recur: "sweetened" appears three times in similar constructions, "redemption" echoes across multiple beats without added pressure, and the final third repeats "the vagrant penny poet" and thematic phrases ("translator," "bridge," "chorus"). Filter-verb reliance ("felt," "seemed," "believed") in reflective beats dulls immediacy (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "dust motes…dance like tiny planets" conflates scale incoherently. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting and figurative density obscure rather than propel: "the sea whispered," "golden limbs stretched," "eerie shadows that danced like ghosts of forgotten songs," "breathing life into the cold." Mixed metaphors (the sunset has "limbs" that "stretched and retreated") and stock phrasing ("tear slip down her cheek," "a little less fractured") accumulate without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "the world seemed a little less fractured" / "a perfect symphony" restate satisfaction without adding pressure. Template cadence in the middle: multiple sentences open "She [verb]" in sequence. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering −1.7 penalty in Q7 per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "patient revolution," "slow uprising of patience," "softly purposeful," "restrained wildness" recur without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence dominates ("She moved… She recorded… She realized… She turned… She paused… She felt…"), with adjacent sentences restating the same content (e.g., "a patient revolution" / "a slow uprising of patience" / "sculpt patience from impatience"). Stock metaphors ("quiet promise," "silver veins," "dark as obsidian") and filter-verb stacks in peak beats trigger −0.9. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("unyoke the rush, honor the still"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose carries significant pattern debt: "entangled memories," "reverberate/reverberating" (used five times), "controlling influence" (three times), and "fortified vulnerability" recur without evolution, creating synonym loops and conceptual redundancy. Template cadence appears in strings like "I felt… I recalled… I placed… I noted… I traced… I turned." Many sentences restate content—e.g., the tunnel's "low thrum" and "stories reverberate" are paraphrased across adjacent lines. Figurative density is high without always advancing sense ("droplets clung… like memories," "shadows… reminded me of the past's lingering grip"). These artifacts pervade non-closure beats, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack baseline and capping high-band entry per the artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "vibrant hush" appears three times with identical phrasing; "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" recurs verbatim as scaffold. Template cadence in early beats: "He had come seeking... The shopkeeper... welcomed... She explained... The chaplain listened..." Figurative language is dense but often mixed or stock: "coat bore the weight of iron bars," "air held its breath," "eyes reflecting amber glow... seemed to pulse." Several beats restate prior content without adding pressure (e.g., the apology is promised, whispered, then said to pulse through metal). Information density is low in reflective stretches; momentum stalls in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"rebellious kite," "poet reading a love letter written in glass," "sarcastic philosophers," "absurdly jubilant rainbow"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating ornamental layering that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops surface: "the yearning algorithm…insisted," "the algorithm's quiet desperation," "the yearning algorithm pulse," "the yearning algorithm, still steadily curious" recycle the same concept across beats. Template cadence in the final third: "The gears cheered, the acid sea simmered, and the yearning algorithm…recorded" stacks parallel clauses mechanically. Clarity remains legible but propulsion sags under decorative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is adequate; information advances each beat without major loops. However, template cadence appears in runs of "She [verb]" constructions and stock metaphors ("forgotten corners," "fading chorus," "digital afterlife") that read as placeholder texture. The phrase "brightly attentive" is asserted without embodiment, and several lines paraphrase the same content: "she found a dusty terminal displaying a cascade of the numbers" is immediately followed by "each line ending with a file path that vanished." Figurative language ("phantom breadcrumb," "looping video," "singing the echo") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, pushing toward ornamental density. No major causality breaks, so deductions remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "fragment's rhythm matched the breath of the lighthouse" and "lighthouse's beam turned gentle, wrapping the scene in warmth" restate resonance without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She recalled... She slipped... She placed... She watched... She felt"). Stock metaphors ("like water," "like snow on a quiet night") and elevated diction ("reconstitute lost wholeness," "sync with the sea's pulse") clash with embodied immediacy. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("fold in patience," "grip on reality loosely," "choir of surrender," "pages turning in a book that had long been closed"), risking overwriting without pattern-taught payoff—most metaphors illustrate rather than constrain or charge closure. Paraphrase loops appear: "the fold in patience was not a crack but a gentle bend" recaps prior imagery without added pressure. Template cadence runs in reflective passages (e.g., "I realized…," "I understood…," "I felt…"). Stock metaphors (flower opening, stone dropped in water) dilute specificity. Clarity remains serviceable, but momentum sags under ornamental phrasing, especially in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.2)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: the sentinel's act of drawing parallels is restated across paragraphs two, eight, and fourteen with synonym churn but no added pressure. Template cadence: "By drawing parallels…" opens three sentences, "gently persuasive" recurs without variation. Stock metaphors ("amber light seem like liquid memory") and elevated diction in every sentence create density without propulsion. Figurative language saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.7. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("mismatched destinies could converge"), disallowing 9+ globally and adding −1.7 total in Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm is lyric and controlled, but syntactic variety is limited: many sentences open with "The" or "He" and follow subject-verb-object patterns without modulation. Paraphrase loops appear ("echo of wisdom" recurs six times; "peripheral awareness" appears four times without evolving meaning). Stock metaphors accumulate: "sea of grain," "secret tide," "fragile fire," "dew on his inner landscape." Information density is low; beats often restate atmosphere without advancing situation. The final paragraph stacks three sentences beginning with participial phrases, creating template cadence. No clarity breaks occur, but propulsion sags under decorative repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She decided to linger… to linger in this fragrant cradle"; "collective healing… collective pulse… collective heartbeat"; "the archivist's purpose… the archivist promised… the subtle puzzle archivist's steady hands." Multiple sentences restate the same concept without added pressure. Register drifts into abstract therapy-speak ("emotional terrain," "shared recollection was already mending wounded spirits") inconsistent with Mara's grounded voice. Mixed metaphors (vines "feeding the story with fresh memory," light "dusting" faces) reduce clarity. High density of stacked modifiers and stock imagery ("tears fell like dew, yet smiles blossomed") flattens propulsion. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−0.8) and template-cadence deduction (−0.5); cap disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "suspended hush" appears five times with minimal reweighting; "fractured sequences" and "weathered innocence" recur as labels without evolving function. Template cadence: "She [verb]...she [verb]" runs across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphor: light cannot "scatter sonically" (contradictory vehicle). Register drift into academic abstraction ("lexical," "sonorous gift," "testimony") clashes with scene immediacy. Line-level debt disallows 9+ globally and triggers artifact penalties of −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is vivid (fog, driftwood, cassette, monolith). However, metaphor density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or a payoff that charges closure: nearly every sentence in the garden sequence deploys figurative language ("mist-laden paths," "taste like half-remembered songs," "pulse of a tide that never ceased," "moonlit wave that drags shells"). Some phrases loop conceptually ("echoes of his past selves" / "clinging to echoes," "tide of longing" recurs three times). The closing paragraphs recycle the tidal/echo motif without tightening, and the final image—chalk dust, ghost-ship horn, garden's mist sighing—feels textured but not propulsive. Clarity remains intact; no grammar or tense errors. Deductions for density without escalation and minor looping.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "luminous ache" appears six times with synonym variants ("radiant sigh," "bittersweet glow") that restate mood without adding pressure; multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "He [verb]" in runs of three or more. Mixed metaphors: the clock hand is both "a filament of starlight" and mounted on a "brass cradle," and "escape velocity" conflates astronomical threshold with metaphorical yearning incoherently. Figurative density in most sentences (silvered arches, luminous ache, song of gears, dance of light) without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.6 for density, plus −0.5 for paraphrase loops and −0.4 for template cadence, totaling approximately −1.5 cumulative deduction in Q7, with an additional −0.2 for these artifacts touching the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: the "radiant haven above the clouds" is named four times with minimal variation; "pulsing stillness" appears twice in identical phrasing; "scent of hope" recurs as a label without fresh detail. Template cadence runs appear in the opening third ("She moved… each step… a method she called…" ; "She placed… and whispered…"). Stock metaphors cluster without coherent vehicle logic: "dew on her shoulders," "kite catching the first wind of dawn," "hymn of love that would never truly end." Register drifts into corporate abstraction ("coalesce," "accommodate an orderly goodbye," "execute a flawless goodbye") that clashes with a music therapist's interior lexicon. These artifacts appear throughout, including the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; no orientation or sequence confusion. Sentence openings show variety, and paragraph rhythm supports the accumulative design. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The key's purpose, then, was to bridge the loop…" immediately follows "She realized that the shadows at noon were not merely absence of light…"; both lines restate the same revelation. Template cadence emerges in the final third: "She whispered… She pressed… She catalogued… She stepped back… Lira smiled." Stock phrasing recurs: "quietly deliberate" (twice), "sealed awakenings" (five times), "closing loops" (four times). Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance pressure. No figurative muddle or factual error, but the prose leans on scaffold and recycled stems where tighter compression would serve momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence in the repair sequence carries figurative language ("marrow stitching a new map," "click resonated like a note," "lattice of vines...glowing points"), violating density without pattern-teaching (−0.6). Multiple paraphrase loops: "cleft in certainty" / "cleft echoing doubt" / "cleft narrowing" and "shrewdly innocent" repeated three times without added meaning (−0.4). Template cadence in the middle third ("She knelt...feeling," "She whispered...recalling," "She recalled...") flattens rhythm (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("symphony," "constellations," "embryonic galaxy") cluster without fresh specificity. Combined artifact penalties total approximately −1.5; artifacts touch the closure image ("garden glimmered"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn dull momentum: "reflectively vibrant" appears three times, "pearl of stillness" recurs without added pressure, and multiple sentences restate that the glass reflects the pearl's glow. Template cadence dominates ("She lifted… She placed… She whispered…"). Figurative density ("serpentine," "emerald serpents," "breath of wind," "zephyr bloom," "tiny lantern," "morning dew," "distant galaxies," "luminous chords") saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, applying the full deduction range and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops. Multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" across paragraphs ("The wind whispered," "The pendant warmed," "The code unfurled," "The garden thrummed," "The story of that night"). Figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching: "cathedral of rusted racks," "soft current," "cautious arms," "gentle lullabies," "luminous hush" all appear in high-pressure beats, muddling clarity. Synonym churn recycles "honeyed hush" and its variants without functional pressure. Scaffold appears in transition lines ("Guided by that scent," "Word of the transformation spread") that exist only to move the plot. Apply −1.4 for combined artifacts (template stems, figurative density, loops). The final third is touched, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences: "swirling hush" appears three times, "pulse/pulsed" five times, "lucidly watchful" twice, each without added pressure. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" structures run throughout without variation. Stock metaphors abound ("doubt gnawed," "mist curling like applause," "constellations on a dark sea"). Mixed register: "solemnize" (archaic/formal) clashes with "feral nexus" (contemporary metaphor). These artifacts pervade the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally and applying −1.4 in Q7 for spread plus closure contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.7)
    Template cadence is pervasive: "She had come…she sought…she believed…she knew…she realized…she felt…she whispered" runs through the piece with minimal syntactic variation, dulling propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("the remedy required more than mere tinkering; it demanded…" followed by "the remedy was not a potion but a reenactment") and figurative language stacks without causal work ("coaxing…spiraling…spinning…wrapping…bathed…settled"). The final third summarizes rather than dramatizes the children's learning and Mara's return, flattening momentum. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering a −0.8 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "Each discarded shard she arranged in spirals" / "The pattern grew slowly, each placement a careful breath"; "safekept starlight" appears seven times without variation; "moving stillness" recurs as a motif but also as filler. Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" openings dominate the middle third without purposeful rhythm. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh grounding: "lighthouse," "beacon," "pulse," "cartography of love and loss." Register drift into abstract poetic diction ("covenant," "reverent echo," "tableau of patient reverence") clashes with the concrete task of arranging debris. Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats (light settling, seal forming) without clear payoff, triggering density and coherence penalties. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("moving stillness settle like snowfall"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "reflective locksmith" is restated as "The locksmith's mind, always reflective," and "echo-harvest" recurs in summary without new pressure. Template cadence runs dominate mid-story ("He then spent hours studying… Each observation became… He fashioned… When he inserted…"), reducing propulsion. Elevated metaphors ("chorus of whispers," "tide of whispers," "library," "chorus of stored wonder") stack without coherent vehicle, triggering density and register penalties. The final two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize, dulling the closure image with exposition ("a lesson in listening").

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative density is extreme: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (lamp alignment, weight absorption, final flare) carries metaphor or elevated diction ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped," "midnight beads," "kelp in a tide"), obscuring propulsion and creating register drift. Paraphrase loops appear: "the shingled hush settled" recurs in varied forms without advancing situation. Template cadence is visible in repeated "She [verb]" openers and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. Information density is low—many lines do two jobs (describe and assert mood) but few advance causality or narrow options. The overwriting in the closure beat (final two paragraphs) lowers clarity and disallows 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "the rain-beaded skylight" / "rain beads slid down the skylight," "each stroke a measured negotiation" / "every loss can be shaped," "loss can be a tool" / "grief...could become a quiet beacon." Template cadence dominates action beats: "She set... She began... She coaxed... She placed... She lifted... She paused... She lifted again" creates monotonous stems across fifteen sentences. Stock metaphors ("steam traced silver veins," "shadows that dance like the memory of a lion's mane") and elevated diction ("marked time that seemed crystallized," "vessel that could contain love") drift into purple without grounding specificity. Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the carving sequence (lines ~7–12) obscures concrete action. Apply −1.2 for pervasive template cadence and loop/scaffold artifacts across the text, including in the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "fractured stillness" recurs without evolving, "eroded ambitions" appears three times as label, "regret" cycles through adjacent lines. Template cadence dominates ("She gathered," "She noted," "She whispered"). Metaphors stack without coherence ("metallic heart," "kinetic churn," "golden ribbons"). The final third doubles down on abstractions ("eternal twilight," "forgotten wheels") that obscure rather than propel. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the elevated penalty and global 9+ disqualification per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "resurrect hope" appears five times, "maze of intentions" four times, "functionally creative" twice, "stoic wonder" three times, creating synonym churn without accumulation. Template cadence runs dominate the middle: "She traced... She rerouted... She realized... She drafted... She recorded... She walked... She returned... She documented." Mixed metaphors muddle key beats: the sextant "becomes a compass for navigating ethical currents" conflates nautical tools incoherently, and "each decision... encoded like a mathematical promise" mixes code/promise/equation without clarifying any. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("functionally creative," "lattice of intention pathways," "rhythmic pulse of redirected flows") that clashes with on-page engineering action. Information density is low; many sentences restate her success without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.8)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: two near-identical sentences about imagining the clock on a rainy night appear back-to-back; "excruciatingly gentle" recurs across eight distinct beats without evolving meaning; "glacial hush" and "petrichor nostalgia" are invoked as stock atmosphere rather than earned through fresh detail. Template cadence runs (e.g., "He recalled… He realized… He reached… He imagined… He whispered… He felt… He closed… He whispered… The clock now stood…") across fifteen consecutive beats create mechanical propulsion. Multiple metaphors mix incoherently (crystal "exhales," bears as time-hands, dream as "bear of possibilities," crystal "breathing"). Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.6, stock metaphor strings −0.4 = baseline −1.6; artifacts touch closure beat (final paragraph repeats "excruciatingly gentle," "glacial hush," "petrichor") = −1.7 total, plus disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence dominates: "He felt...," "He realized...," "He whispered..." appear in adjacent beats without variation. Paraphrase loops recur—"architecture of lies" and "salvage" churn through synonym substitutes (unravel, crumble, set free) across multiple paragraphs without new pressure. Metaphors stack without coherent vehicle ("lies unravel," "crumble like sandcastles," "shining thoughtfully clear") and several contradict physics (a sundial tracing "the exact hour as if the sun were still present" in twilight). Stock phrases ("training instincts," "silence of morning radio") repeat as ornament. These artifacts pervade and touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language ("muted echo of distant tides," "ripple like water," "sleeping serpent"), creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("He felt infinitely patient" echoes the opening assertion; "oceanic hush" recurs four times with minimal reweighting). Template cadence runs: "He [verb]" structures dominate the middle third. Scaffold phrasing ("each knot a verse," "each visit offered new patterns") accumulates without advancing cause-effect. Final third artifacts (loops, metaphor stacks) disallow 9+ globally and trigger −1.4 in Q7 plus cross-cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.1)
    Line-level craft shows care—no typos, grammar is clean, sensory language is vivid—but pervasive overwriting and paraphrase loops dull momentum. Examples: "Each whisper was a vignette of a life paused" is immediately restated as "a vivid description of love left hanging"; "intimate projection" recurs three times; "geography of healing" appears five times without evolving meaning. Figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating decorative drag rather than propulsion. Template cadence in the final third ("He lifted… He wrote… He placed… He knew…") flattens rhythm. Apply −1.0 for loops and overwriting that obscure the closure image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "bitterly sweet" appears three times, "quaking reverie" recurs mechanically, and adjacent sentences restate the same idea ("The moment the egg cracked, a burst of feathered light erupted" / "From the fissure rose a phoenix-like creature"). Stock metaphors ("violin string about to snap," "silver tears") and elevated diction that drifts from the immediate action ("testament," "covenant," "metronome") reduce clarity. Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring the closure image. The final third is especially dense with abstraction and synonym churn, triggering the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "scars can sing" appears five times with minimal variation; "black sand" recurs in static descriptions across eight sentences. Template cadence dominates the opening and middle ("She carried… She planned… She fastened… She inhaled… She knelt…"), reducing propulsion. Figurative language is dense but often mixed or vague: "clouds of the seasonal migration" treats clouds as migrating entities, "water's cool breath mirror[s] the steady rhythm of her own pulse" stacks metaphor without coherence, and "quilted with moving clouds" contradicts the prior "liquid midnight" image. Stock phrases proliferate: "steady hands and brave hearts," "gentle brushstroke," "silent promise." The closure beat is dulled by summary ("carried the song of healed scars across the horizon") rather than concrete image. Apply −1.2 for combined loop, template-cadence, and stock-metaphor debt, plus −0.5 for artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is overwritten throughout: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (box opening, memory release) stacks metaphor without functional gain ("cascade of tiny lights...rose like fireflies...merged into a constellation...mirrored the migrating geese"). Figurative density in the climax obscures rather than sharpens the action. Paraphrase loops appear ("symbols...glowing," "glowing blue"; "forgotten fountains," "no longer forgotten but remembered"), and template cadence runs in multiple paragraphs ("She crouched...traced," "She placed...whispered," "She then followed...coaxed"). Sentence openings repeat ("The box," "The symbols," "The geese," "She...") without variation. These artifacts touch the closure beat and flatten momentum. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for pervasive pattern debt touching closure, disallow 9+ globally, and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.6)
    Runs of parallel structure dominate: "The gear pulsed… The garden itself breathed… The pulse traveled… Each echo returned… The glow was not flame… The sonar pinging grew louder…" Template cadence (subject-verb-object declaratives) pervades without taught purpose, triggering −0.6. Figurative density is high but coherence wobbles: "equations that approximates infinity" (number agreement error), "troubling serenity" repeated without reweighting. Paraphrase loops appear: "allow her to transit love" / "her transit had bridged the unseen." Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, adding −0.3 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("fiercely meditative river," "thundering calm," "flock of butterflies," "spectral figure," "river of color"), creating rhythmic beauty but obscuring sentence-level propulsion in peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "The ribbons, now unfurling like tiny flags, recorded each verse" and "the woven ribbon roll unwound more, its length becoming a river of color" restate the same image across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("Mara whispered," "Mara explained," "Mara's presence") and synonym churn surrounds "grief" (sorrow, mourning, aching heart). "Thundering calm" is a striking paradox but appears three times without evolving, reading as stock recurrence. The closing beat summarizes rather than showing Eliam's chisel at work, dulling the final image. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the weight," "felt Mara's presence") dull immediacy in high-pressure lines. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the disallow-9+ rule.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "incremental absolution" appears four times, "shared balance" thrice, "tiny inscriptions" / "inscriptions" nine times across adjacent beats without added meaning (−0.8). Template cadence runs: "She [verb]… She [verb]… She [verb]" in paragraphs 2, 11, 14 (−0.5). Register is elevated but repetitive; "searing reverie" and "ethically diligent" feel prompt-imported. Figurative language (obsidian "like ink," pendulum "like a bronze sentinel") is functional but stock. Momentum stalls in synonym churn ("fragment," "carving," "etching," "inscription") without propulsion. Artifacts touch multiple beats but not decisively the closure image, so baseline deductions apply in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: most sentences carry figurative language ("velveteen gloom," "quiet applause," "compass for future gardens") without pattern-teaching or pressure payoff, triggering −0.7 in Q7. Paraphrase loops appear ("uncharted echoes" recurs three times with minimal reweighting; "tenderly organized" and "blithe" are restated). Template cadence ("He felt," "He knew," "He traced") stacks in the middle third without variation. Clarity holds but density and propulsion are diluted by synonym churn and decorative phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from paraphrase loops (the cartographer's maps "had not only predicted obstacles but had also charted routes"; "the act of modeling had already inscribed outcomes") and template cadence ("He set up… he began to draw… he traced… he fed"). Stock metaphors proliferate: "dark needle," "laboratory of possibility," "silent promise," "bright horizon." Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content. The final third stacks summary rather than scene, and the closing image ("bright horizon of a transformed people") is a generic placeholder.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "shortwave radio dial glow" / "luminous dial" / "secretly luminous glow," "thistled calm" repeated without added pressure, "the cloak of the shawl" redundantly naming the same object. Template cadence runs appear: "She [verb]...she [verb]" structures stack without variation. Stock metaphors ("fireflies trapped in amber," "autumn leaves," "distant gulls over stormy seas") cluster in descriptive beats without fresh specificity. The phrase "secretly luminous" appears multiple times as a label without concrete action tied to its properties. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 in Q7 for loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy overwriting pervades the piece: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated diction ("whispers floated, promising the mirage of safety"; "powder's restless energy"; "kaleidoscope that painted the walls with muted rainbows"). Template-cadence runs dominate the middle third ("She whispered… She lifted… She pressed… She whispered again…"), creating a droning rhythm. Paraphrase loops recur (the mask's shards "catching light" / "glimmering" / "reflecting" across multiple beats). Many lines are decorative rather than propulsive, and key actions (the emotion crystallizing) are asserted rather than shown. Clarity suffers under the figurative load.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Several paraphrase loops appear: the narrator restates the convergence of narratives and the preservation decision across multiple adjacent sentences in the second half without adding new pressure. Template cadence surfaces in parallel constructions ("Each grain tells… a valve here, a channel there"; "When the first sunrise… I will emerge"). Stock metaphors ("bridge between past and present," "heartbeat echoing") dilute precision at key moments. No loops touch the closure beat directly, but cumulative artifact load reduces propulsion in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting and template artifacts pervade the text: "Her mission, to braid diverse voices into harmony, felt as delicate as threading golden threads through a tapestry of silence" stacks metaphors without clarity. Paraphrase loops abound ("Each note denoted a memory…a thread connecting…" immediately followed by "the chords faded…hatred…rusting away"). Synonym churn on "denote" (used four times) and recycled stems ("She inhaled…She invited…She understood…She watched…She closed") create monotony. Stock metaphors ("iron chains rusting away," "dust on ancient tomes") and elevated register ("crucible," "syncing," "carry-through") do not match the scene's immediacy. Figurative density in every sentence—"breath that seemed to pull autumn leaves," "rosette glowed brighter," "velvet ambience breathed"—obscures causal linkage and dulls momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("denoted a new beginning"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated diction ("invisible gears," "quiet gardener," "nascent ideas," "symphony of hope") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.7 for density without escalation. Paraphrase loops: "gentle rebellion" restated three times without added pressure; "memory" and "ruins" recycled across adjacent lines. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Mara [verb]" without variation. Clarity suffers when vines possess "neural clusters" and plants have "nervous filaments"—mixed metaphors that strain coherence. Information density is low; most lines restate atmosphere rather than advance causality.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting saturates the text: nearly every sentence in the opening and closure beats layers figurative language ("lightning collection tower hummed with dormant energy," "nectar dusk," "honey from the sky") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops appear: "Mara understood...the echo to be heard" restates prior material without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third: "The reveal...allowed her to fulfill..."; "The citizens...began to gather..."; "In the gentle hush...the city found..." (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("wound on the city's heart," "hidden fireworks") and synonym churn ("wonder," "spectacle," "miracle") reduce density. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and thesaurus churn: "quiet bay" / "calm," "hush" / "silence" / "quiet" recycled across adjacent lines without pressure. Template cadence dominates ("I was there not for... but to," "I felt the... not as... but as"). Stock metaphors cluster in the final third ("pulse like a heart," "warm ember," "lights the path"). Mixed vehicle: streetlights both daydream and are "fully awake." Figurative density in most sentences without clear payoff. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "cascading revelations" appears four times; "nuance into certainty" is restated across multiple beats without adding pressure. Template cadence runs dominate (e.g., "The statue threaded... the statue forced... the statue guided"). Stock metaphors ("threads of a loom," "drinking wisdom from a glass chalice") and elevated diction ("primordial foundation," "iridescent mosaics") in most sentences create density without information gain. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to inhale," "seemed to breathe") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("forever threading kindness"), triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "boundless confinement" recurs without reweighting, "balancedly daring" is restated as "half mathematician, half poet," and "perpetual motion" appears in multiple near-identical phrasings. Template cadence runs through the middle: "The staircase responded... Soon the whole structure quivered... Aric felt the boundless confinement lift..." uses parallel stems without variation. Stock metaphors ("wounded star," "living algorithm," "quiet anthem") stack without fresh vehicle. Information density is low—many sentences restate the quest's premise rather than advancing situation or choice. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("the staircase sang a quiet anthem"), so the −1.7 floor applies and 9+ is disallowed globally.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings show variation, but phrasing loops across beats: "methodically hopeful" appears twice, "each [X] a [Y]" template recurs four times ("each brushstroke a quiet promise," "each line glowed," "each hue a patient hymn," "each stroke a promise," "each line traced," "each curl a syllable"), creating template-cadence drag (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("colors of lost languages," "quiet conduit," "saffron-lit bridge") and elevated register ("hymn of reconciliation," "visual lexicon of remembrance") dilute immediacy in high-density beats (−0.4). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the opening and closing paragraphs without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, pushing density into overwriting (−0.3). Accumulated artifact penalty: −1.2 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "displaced persons" recurs five times, "emerald-tinted lens" four times with identical phrasing, and multiple beats restate the same content (e.g., "the city fell into a quiet" / "a subtle warming that promised the return of sound and color" / "the grotto city pulsed anew"). Template cadence appears in stacked "the [noun] [verb]" constructions without variation. Figurative language clusters densely ("ribbons of water," "candles in wind," "stone veins glowing," "prism of hope") in the final third without taught pattern or payoff, muddling the closure image. Stock metaphors (dread as sweetness, thaw as hope) replace concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "He felt the bleak exhilaration" appears twice verbatim; "latent radiance" recurs mechanically five times without meaningful evolution; "hunger stone" and "counter clockwise clock maker" are synonym-churned across adjacent lines. Stock metaphors ("dying star," "thin ribbon") and therapy-speak labels ("restless heart") populate peak beats. Figurative density in the opening paragraph (ocean breathing, teeth cliffs, hunger stone glowing) lacks coherent vehicle logic. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "realized") cluster in high-pressure moments, flattening immediacy. The closure beat itself is summary rather than charged image. Artifacts touch closure; applying −1.7 baseline plus pattern spread penalties totals roughly −2.0, compounded by lack of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphors and elevated diction ("rotten lantern," "slithering susurrus," "phosphorescence that clung like a disease," "ribbons of black smoke," "nauseating aurora") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.7). Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "lingering luminance" appears eight times, often in adjacent sentences restating the same atmospheric effect (−0.4). Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or use participial phrases to stack simultaneous actions (−0.4). Mixed metaphors: the clasp "seeps into her veins" (liquid) then the carnival "inhales" and "exhales" (breath), then shadows "unspool like ribbons" (textile), breaking coherence (−0.5). Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy ("seemed to," "feeling," "watched as"). Artifacts touch closure beats throughout, triggering additional caps per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence runs pervade: "He [verb]… he [verb]…" across multiple beats, and "Each [noun]" opens three sentences in close succession (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "turning the shifting vapor into melodies" / "theory that every obstacle could be rendered into sound" restate the same idea (−0.2). Mixed metaphor: rhythm "twisting like seaweed" then "sending ripples of sound that curled around the driftwood like tides" contradicts vehicle logic (−0.4). Stock phrases: "simple yet profound," "blue hour," "restless euphony" (repeated six times). Information density is low—beats recycle description without advancing knowledge or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language ("molten ribbon," "feather," "sea-green glow") is vivid but occasionally dense without clear pattern-teaching payoff. Minor loops: "the silent watchers" appears six times with minimal variation; "pattern" recurs frequently in the final third, edging toward synonym churn. Sentence openings vary. Information density is reasonable, though some lines serve primarily atmospheric goals ("bathing the turtles in gold that felt both hopeful and foreboding"). No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative minor issues (figurative density, repetitive anchor phrases) prevent entry into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from extensive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple sentences restate the same content: "truth he sought lay tangled among noble lies" / "noble lies—stories told to protect societies" / "such glue could imprison truth in a pit of lies." Stock metaphors recur without pressure: "weight of centuries settle like dust," "steam from old locomotives," "glass fragments of fractured memories." The phrase "pit of lies" appears four times, "noble lies" six times, and "illuminated letter" eight times, often in adjacent beats without added nuance. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("transparent honesty," "authentic history") that clashes with the scene's tactile potential. These artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, dulling the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.2)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("skeletal fingers," "mute witnesses," "cloak of flame," "wet parchment"), creating density without corresponding clarity or propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "interlaced absence" recurs five times with minimal variation in meaning, and "quiet fire" / "hushed blaze" are synonym-churned across beats. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She waded… She slipped… She recorded… She felt… She pressed… She whispered… She lifted… She walked…" The final third stacks these patterns without modulation, applying −0.9 for pervasive artifact spread and −0.3 for metaphor density that obscures rather than sharpens. Automatic disqualification from 9+ globally applies per artifact-in-final-third rule.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and decorative synonyms pervade: "reclaimed stillness" appears four times without changing meaning; "dappled resolve" recurs as ornament; "tranquilly perceptive" is asserted twice without embodiment. Template cadence visible in "She discovered... She pressed... She emerged" sequences. Stock metaphors: "words were weighed with weighty intent," "story was anchored." Figurative density in non-peak beats (lantern painting "dappled resolve") obscures rather than propels. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.7)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "luminous torment" appears five times; grief/sorrow/loss cycle without added nuance; "transform," "polish," "record" repeat within adjacent lines. Template cadence: "He [verb]... He [verb]..." structures dominate. Mixed metaphors: shadows "drift like ink" yet "paradoxically descend," cranes are both paper and satellites. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments ("He watches," "He knows," "He feels"). Figurative density in most sentences ("fireflies into cages of crystal," "ether closer to his fingertips," "constellations on a silent night") without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is ambitious and image-rich, but suffers from overwriting and repetition. "Intangibly tangible" appears three times without functional variation, and metaphoric density ("grief was a fuel," "sky… as if mourning," "circuit breakers… hissing like dying beasts") clusters heavily in early beats without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear: "the hunt was not for an external treasure but for the moment when potential became palpable" echoes "unused potential was not a place but a state of being." Template cadence runs through the middle third ("He sensed… He realized… He lowered…"), flattening propulsion. The final paragraph stacks three near-synonym closures ("the hunt was over," "the search… would continue," "knowing the bleak sky could no longer drown his resolve"), diluting the ending's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence is pervasive: "The [noun]" opens multiple sequential sentences, and "brilliant dimness" recurs seven times without pattern-payoff, reading as synonym churn for atmospheric effect. Paraphrase loops appear—paragraphs restate "missing pieces" and "frequency" across adjacent lines without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a," "seemed to smile") dull immediacy in peak beats. Mixed metaphors muddle sense: "luminous ribbons that seemed to ripple with forgotten frequencies" conflates visual, tactile, and auditory vehicles. Stock phrasing proliferates: "sharp-eyed," "perpetually surprised," "thrill," "profound unity." Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph reprises "brilliant dimness" and "perpetually surprised joy"), triggering stacked penalties (−1.7 baseline, global 9+ disallowed).

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, particularly in the opening third: "secret histories I sold" / "false memories...stitching together" / "fabricated recollection" restates the profession without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("I sought...hoping," "I placed...and a low hum rose," "I walked...knowing") across adjacent beats. Stock metaphors ("tide of remorse," "metronome of redemption") and elevated register ("tempered regret," "withheld truth") cluster in peak beats without voice-motivated grounding, reducing immediacy and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.1)
    "Furrowed hush" appears four times, a recycled phrase that becomes template cadence. Paraphrase loops: "untether" recurs across three beats with near-identical framing (rope untethered, untethering weight, untethered rope reminder). Filter-verb stack in reflection block: "felt the weight lift," "recalled a past error," "felt the furrowed hush soften," "felt the cycle close." Metaphor muddle: the drawer pull is a "reminder," "compass," "hinge," "token" without coherent vehicle. Stock phrase "weather-worn resolve" and "collective sigh of relief" dull specificity. High artifact density across closure beats triggers Q7 penalty and disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "backlash of regrets" appears three times in near-identical phrasing; "flickering faith" recurs four times; "when expectations collapse" is repeated verbatim twice. Template cadence dominates high-pressure beats ("He lifted… and felt," "He set… and the rhythm," "He recalled… and now"). Figurative density is unrelenting—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile—without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating opacity rather than propulsion. Mixed metaphors: "waves he rode" conflates kayaking with surfing; "drafting a narrative" imports writing into paddling without coherent vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.3)
    Figurative language is dense throughout high-pressure beats ("labyrinth of choices," "veins of a heart," "tapestry of humanity") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "clean slate" is restated across multiple paragraphs, and the final third recycles "labyrinth," "empathy," and "dirty past" in adjacent lines. Template cadence is present in the opening ("After the procedure, I emerged... My past was... I was a seeker..."). These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the closure image, applying cumulative deductions in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: the orchard's permanence, Liora's steadiness, and Arion's spiritual presence are restated across multiple paragraphs without added detail. Figurative language clusters densely in every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching: "filament of starlight," "pulse she could feel through her soles," "cosmos contract," "space thinned to a filament of shared breath." Template cadence runs: "Ever steady, ever loving, ever bound." Register drifts into New Age/therapeutic idiom ("cosmic intimacy," "celestial fire") that clashes with fairy-tale setting. The closure beat is obscured by metaphor stacking rather than made legible.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy overwriting: figurative language (velvet, staircase of mist, nebula, spider silk) saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalty. Paraphrase loops abound—"crack was a map," "fissure reflecting fragmented memory"; "whispered their names…believing syllables could stitch" then "each utterance pulled at the crack." Template cadence: "She moved…She knelt…She recalled…She whispered…She followed…She unfastened…She turned…She watched…She rose." Register drift into elevated poetic diction ("luminous hush," "harmonic tide") clashes with the task-oriented present. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her story becoming a whisper among the winds"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "The shadow work was not merely a repair; it was an unveiling" immediately follows explanation of the same idea. "She pressed the crystal… and the tear's shimmer rippled" / "The crystal glowed brighter, the tear's shimmer expanding" recycles imagery without new pressure. Template cadence dominates: "The [noun] was [quality], [elaboration]" recurs across a dozen sentences. Purple figurative density ("photons like mournful fireflies," "colors that had no names," "a stitch in the cosmos") blurs rather than sharpens key beats. Stock openers ("When Nara felt," "She whispered," "From that point") flatten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades: "whispering hush," "vibrant hush," and "luminous" each appear 4+ times; "orchestrated coincidence" and "texture of transformation" loop without fresh angle. Template cadence ("She lifted… She set… She watched…") and stacked metaphor ("captive constellations," "luminescent chorus," "transient patterns," "luminous carpet") blur clarity in the middle third. Filter stacks ("seemed to hum," "seemed to pulse," "as if drawn") dull immediacy. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.1)
    Pervasive ornamental phrasing and paraphrase loops flatten momentum: "calmly inventive precision" is restated as "calmly inventive yet urgent," then "ever calmly inventive"; "winking hush" recurs four times without evolving function. Template cadence runs dominate (multiple "the fort…" and "Kael…" sentence stems); stock metaphors ("shy fireflies," "sleeping giant") lack specificity. High figurative density in nearly every sentence (phosphorescent pulse, constellations, moss, canvas, lattice) obscures rather than sharpens action. Information density is low—beats summarize rather than advance ("he spent the blackout hours slipping…leaving coded marks" tells an entire sequence without dramatization).

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "lingering promise" appears nine times with minimal variation, often in adjacent sentences ("the lingering promise became clear" / "She felt a new promise stir" / "turned a lingering promise into a living map"). Template cadence runs for three+ sentences: "She knew… / She turned… / She felt…" without syntactic variety. Stock metaphors cluster without payoff: "violet ribbons," "silence settled like frost," "mist that caught the waning aurora." Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("She feared," "she believed," "She knew," "She felt") dull immediacy (−0.5 for stack, plus loop penalties totaling −1.2 in Q7; final third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8). Informational density is low—many sentences restate mood or theme without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.7)
    Template cadence: runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems across multiple paragraphs (−0.6). Paraphrase loop: "cartography of scars" recurs six times without added pressure; "furiously tranquil" echoed twice; "vigil in pause" stated, then restated in final lines (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: clouds "churned like ink on parchment" yet earlier "restless" and later "thinned"—vehicle shifts without coherent logic (−0.3). Overwriting in peak beat: "fragments rose a new stanza, a map of the scars rendered in luminous ink that glowed"—stacked figurative vehicles blur sense (−0.4). Closure beat touched by scaffold ("silent invitation," "quiet poetry"). Total artifact penalty −1.7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per rule.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.4)
    Persistent paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent lines: "questions into destinations" recurs five times; "dignified chaos" appears three times without evolving meaning; "hidden overture" is repeated mechanically. Template cadence dominates: "The philosopher… The diplomat…" alternates without syntactic variety. Figurative language stacks without coherence ("mirror of purpose," "compass of thought," "lecture without a lectern"). Information density is low; many sentences restate the same idea. The final third remains as abstract as the opening, and artifacts touch the closure beat ("hidden overture lingered, a secret promise").

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "rusted library under stars" / "prison library, rusted yet stubborn" / "beneath the rusted library under stars." Template cadence dominates the final third: "Each night Lira shed... / Rook, in turn, offered... / The coffee tin's false bottom... / Lira planted..." (−0.8 for clustered stem runs; 9+ disallowed globally). Stock metaphors stack without tension: "trembling candle," "veins of light," "mosaic of green light." Synonym churn for "rebuild" / "reconstruction" / "rebuilt" across adjacent lines adds −0.2. Nearly every sentence in the second half restates prior content without added pressure, momentum collapses into summary, and the final paragraph is pure scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervasive: "silence/silent" repeated five times, "steely longing" three times, "flickering compasses" three times without evolving meaning. Template cadence in final third: "He [verb]" six consecutive times. Mixed metaphors: "taste of steel and longing," "tide-woven branches," "horizon invites night" lack physical coherence. Stock poetic diction ("silver rain," "velvet shadows") replaces concrete action. Information density very low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation (−1.2 cumulative in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("lanterns that hummed," "petals falling onto a still pond," "leaves shimmering like silvered pages"), but most images cohere without contradiction. However, the climactic passage stacks metaphor without pause: "luminous doubt," "bright uncertainty," "engine of her resolve," "wind of thought," and "scent of old stories" appear within three sentences, diluting clarity at a peak beat. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "One fragment glowed brighter: a memory… She realized the seed… The method of waking… Mara began to name…" uses similar stems across four consecutive units. Paraphrase loop: "the seed would only sprout before the monsoon arrives" and "the monsoon's first heavy breath could drown the fragile shoots" restate the same temporal constraint without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for template cadence, −0.3 for figurative density at closure, −0.2 for paraphrase loop; total artifact penalty −1.1, lowering from a baseline ~7.4 to 6.3.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.7)
    Patterned artifact penalty pack applies: paraphrase loops across adjacent lines ("diffuse," "rhythmically placid," "tides of remembrance" recycled without added pressure), template-cadence runs ("He whispered," "He placed," "He instructed"), and stock metaphor strings ("leaves rustling in rhythm with the tide's sigh"). Applying −1.2 in Q7 for pervasive loops and scaffold. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the closure beat without pattern-teaching payoff, triggering additional −0.5 for density overwriting. Information density is low; many lines restate the same content.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense; images like dust “settled like snowfall” and the greenhouse “breathing sanctuary” are vivid and legible. The piece sustains a lyrical register without slipping into full purple prose or obscuring sense, and there are no major scaffolding or repetition artifacts. That said, some phrasing is redundant in concept (decay as data, dust as catalyst, humility as lesson) and a few metaphors arrive close together, slightly flattening momentum. These are minor enough that closure remains clear, but they hold the piece just below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level writing is fluent, grammatically clean, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Yet figurative density is high and relatively uniform, so the rhythm doesn’t sharpen much at key pressure points; everything is equally hushed and luminous. Some phrase and concept repetition (“drifting resonance,” “steadily adaptive,” “scorched testament,” “quiet pauses”) borders on scaffold rather than progression. The prose is strong but could benefit from more variation in texture and a few strategic cuts to avoid mild purple overgrowth.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clean, varied, and dense with information, and the prose often does double duty for mood and character. A few metaphors and abstractions (“a quiet that settled in her chest like a heavy tide,” “promise of redemption for every unheard story”) pile up toward purple and slightly slow momentum. There are some mild repetitions around silence, breath, and marvels, but no serious loops or structural artifacts. The closure image is clear and not obscured by figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme—e.g., the library becoming “a giant, trembling eye” or the lens’s light as a “soft hymn.” Despite frequent figurative language, metaphors generally cohere and do not collapse into muddle, and sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum. There is some repetition of key phrases (“impossible spaces,” “chased stillness”), and a few lines edge toward purple, but they do not materially obscure sense or closure. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for a demanding venue, though a slight trim could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, fluid, and image-rich, with only rare syntactic or clarity issues. Some phrases and structures echo (“amplified quiet,” “soft glow,” “gentle pressure,” “quiet step at a time”), creating a mild sense of sameness and softening impact. Figurative language (bell as heartbeat, smoke, lullaby) is coherent but occasionally layered without adding new information. Overall momentum is adequate for a lyric piece, though a few sentences summarize ideas already dramatized and could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-by-line craft is generally strong, with high information density and evocative metaphors (“rooms of light and shadow that whispered histories”) doing more than one job at once. However, figurative language is nearly constant, and some phrases feel like ornamental flourish rather than necessary meaning, creating a mild sense of purple prose and reducing contrast. There is some conceptual repetition around breathing and glow that could be tightened. Clarity remains intact, but a bit more spareness at peak beats would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with many doing double duty for setting and theme. The figurative language is often striking, but density is high—nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction—so the effect occasionally borders on purple and slightly blurs emphasis. There are minor repetition tendencies (“texture of time,” “reverie”) that could be pared for greater impact. Nonetheless, momentum and clarity hold, and the final paragraphs land cleanly on an evocative image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied, and information-dense, and images like “a spiraling stair that descended into the earth like a forgotten throat” are vivid and memorable. There is some flirtation with purple prose and metaphor stacking (“strange fletching” catching light like constellations; walls as throats; seeds as sleeping hearts), but clarity is rarely compromised. The prose occasionally repeats conceptual beats in slightly different wording (hope, resilience, renewal) without adding pressure, which mildly blunts momentum. Overall, though, the language is clean, mostly economical, and supports rather than obscures the narrative and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is above average: sentences are largely clear, musical, and dense with meaning; figurative language usually tracks. That said, the prose leans toward purple, with metaphor density and repeated constructions (“each…,” “while…,” “as…”) that at times blur emphasis and create a gentle monotony. Several insights are repeated in slightly different wording (memory as bridge/forge; broken trust leaving traces), which could be tightened. None of this destroys clarity, but it does modestly dilute impact.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose offers many striking lines (“constellations that shifted like thoughts,” “lanterns hung like suspended fireflies”), with generally clean syntax and few genuine clunkers. However, figurative language is very dense and often stacked, creating a near-uniform shimmer that flattens contrast and can verge on purple. Some metaphors repeat the same semantic territory (“liquid dusk,” “liquid silver ribbons”) without adding new information or pressure. Despite this, readability and closure clarity remain intact, and outright redundancy is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with several memorable images (meltwater pooling “like liquid glass,” the bookmark catching sunrise). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and certain phrases and concepts (“weighty lightness,” thawing heart, labor-as-liturgy) recur in slightly different guises, edging into mild redundancy. The purple register occasionally softens impact instead of sharpening it, but it does not obscure causality or closure. Tightening a few repetitious turns of phrase would significantly increase sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is rich and imagistic, with strong opening and closing lines and generally clear sentence-level causality. Many sentences do double duty—advancing action while sustaining atmosphere—and there’s little outright redundancy or scaffolding. That said, figurative language is dense and occasionally borders on purple (“hovered on the edge of the universe,” “every betrayal can be turned into a beacon”), slightly blurring impact through over-insistence. A bit more restraint and variation in metaphor would sharpen momentum and emotional focus.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and textures (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” “by summarizing silence”) that veers toward redundancy rather than purposeful patterning. Figurative density is high nearly everywhere, which sometimes blurs emphasis and weakens contrast between beats. Even so, there are no serious clarity failures, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often lovely and image-rich, with strong phrases like “each droplet fell like a tiny comet,” but it veers toward conceptual repetition around “amalgamate,” “resonance,” and “looped timelines.” Several sentences restate the same idea (thoughts as echoes, loops, amalgamation) in slightly different language, creating mild redundancy. The figurative density occasionally risks purple but does not fully obscure clarity. Tightening repetition would significantly sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong rhythmic control and layered images that do multiple jobs (e.g., puddles as mirrors of confession). However, there is noticeable repetition (“ambiguously clear,” “resonant hush,” “freed by honesty”) and some purple overgrowth where figurative density exceeds the scene’s pressure, slightly dulling impact. Tightening a few loops and abstractions would sharpen momentum and clarity at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often lovely, with strong images like marbles holding “a faint glimmer of forgotten rain” and the maze “breathing” in rhythm with his work, and it maintains clarity throughout. At the same time, figurative language is nearly constant, and some phrases verge on purple or redundant (“blooming withering” repeated; multiple mentions of measured luck and quiet pulses), which slightly dulls impact. There are a few paraphrase-like restatements of the same idea in adjacent lines (e.g., polishing as ritual, then again as elaborate commemoration) that could be tightened. Nonetheless, syntax is controlled, grammar is clean, and the final cadence lands with a coherent image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level work is polished and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. There is, however, a tendency toward stacked metaphors and repeated paradoxes (“icy warmth,” sideways time, humming/heart) that verge on purple and occasionally feel redundant rather than deepening. Some phrases paraphrase prior content in slightly different language, which modestly slows momentum in a short piece. Despite these minor excesses, clarity remains high and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong—dense with image yet clear, and most sentences do double duty for mood and story. Recurring water and music metaphors are coherent and support the central conceit. At times, the language edges toward purple and repetitive (e.g., multiple uses of “trembling,” “wordless conversation,” and similar textures) which slightly blunts impact at this length. Still, momentum is maintained and the closure image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the closure image is clear and well-framed. However, figurative density runs high across the entire piece—“auroral sorrow,” “bruised gold,” “swaying certainties,” “cloud that knows its own density”—occasionally approaching purple and blurring sharpness rather than sharpening it. There are mild repetition patterns in diction and concept, but no major loops or scaffold that stall momentum or obscure causality. Overall, it’s strong line-level work that would benefit from a touch more restraint and a few plainer anchor notes.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (e.g., beads as “frozen syllables”). However, metaphor and motif density sometimes verge on purple and repetitive—“drowsy alertness,” “ghost shift,” “swallowed truth/weight” recur in ways that occasionally feel like paraphrase loops rather than fresh turns. The rhythm trends toward long, similarly cadenced sentences, which can blur momentum in the absence of sharper structural variation. Despite this, clarity and line-level control remain solid, and the closure image is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatically clean, often multi-functional, and the imagery is vivid and sensuous. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition (e.g., reiterating “regenerative silence” and similar abstractions) that slightly slows momentum in a short piece. Still, cause-and-effect remain clear, and most figurative language is coherent and supportively patterned rather than haphazard. A modest tightening—cutting a few near-duplicate phrases—would likely sharpen impact without altering content.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clear and mostly well-shaped, with varied sentence rhythms and a strong atmospheric charge. At times it borders on purple and repetitive (frequent “hush,” “hum,” and restatements of ordinary magic and adaptability) without adding new pressure or detail. Still, line-level clarity and momentum hold; there are no loops that genuinely obscure meaning. The final images land cleanly, though a tighter pass could increase concision and reduce decorative redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically controlled, and dense with purposeful imagery that often does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and concept at once). Sentences generally propel rather than stall, and there are few if any outright redundancies. However, the concentration of figurative language and the recurrence of similar tonal descriptors edge toward overwriting in places, softening impact. The closure image is clear and not muddled by metaphor, but the overall density could be trimmed slightly for greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose has some strong, evocative lines and a clear rhythmic pattern, but it leans toward purple: dense metaphors and abstractions are stacked in many sentences, sometimes at the expense of freshness and precision. Phrases like “transpose life into a new key,” “key of humanity,” and “flag of revelation” feel slightly canned, and there are conceptual redundancies around secrets, fate, and encoding. Despite this, sentences are grammatically clean, causality remains legible, and there are no severe momentum-killing loops, just a tendency toward over-ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is confident and often striking, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme (e.g., “rosary of reverberations,” “decorated with silence”). Information density is high and momentum mostly sustained despite the lyricism. That said, metaphor and abstraction are heavily stacked—phrases like “decorated with silence,” “muffled clarity,” and “unraveling of stillness” recur in slightly varied forms, creating mild redundancy and occasional purple over-saturation. Clarity at the climax remains intact, but a tighter line edit could sharpen impact and reduce conceptual echo.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and dense, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme (“upended hush,” “membrane of vibrating chords”). Yet figurative language is almost continuous, creating a mild purple-prose effect and occasional redundancy (e.g., the hush/silence motif and mirror/horizon imagery cycle without adding new pressure). Momentum softens as description accumulates without sharper sentence-level contrasts. Clarity remains intact, but careful pruning could heighten impact and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence-level craft shows clear control and an ear for cadence, with many lines doing dual work for atmosphere and theme. That said, the prose is often overwrought: abstractions like “periodically eternal” and “darkening brightness” recur without fresh inflection, edging into pseudo-profundity. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (labyrinth of self, fractured timelines, algorithmic corridors) rather than advancing pressure, creating a mild sense of looped phrasing. Clarity survives, but judicious cutting and more concrete variety would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is often striking, with dense, sensuous metaphors like the cavern “yawned like a throat of stone” and the music unfurling as “invisible ribbons,” giving the piece a strong sonic-visual texture. However, figurative density verges on purple in places, with repeated constructions around “hush,” “filament,” and thawing numbness that occasionally feel redundant rather than additive. Abstract phrases and explicit theme-statements in the final third flatten some of the earlier, more suggestive imagery. Despite these issues, clarity is maintained and most sentences carry multiple jobs without obvious scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is mostly clear and fluent with good cadence, integrating description and interiority smoothly; information density is reasonable and there are few true redundancies. Some lines edge toward purple or abstract (“feeling the world pulse with an unspoken promise of renewal”) and several phrases repeat their own concepts in slightly different words, which modestly dulls momentum. Figurative language is generally coherent and not over-stacked, and syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical rhythm. A tighter pass to trim abstractions and repeated formulations could easily elevate this to a more elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is rich and generally controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and world-building (“amber glass panes caught the dying light like mute witnesses”). There is some tendency toward density and repetition—multiple “seemed to” constructions, repeated “crystal shadows,” and layered similes that slightly risk purple prose—but clarity remains intact. Momentum holds across the piece; description rarely stalls it outright. Tightening a few redundant phrasings would sharpen impact without altering the core style.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing shows strong rhythmic control and rich imagery, and it generally remains clear despite its density; phrases like “verses like cracked shells” and “bars of light” do layered work. However, the prose often edges into overwriting—stacked metaphors, repeated abstractions (“texture of time,” “impossible choices,” “ethically playful”) and synonymic restatements dampen momentum. Some sentences feel like thematic paraphrases rather than fresh advances of image or action, especially in the final third. These issues don’t break clarity or closure, but they hold the piece below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is often strong, with dense, multi-tasking sentences and striking images (“each hull resonated with a soft echo that reminded everyone of the ocean’s memory”). However, figurative language is nearly constant, leading to a slight sense of purple saturation and thematic repetition around silence, stories, and unfinishedness. Several adjacent lines restate similar insights in more abstract terms, especially near the end, which softens momentum and impact. Clarity remains high, but tightening and selective pruning would heighten the best images.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (e.g., static that “seemed to map the invisible currents of sorrow, joy, and longing”). Syntax is mostly varied and clear, and there are few outright redundancies or scaffolding phrases. However, figurative density is high throughout, with stacked metaphors and long sentences that can slightly blur impact and momentum, especially given the low conflict. A touch more restraint or sharper contrast between lush and spare passages would let key beats land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often graceful and image-rich, with some lines achieving memorable compression (“stories, like cargo, are loaded with intention”). Yet figurative density is high almost everywhere, and certain phrases and concepts repeat (cycles, cautious exuberance, compassion) in ways that verge on purple or redundant. There are few outright muddles, but the uniform lushness lessens impact and occasionally slows momentum. Tighter line-editing and more variation in texture would elevate it to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and high information density—many sentences do double duty for setting and theme. Figurative language is abundant but usually coherent and sensorially grounded, and there are no outright muddled metaphors or clarity failures. That said, the frequency of ornament (repeated “luminescent ache,” multiple “whisper/murmur” echoes) occasionally feels like purple excess rather than pressure-bearing detail. Trimming a few redundant or self-consciously poetic phrases would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant, with many striking images (“lattice of stone ribs,” “sketching a new hour on the sky”) and good information density. However, figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence, creating occasional purple-prose pressure and some conceptual redundancy around heartbeat, cadence, and time. A few sentences paraphrase prior ideas rather than adding new layers, which mildly slows momentum. Clarity remains intact, but a leaner selection of images would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is lush but largely precise: sentences do multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative density is high, yet most metaphors are internally consistent and tonally aligned; there’s little genuine purple muddle. There is some conceptual redundancy around “buried optimism,” “ambiguous loss,” and “mathematics of emotion,” which could be trimmed for even more impact. Still, the prose is strong enough for serious venues, with only minor overwriting as a drag.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: syntax is clear, sentences are mostly efficient, and the prose sustains mood without losing intelligibility. However, figurative density is high—multiple metaphors per paragraph, frequent repetition of key phrases—which edges into mild purple prose. Some sentences restate similar emotional content in slightly different words, creating a small amount of decorative padding. These issues dampen momentum and crispness, preventing top-tier scores.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, grammatical, and image-rich, with many sentences doing dual work in atmosphere and theme. There is mild overgrowth of figurative language and abstraction—“laboratory of patience,” “each droplet a data point,” “each whisper of wind an equation”—that edges toward redundancy rather than deepening. Some phrases and concepts recur in slightly different wording (“reluctant metamorphosis,” “releasing control,” “circuitous”/“circuitously”) in ways that feel more like echo than progression. Nonetheless, clarity and forward motion are maintained, and no single artifact undermines the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and emotional tone. Imagery is vivid and mostly controlled; the water motifs and color language are coherent rather than muddled. There is some reliance on repeated constructions and abstract phrasing (“meaning she had long been threshing,” “raw grief of the wars”) that could be tightened to sharpen momentum. No serious overwriting or figurative confusion impairs clarity, and the final paragraphs land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line by line, the prose is fluent and often lovely, with strong cadence and layered images like “a steady hum that felt both ancient and newly born.” There is an evident tendency toward over-saturation—metaphor on metaphor and repeated abstractions—which risks dulling impact and could be tightened for greater force. Still, clarity is rarely compromised, and most sentences carry both atmosphere and some narrative advancement. The final third maintains coherence without obvious scaffolding or loops, even if it leans heavily on similar rhetorical moves.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: images are precise, clauses do multiple jobs, and the overall rhythm sustains momentum despite a reflective mode. Some passages flirt with density and repetition of similar metaphors (memory as tide, fragments, stitching, echoes) that could be trimmed without loss, and a few abstractions (“reactively visionary,” “coherent story of the sea”) feel less vivid than the surrounding prose. Still, clarity is preserved, and both opening and closing images land cleanly. There are no major artifacts, but a bit of tightening could elevate the piece to elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level writing is generally clear, rhythmic, and grammatically clean, with strong sensory images like “ivy that seemed to breathe” and the “colossal eye” vault. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, with repeated motifs (“trembling certainty,” “starlit vault in mist,” glowing/whispering/echoing) that verge on purple and occasionally feel redundant. Momentum sags a bit under the descriptive load in the midsection. The prose is above-average but not yet trimmed to the precision and economy of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level work is generally polished, with rich imagery and few outright redundancies; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative density is very high and sometimes stacks similar metaphors (symphonies, lattices, arcs, breath, sediment) to the point of slight saturation, which can blur edge and slow momentum. Some conceptual phrases repeat the same idea in adjacent clauses, adding a touch of scaffold. Tightening a handful of abstract or near-duplicate lines would sharpen impact considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft shows care, with strong sensory choices (“scent of ozone,” “walls rippling, colors shifting from sapphire to amber”) and generally clean syntax. Yet figurative language and modifiers are dense almost everywhere, creating a purple cast and some conceptual redundancy (e.g., multiple variations on “hushed thunder,” “prismatic echoes,” “spatial mutiny”). Explanatory sentences about realization and meaning undercut the otherwise image-driven momentum, and trimming repetition would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images like the ink “swirl[ing] like a midnight river” and equations becoming “veins of gold,” and most sentences pull weight for atmosphere and concept. There is some tendency toward stacked abstractions and repetitive conceptual diction (rigidity, liquefying, dissolving walls, breaching veils) that risks mild purple and occasional redundancy. Nonetheless, rhythm and clarity survive these flourishes, and the final image (“twin vessels for change”) is clean and resonant. Line-level craft is above average but not yet razor-honed for maximal compression.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and musical, with many lines doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and theme in tandem. Imagery is generally precise (“each leaf a careful inkstroke,” “corners frayed like the edges of stories time had tried to erase”) and rarely confusing. There is some repetition of key terms and structures (“refract,” “invented histories,” “textures”) that nudges toward sameness and mild overwriting, but it doesn’t significantly obscure meaning or momentum. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, if a touch luxuriant for the small amount of narrative movement.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, mood, and theme (“layers filter reality differently, blurring some edges while sharpening others”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically unified around layering, texture, and filtering, so it reads as pattern rather than purple excess. There is some repetition of ideas (layers, fragments, filters) that could be trimmed without loss, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. Line-level clarity and syntax remain strong through the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose often has lovely phrases and a clear rhythmic intent, and it maintains momentum across a fairly static situation. Yet line-level density is high: figurative language and abstract nouns (“epistemic compass,” “universal riddle,” “gloomy cheerfulness”) stack frequently, sometimes blurring immediacy and emotional texture. Several ideas are reiterated with only minor variation (the compass pointing to questions-becoming-answers, hums spelling codes, gloomy/bright juxtapositions), creating mild paraphrase loops. The result is polished but somewhat purple, with room to cut and sharpen without losing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is fluent, clear, and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and plot (“hopeful desperation that rose like steam from the river” neatly fuses tone and setting). There is some tendency toward repeated abstract phrases (“hopeful desperation,” “perpetual carnival”) and stacked modifiers, but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. Key beats are not bogged down by scaffolding, and the final images (chip in a glass case, children playing, elders whispering) land cleanly. A bit of tightening and more varied embodiment of emotion would elevate the line-level further.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, grammatical, and rhythmically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some repetition of phrases and conceptual overlaps (“dawning hush,” “fleeting glow,” “melancholy of dawn”) that edge toward mild purple or redundancy but do not seriously drag momentum or clarity. Figurative language is generally apt and not confusing, and the final images land cleanly. Strong craft, though a sharper scalpel could pare some echoing and heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly economical, and often do double duty for atmosphere and character, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is abundant but generally controlled and coherent (“droplets catching the lantern light and scattering it like tiny prisms”); the ear-test reads smooth aloud. There is mild purple-creep and a few near-repetitions of conceptual phrasing (calm, promise, mist as partner), but they don’t obscure causality or dull the closure image. Overall, information density and momentum are high, placing this comfortably in a publishable range.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and thematic charge) without obvious scaffolding, and rhythm varies well. Figurative density is high—almost every line bears an image or metaphor—but they are mostly coherent and tonally aligned, avoiding true muddle. There are minor redundancies and echoing word choices (“herald,” multiple “whispers”/“whispering assurances”), and a few aphoristic phrases feel a touch on-the-nose. Overall, momentum holds and the final image lands cleanly, but a slight pruning of modifiers and repeated motifs would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally fluent and rhythmically aware, with many lines doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. However, figurative language and abstractions are overused, leading to mild purple-prose drift and synonymic repetition (e.g., multiple riffs on hush, rhythm, balance) that could be cut without loss. Sentences sometimes restate similar ideas—town as ghost, then revival, then living promise—without adding much new pressure or image. Tightening modifiers and reducing conceptual redundancy would markedly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    The line-level writing is often beautiful and information-dense, but it repeatedly veers into purple, with stacked abstractions and motif repetition (“gathered hush,” “unsnarl”) that start to blur impact. There are minor grammatical slips (“seemed to touches memories”) and some paraphrase-like reiterations of the same idea (vial calming panic/unsnarling thought) without added pressure. These choices dampen momentum and slightly obscure the sharpness of key beats. Tightening and pruning figurative excess would materially improve clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and imagistic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the lattice bending light and shadow as a metaphor for his impossible role). There are some noticeable repetitions (“through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades” appears twice almost verbatim) and a few near-purple constructions that risk blur rather than clarity. Momentum holds, but density of metaphor verges on excess in places, and some abstractions could be pared for impact. Line-level craft is strong but not yet at a ruthlessly distilled, elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich, musical, and mostly precise; images like “the taste of molten hope” and “glass walls turning translucent with the memory of countless suns” carry genuine force. That said, figurative language appears in almost every line, and some phrasing repeats similar emotional notes (mournful/venomous/echoing) without adding new information, creating mild density drag. Clarity of action and closure is preserved, but a demanding editor would trim a layer of ornament to sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatically clean, rhythmically varied, and image-dense. Some metaphors and phrases repeat (“orchid” in multiple guises, “hauntingly optimistic,” “silence”) and the density of figurative language edges toward purple but mostly maintains clarity. There are minor paraphrase tendencies (restating her mission and the labyrinth’s transformation) that could be pared for tighter momentum. Still, most lines do at least two jobs—world-building and thematic reinforcement—without collapsing into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong concrete images and a generally high information density—description often carries atmosphere, world-building, and thematic weight simultaneously. There is some repetition of motifs and phrasing (“purposeful wandering,” roots humming, faith mended) that edges toward overstatement, and the piece occasionally leans into purple territory. Nonetheless, clarity is never compromised, and the final images land cleanly. Tightening a few redundant lines could heighten momentum without sacrificing richness.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is fluent and imagistically rich, with many sentences doing atmospheric and conceptual work at once. That said, figurative density is high and occasionally borders on purple, and certain ideas (“margins,” “futures”) recur in ways that feel like conceptual repetition rather than new pressure. A few lines rely on generalized lyric shorthand rather than fresh image, which blunts impact. Overall clarity remains good, but tighter pruning and more selective metaphor would elevate it to a truly elite line level.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Occasional tendencies toward purple or conceptual phrasing (“echoed silence that pressed on ears,” repeated “adjacent possibilities”) risk abstraction but don’t materially cloud meaning. There are no major loops or scaffolding repetitions; progression is generally clean. The final paragraphs land a clear, vivid image without figurative muddle, even if some lines could be sharpened by pruning adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is lush and image-rich, generating strong atmosphere and a clear visual throughline from pane to lagoon. Sentences generally carry multiple functions (setting, mood, theme) without losing basic clarity. That said, there is noticeable redundancy in phrasing and concept (e.g., repeating “ready to carry messages in condensation on windows”) and a near-constant figurative register that occasionally borders on purple, reducing impact. Tighter pruning and more varied rhythm at high-pressure beats would sharpen momentum and keep the lyricism from feeling over-saturated.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with striking images like “the sky is a cracked mirror of bombs” and the coral’s porous lattice holding anxieties. However, figurative language is dense and sometimes stacked (“lotus-hearted ache,” “soft chorus of sighs,” “cipher of shared anxieties”), edging toward purple and occasionally blurring impact. Some conceptual repetition around mist, grafting, and shared fear could be tightened without loss. Line-level craft is above average but would need trimming and sharpening for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and image-rich, and it carries the accumulative pattern smoothly from start to finish. At the same time, there is noticeable repetition and purple-leaning density—many metaphors for light, fog, and joy that do similar work, plus echo phrases (“thick fog,” “pensive mirth,” “luminous”) that feel like loops rather than intensifications. Some lines summarize emotional stakes already implied by image. The text is polished but would benefit from pruning and sharper selectivity to reach elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally polished, with vivid images and efficient, flowing sentences; most lines do double duty advancing both atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is very dense—“nested awakenings,” “blossom of air,” “auroras,” “Russian dolls,” “ripples,” “chorus of endless possibilities”—creating occasional purple-prose pressure and some sense of conceptual overlap. A few phrases restate similar ideas (curiosity vs certainty, awakenings, reflected echoes) without adding new tension, slightly softening momentum. Tightening redundancy and pruning a few metaphors would sharpen the strongest images already on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms and imaginative, often memorable images that knit setting and theme. At times, figurative density borders on purple (“converging chaos into a single, luminous thread,” “kaleidoscope of fragrant, humming possibilities”), and conceptual phrases are repeated without always adding new pressure. The final third leans into summary and abstraction, slightly dulling immediacy, but clarity of action and image is maintained throughout. There are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts; most sentences carry at least two jobs (world, theme, mood).

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“photosynthesize pain into beauty,” “reef-shadow joy”). However, figurative language is nearly constant, which occasionally tips into purple density and reduces contrast and momentum. Some concepts (pain into blossoms, armistice, joy) are reiterated in adjacent lines without adding new pressure or specificity. Line-level craft is strong overall but could benefit from sharper pruning and rhythmic variation to reach top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft shows clear care: images are often striking, syntax is varied, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Yet the density of figurative language is high almost everywhere, producing moments of purple prose and slight redundancy (“gently systematic” appears twice; “foxglove regret” + “violet sorrow” pile similar notes). Some metaphors feel more decorative than necessary, which slightly blurs impact and saps momentum. Clarity remains intact, but tighter selection would sharpen the already strong visuals.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with smooth syntax, good rhythm, and few outright redundancies; most sentences carry both atmosphere and some narrative function. Yet the prose leans heavily on a narrow band of metaphors (music, light, promises, symphonies) to the point of mild overwriting and conceptual repetition. Occasional slips (“unsnarl-ing,” slightly purple intensifiers) keep it below top-tier concision and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level work is imaginative and dense, often doing multiple jobs at once by advancing action, image, and theme together. However, figurative language is almost continuous, and some phrases repeat or feel slightly overworked (“dappled resolve,” “encrypted compassion” echoed), edging into purple and softening impact. There are no real clarity failures or syntactic stumbles, but a bit of pruning would increase propulsion and keep standout images from competing with each other. Overall, the prose is strong but not quite at a ruthlessly edited, top-market level.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally graceful and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., dust motes as “paper trails” and pigeons as “living bridges”). Information density is high and the line-by-line rhythm rarely stumbles. However, the story leans toward purple in places, with stacked modifiers and repeated abstractions (“echo of lost songs,” “bloom with a withering grace,” “seed of hope”) that could be pared back for greater impact. This mild overwriting slightly blurs sharpness but does not materially obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lush and imagistic, with many sentences doing double duty (advancing both setting and theme) and very few true scaffolding lines. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent, and key actions—finding the seam, descending, touching the maps—remain clear. There is some risk of purple prose and abstraction (“fractured hush,” “space between wonder and understanding”) that could be sharpened into more embodied specifics. Still, rhythm and clarity hold, keeping momentum from stalling despite the lyric thickness.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is often beautiful at the line level, with strong images like “breath held in amber” and “ash‑black tip still humming with the memory of a comet’s tail.” Yet figurative language is nearly continuous, and several phrases repeat or stack without adding new information, creating a mild sense of purple density and reducing momentum. Some constructions (“her steps softly ingenious,” “cosmos of belonging”) feel more decorative than precise. Rhythm and syntax remain readable, but tighter pruning and variation would be required for elite-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept, and few outright clunkers. However, there is noticeable purple stacking and occasional redundancy (“recollection is a fragile tide that recedes before memory fades” repeats the same idea), plus a tendency to lean on similar syntactic rhythms. Figurative language is rich but nearly constant, which slightly flattens emphasis and risks blur at moments that should cut more sharply. Despite that, line-level control remains above average and closure is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery (“fireflies over the arcade's neon ribbons,” “shards that resembled tiny constellations”) and a clear rhythmic flow. There is some purple density and conceptual repetition around chaos/order and randomness that could be pared for greater sharpness and momentum. Still, sentences usually do more than one job—setting mood, advancing micro-action, echoing theme—without major loops or confusion. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, though not yet at flawless minimality.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and musical, with strong control of imagery and syntactic variety, and almost no scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are dense but, for the most part, coherent and consonant with the story’s dark-luminous palette; they rarely confuse the literal action. There is some flirtation with purple prose and repetition of certain phrases, but it doesn’t materially slow momentum or blur causality. Overall, the sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and action—without obvious loops.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally graceful and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty in image and theme; it reads smoothly at the line level. That said, there is a tendency toward purple density and lexical recurrence (e.g., repeated use of “noctilucent,” “ledger,” “read between lines,” “clear complexity”) that introduces a mild sense of redundancy. Some metaphors feel a bit stacked rather than distilled, slightly slowing momentum in a piece that already has low narrative pressure. It’s good, occasionally striking prose, but could be tightened and sharpened for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clear and often musical, with some striking images (“pine needles like distant applause,” “seam of mercy”). At the same time, figurative language is very dense and sometimes repetitive, with phrases like “hard softness” and “bargain of innocence” circling back without adding new nuance, creating a mild sense of purple, thematic redundancy. A number of metaphors feel conceptual rather than concrete, softening impact at key beats. Despite this, cause/effect and closure remain legible, and there are no serious grammatical or syntactic stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally fluent and rhythmically pleasant, with some strong images (sea-foam “draped” over stone, balloons turning air into a “kaleidoscope of potential”). However, there is noticeable repetition of concepts (hope, equations, timelines, decorations) without added nuance, which creates mild paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled; yet the accumulation of abstractions (“parallel timelines,” “current of communal optimism,” “living ledger”) occasionally dulls immediacy and momentum. Line-level craft is solid but not razor-sharp enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally smooth, with varied sentence structures and strong sensory choices around light, stone, and sound. Several phrases do double duty, carrying atmosphere and theme efficiently. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition (“legacy’s burden,” “dream hum,” “lullaby,” “symphony of stone”) and a few abstract formulations (“collective imagination”) that feel less sharp than the best lines. The prose never becomes truly purple or opaque, but tightening redundant and high-level phrases would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.5)
    The line-level is lush but over-saturated with metaphor and repetition, leading to a sense of purple density that blurs impact (“borrowed heartbeat” appears often without new facets, as do variations on harmony and echo). Information density is moderate because many sentences restate the same emotional or atmospheric content in different figurative dress. Momentum sags as images pile up without sufficient variation in rhythm or tension. Clarity is rarely lost, but the prose could be significantly tightened for power.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally smooth, grammatically clean, and rich in imagery; many sentences carry both atmospheric and thematic weight. However, it borders on purple in places, with frequent abstract pairings (“broken and whole,” “flawed beauty”) and repeated motif language that could be pared for greater punch. Some lines feel like near-paraphrases of prior sentiments about redemption, ideals, or celestial choreography, which slightly dulls momentum. Despite this, clarity remains high and the closure images (clipboard among swords, terrace at dawn) land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and generally high-density—most sentences carry setting, mood, and theme simultaneously. Some metaphors are striking and coherent, but there is a near-constant figurative load (maps, veins, echoes, glass, wings) that occasionally borders on purple and could use a few breaths of plainer texture. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and causality remains clear despite the lyricism. The closure image is not obscured by overwriting, but a slight trim would likely sharpen its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally fluent, with strong rhythmic control and many effective images; most sentences do more than one job (atmosphere plus action or theme). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, which edges into purple prose and can dull impact (“metallic tang of unresolved poems,” “harvested like ripe fruit”). There are minor paraphrase tendencies and repeated constructions, but they do not seriously impede clarity. The line-level craft is competent-to-strong, yet lacks the ruthless selectivity and precision that would justify elite-tier scores.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are syntactically clean, varied in rhythm, and rich in imagery, and there are few if any outright confusing constructions. That said, figurative density is high, with repeated metaphors (meteor hush, half-lit epiphany, reversal) and frequent similes that risk purple-prose saturation. A number of lines restate similar ideas (ethical storytelling as reversal, half-lit moral glimpses) without adding new pressure, slightly dulling momentum. Clarity survives, but a leaner, more selectively charged style would better serve an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is often beautiful, with strong rhythm and images that multitask for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “each ray stitching the night’s silence into day”). There is some purple-prose drift and repetition of concepts (“blushing stillness,” “interrupted cadence,” “linger”) that could be tightened without loss. Sentences generally carry their weight and maintain momentum in a lyric mode, though a few are more decorative than necessary. No major clarity or grammar issues impede comprehension or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level writing is often lush and striking, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, metaphor density is high and occasionally repetitive (“thawing fire,” “melting frost,” “snowmelt ardor”), verging on purple prose that slightly blurs edges rather than sharpening them. Despite this, syntax is mostly clean, rhythmically varied, and causality remains clear, so momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“a sound that felt both mournful and mischievously hopeful”). Information density is high and the rhythm mostly varied, supporting the accumulative, incantatory feel. There is some overwriting—frequent figurative language and repeated qualifiers like “precisely playful”—that verge on purple and could be pared without loss. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and there are no major scaffolding loops or muddled metaphors that obscure the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with strong sensory images (violet glow, dust spirals, amber dusk) and generally clear syntax. That said, it tends toward density and redundancy—many long sentences stack abstractions (“cosmic ledger,” “dusky harmony,” “encrypted devotion”) without adding new concrete pressure. Some phrases and structures recur in ways that feel like loops rather than deliberate patterning, slightly dulling momentum. The line-level craft is solid and readable but would benefit from strategic cutting and more varied sentence texture.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with several strong images (thoughts slipping “like a thin veil of mist,” the sanctuary “exhaling a sigh of relief”). There is some repetition of key phrases and a tendency toward mildly purple abstraction (“shifting grace,” “quiet anthem of peace,” “living tapestry of soft, invisible currents”), but it doesn’t seriously obscure clarity or causality. Sentences usually do more than one job—advancing plot while sustaining atmosphere. Trimming a few near-synonymous formulations and slightly tempering the grandiosity would tighten momentum for elite publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with multi-tasking images (e.g., fog as both medium of magic and veil over history). Figurative saturation is high, but metaphors are largely coherent and thematically aligned; clarity of action and causality is never genuinely obscured. There’s little scaffold or paraphrase looping, and each sentence tends to add a new facet to mood or process. The only limitation is mild over-lushness—nearly every line reaches for shimmer—which slightly flattens dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is competent and sometimes striking—e.g., “the light fell like a choir”—and maintains clarity of action and image. That said, figurative language and abstractions are overused, with multiple metaphors and thematic phrases stacked in close proximity, edging into purple prose. There is some conceptual redundancy around renewal, vows, accidental wisdom, and fractures-as-seeds that could be tightened without loss. Line-level craft is solid but not razor-sharp enough for top-tier literary publication given the overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are syntactically clean, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and motion). There is a tendency toward density and repetition of certain constructions and phrases (“simply complicated,” multiple “he realized / he understood” insights), nudging the prose toward mild purple at times. Still, there are few true scaffolding or synonym loops, and clarity is not compromised. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, though sharper cutting of abstract restatement would raise impact.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density: most sentences both advance the story and deepen the atmosphere. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and figurative language is mostly controlled and thematically aligned (books humming, vines responding to names). There is mild purple-prose risk and motif repetition (“unheard symphony,” “rescue mission”) that could be trimmed for an elite market, but it does not obscure sense or stall momentum. No significant scaffolding, looped paraphrases, or clarity issues are evident.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: vivid images, varied syntax, and good information density, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual over-layering (“memories alter like watercolor bleeding on old parchment,” “trapped freedom…rusted chains of light”), but coherence is mostly maintained and momentum does not stall. Minimal redundancy and clean grammar/punctuation keep the reading experience smooth, though a touch more restraint could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are generally well-shaped, with good rhythm and high information density; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and plot). A few abstractions (“clarity,” “confusion,” “absence,” “meaning”) recur often enough to slightly flatten texture, but they don’t obscure sense. Figurative language is controlled and mostly coherent; the occasional near-purple moment doesn’t tip into muddle. There is little scaffolding or obvious repetition, and the closing image is sharp and readable on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and vivid imagery doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) in a single line. Sentences flow smoothly and vary in rhythm, and there are no grammatical or clarity issues that impede reading. At times, though, the accumulation of figurative language (“dripping silence,” “bloom of hush,” “hammered repose,” “living auroras”) approaches purple and slightly dulls the sense of forward motion. A modest tightening of repeated motifs and a few over-decorated phrases would push the line work into a more rarefied tier.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, vivid, and rhythmically pleasing, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some repetition of concepts and images (hope, coincidence, purpose, thistle, hush) that occasionally verges on paraphrase rather than intensification. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; it rarely descends into genuine muddle, though a few lines tend toward purple abstraction over concrete advance. Overall momentum holds, but a light tightening of redundancies and a few abstractions would sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images (“solid fog,” “bruised violet sky,” “each feathered pen tip humming with latent histories”) and good information density. That said, figurative language is densely stacked, and motifs like “deepening hush” and “whispered” recur in ways that start to feel slightly overworked. A few sentences paraphrase similar ideas (preemptive nostalgia, sculpting identity) rather than advancing them, flirting with purple and minor redundancy. Despite this, clarity holds and rhythm is generally varied and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images like “a velvet blank that swallowed hope and sound alike” and fireworks as “moving tiles” in a sky-wide mosaic. However, there is noticeable redundancy and occasional purple phrasing (“the night was a hush of a night,” repeated “chanting while walking,” multiple “filter” iterations that add less each time). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; it sometimes slows momentum in a short piece that could benefit from tighter line-level progression. Overall craft is solid and above-average, but not yet ruthlessly edited for maximum precision and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose often achieves a pleasing musicality and image density (e.g., “echo that settled on stone like a whispered promise”), and line-level clarity remains high. Yet figurative language and abstractions accumulate to the point of mild purple prose, with several sentences reiterating similar ideas about tides, pauses, and reflections without adding new pressure. Repetitive scaffolding (“She felt…,” “She recalled…,” “She noted…”) and slightly redundant phrasing slow momentum in a short piece. Tightening and pruning a few metaphors and summaries would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often striking and layered, with strong sensory images and efficient anchoring, and it moves the story forward without major confusion. However, the density of figurative language is very high, with multiple metaphors in many sentences (“intangibly tangible,” “gilded hush,” “symphony of the void”), edging into overwriting. Some near-redundant formulations and self-conscious paradoxes add ornament more than pressure. Line-level clarity survives, but tightening and selective restraint would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and imagistic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme; images like “each droplet a tiny bell ringing without sound” are memorable. There is some repetition and mild purple-prose tendency: phrases and structures recur (“In the quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo,” “teach silence how to comfort”) without always adding new pressure or nuance. Figurative density is high but generally coherent; the metaphors share a glass/light/sound vocabulary rather than clashing. Line-level momentum holds, yet tighter pruning of near-duplicate sentiments would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid images and a steady forward motion from sentence to sentence. Some sections verge on purple, stacking modifiers and metaphors (“kaleidoscopic,” “glittered,” “luminous,” “neon,” “pixelated”) in quick succession, which can blunt impact and feel repetitive. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus symbolism). Trimming a handful of redundant flourishes would elevate this to a more elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the final cadence is strong. However, figurative density is high to the point of occasional purple—metaphor stacks and repeated formulations (“loaded emptiness,” “burned bridges carefully” twice) create a mild sense of redundancy. There are no serious clarity or grammar issues, but pruning could sharpen impact and momentum. Line-level craft is strong but not yet as ruthlessly precise as top-tier publication standards demand.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush, imaginative, and often does multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, mood, and theme—without losing basic clarity. That said, there is noticeable density of figurative language and abstract nouns in the final third, with some near-redundant phrasings about promises, pressure, and concepts becoming tangible. This veers toward mild purple prose and slightly dulls the sharpness of key beats, especially around the covenant articulation. Still, line-level craft is above-average, with few true clunkers and a mostly strong sense of rhythm and image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains many strong individual images (“ink shimmering like the first yawn of evening light”) and maintains clarity of action. Yet it is frequently overwritten, with stacked modifiers and recurring metaphors (“eloquently silent,” “golden shadows,” “bridge of intuition”) that create a sense of synonym churn. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about silence, intuition, and listening, which slightly drag momentum. Line-level craft is competent and often striking, but would benefit from pruning and greater variation in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-to-line, the prose is imaginative and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Yet figurative density is very high almost everywhere, producing purple, sometimes muddled patches (“factually mystical,” “as reality shifts” repeated, several near-synonymous riffs on possibility and night-as-canvas). There are minor grammatical slips (“he unsnap the lock”) and some conceptual redundancy where adjacent lines restate the same transformation in different metaphors. Tightening metaphors, trimming repetition, and sharpening a few images would markedly improve clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with many striking images (“dust rose, unfurling like a silent flag”) and efficient sentence flow. However, figurative language repeats (especially “unfurl,” “patterns,” “faint outlines”) and occasionally edges into purple, creating a mild sense of redundancy. Some sentences restate similar emotional beats (hope, broken heart, dust as testimony) without adding new pressure or detail. Trimming and varying imagery would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (e.g., “liquid memory” as both worldbuilding and motif), and grammar and sequencing are clean. That said, figurative language is very dense—“cryptic crossword of hope,” “phantom fireflies,” “language of glittering waves”—and occasionally drifts toward purple, with some conceptual repetition around maps, echoes, and indifference. Information flow remains clear, but a ruthless editor would trim several metaphors and nominalizations to sharpen momentum. Strong craft overall, just shy of the spare precision typical of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose offers many striking lines and layered metaphors, but figurative density is high nearly everywhere, creating a risk of purple saturation. Some phrases and constructions repeat without adding new information (“prism atrium in mist,” variations on dewdrops forming), and a few abstractions (“quietly vivid,” “vested hush”) feel label-like. Rhythm is generally smooth, yet trimming redundant modifiers and near-duplicate images would sharpen momentum and impact. Line-level craft is strong but not yet ruthlessly precise enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid imagery and reasonably efficient sentences that usually serve multiple functions (world-building, mood, and plot). However, figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction—which occasionally edges into purple and slightly blurs impact (“leaves that fell like ancient verses,” “soft prod of destiny”). There is mild conceptual redundancy around the same motifs (folklore, forgotten spirits, prophecy) without added pressure. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, and sometimes thematic hint) without collapsing into confusion, and rhythm reads well aloud. A few phrases edge toward purple or redundant (“hidden currents beneath the ashes of history,” reiterated uncertainty language), but they don’t seriously blur sense or stall momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent and on-theme, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym-churn. Slight tightening could make the prose even sharper, but it’s already publication-ready in many venues.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is nearly continuous—“mirror of storm-slick ripples,” “thin as a sigh,” “sunrise caught in a river of steel,” “luminous regret”—creating a persistent purple hue. A few conceptual redundancies around redemption, weight, and ledgers could be trimmed without loss, suggesting mild overwriting. Despite this, clarity and closure remain intact, and there are no serious syntactic or logical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is smooth, grammatically clean, and easy to follow, with a strong ear for cadence and several striking images. At times, modifiers and figurative language accumulate (“stories of redemption that twirled like fireflies,” “sunrise glass,” “liquid amber”), flirting with purple and slight redundancy. Nonetheless, information density remains decent, and each sentence generally advances atmosphere or emotion. No major loops or artifacts blunt the closure image; the main limitation is occasional over-ornamentation rather than structural weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is generally strong—varied syntax, vivid metaphors, and few wasted sentences. Key motifs (ultraviolet penance, pewter strap, mathematics/geometry of mercy) recur in a way that mostly deepens rather than simply repeats. That said, a handful of abstractions and repeated phrases (“ultraviolet penance,” formula-like moral statements) slightly blunt momentum and edge toward purple in places. Clarity is never seriously compromised, but a leaner cut would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding (“like an eternal instant captured in a drop of light”). However, figurative density is very high throughout, and similar metaphorical moves (light, constellations, bridges, fragments of memory) recur enough to border on purple prose. Some sentences could be tightened without losing meaning, and a bit more variation in texture would heighten impact. Clarity remains intact, but the constant lushness slightly blunts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally high: images are concrete, syntax is controlled, and most sentences do multiple jobs (atmosphere plus action or worldbuilding). The story occasionally edges into purple territory with stacked modifiers and metaphors that don’t always increase pressure, but clarity is never lost. There are no major loops or scaffold sentences bogging momentum. Tighter pruning of a few figurative flourishes would sharpen impact and lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often lush and striking, with many lines doing good double duty for atmosphere and concept, and sentence-level clarity is usually preserved despite the density of imagery. However, figurative language is nearly continuous and sometimes redundant (“rustling awakening,” “soundless promise,” “rustling awakenings” recurring without added nuance), edging toward purple and blurring impact. Momentum softens because almost every beat is equally ornate, so climactic moments don’t gain much extra sharpness or concision. For a top-tier venue, some pruning and variation in texture would be necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme, and the final paragraphs cadence nicely into the closing vow. However, the density of metaphor and repeated phrases (especially “burnished sorrow”) occasionally edges into purple, risking saturation rather than escalation. Despite this, clarity is maintained and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy; the style is controlled even when ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and clear, with generally smooth syntax and few outright redundancies; it reads comfortably aloud. Figurative language (“metal first learned to remember its own decay,” “garden of iron vines”) is imaginative and mostly coherent with the established metaphoric field. There is some risk of purple density and repetition of similar mystical formulations, but it doesn’t significantly obscure causality or closure. Line-level craft is solid, if not yet razor-honed for maximum compression and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images and a good balance of sentence lengths that sustain momentum through what could have been static description. Many sentences do double duty—advancing action while deepening atmosphere or theme—and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. The density of figurative language is high but not incoherent; most metaphors (hinges, sighs, star-water) belong to a coherent tectonic/rain/threshold vocabulary. A slight tendency toward over-ornamentation in places keeps it just shy of elite-line mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is often beautiful—“storm-tossed archway loomed like a weathered throat,” “sea maps dissolve into myth,” and the turbine hum as lullaby show strong sensory and figurative control. However, there is noticeable repetition (“through layered meanings” twice, “scaffold complexity with simplicity”), plus some dense metaphor stacking that occasionally veers toward purple. Most sentences do more than one job and maintain clarity, but trimming redundancies would sharpen momentum. The prose is clearly above average yet not fully free of excess or echo.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains many striking lines and a strong rhythmic sense, but it frequently tips into purple, with stacked modifiers and dense metaphor strings (“glowed with a quiet fire,” “world exhaled a gentle sigh,” “umbral tenderness”). Several sentences restate similar atmospheric effects, slightly dragging momentum in a story that already lacks strong conflict. Despite this, clarity is preserved and there are few outright muddled images. A tighter, more selective line edit would be required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is dense but largely precise, with most images doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“brass hull humming like a distant prayer,” “crystal that pulsed with data”). There are few, if any, true paraphrase loops, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. Some metaphors risk purple excess or abstraction (“retro­cognitively trapped,” “code of compassion”) without full dramatization, but they don’t obscure sense or closure. Overall, information density and rhythm would meet a high editorial bar with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally polished, with clean grammar and a good ratio of image to exposition, and many sentences do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme). However, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and structures—multiple nearly interchangeable lines about rejecting false comfort, memory as sparks, and revival as glow—which softens momentum. Figurative language occasionally veers toward purple or abstract (“fragile glass of remembered desire”), diluting impact rather than sharpening it. The closure image still lands clearly, but tighter pruning would heighten force.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with several lines doing simultaneous work for setting, theme, and mood (“tone that sang the city’s collective sighs in a language only the dead could hear”). At times, figurative language and modifiers stack to the edge of purple, and some sentences run long enough that momentum softens. There are mild redundancies in restating Harel’s mission and the archival loop near the end. Overall readability and cadence remain strong, but a demanding editor would trim and sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (image, world-building, emotional shading). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and pattern-consistent, supporting the accumulative/textural lens. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual redundancy (reiterating the covenant/vortex insight in slightly different abstractions), which could be tightened without loss. Nevertheless, clarity and momentum survive the density, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and well-paced, with a good balance between description and action; sentences often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and motion). There are mild repetitions and moments verging on purple, but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or slow momentum. Rhythm is varied enough, and the final images (the fading bell note, the spiral descent, the lingering hush) land clearly. Line-level craft is strong but not dazzlingly economical or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically controlled, and vivid, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, it leans into purple territory at times, stacking metaphors and abstractions (“air being polished by invisible hands,” “understanding blossomed like a flower in night”) in ways that reduce sharpness and momentum. There are minor repetition/loop tendencies around concepts of stillness, hush, and amber glow that feel redundant rather than additive. Clarity remains good throughout, and the closure image is not obscured, but tightening would be needed for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with many lines doing dual work for atmosphere and theme, especially around the box and bees. However, figurative density is very high—“promise,” “covenant,” “unspoken,” “whisper” recur frequently—creating mild redundancy and a risk of purple over-saturation. Rhythm and clarity generally hold, but some passages could be tightened without losing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammar sound, and most lines carry at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, or image plus plot). The figurative density is high—nearly every key object becomes a metaphor—which edges toward purple but rarely confuses meaning. There are few obvious loops or scaffolding phrases; momentum stays acceptable for a lyric piece. Slight pruning of modifiers and mixed metaphors would sharpen impact and better support the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Many lines are sonically and imagistically pleasing, and information density is generally high, with most sentences doing atmospheric and thematic work. Still, there’s noticeable repetition and paraphrase—“woven dawns,” “burnished hush,” “warmly attentive,” and near-duplicate insights about incompleteness recur without always adding new pressure. Figurative language is layered in almost every sentence, drifting toward purple and occasionally blurring emphasis. Momentum softens because the prose prioritizes texture over progression in multiple adjacent beats.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose often succeeds at doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, tone, and theme—within single sentences, and rhythm is generally varied and readable. At times it edges toward purple, with stacked modifiers and abstractions (“a countdown that pulsed like a quiet drum beneath her ribs,” “interspecies dialogue”) that add mood more than new information. Some summary phrases repeat concepts (“gently systematic,” “brazen calm”) rather than advancing momentum. Still, clarity remains intact, and there are several striking, clean images that carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong images and a good information-to-word ratio; very few sentences feel like pure scaffolding. Nonetheless, figurative density is high—metaphors piled in phrases like “melodic echo of far-off chemistry” and “bronze quiet symphony of discovery”—which sometimes blurs precision and slightly dampens momentum. There are minor redundancies (reiterations of “artificial pilgrimage,” “bronze quiet,” and similar atmospheric notes) that could be trimmed without loss. Line-level craft is strong but not yet razor-clean enough for top-tier publication in this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are grammatical, generally clear, and carry multiple layers of image and meaning. However, the density of figurative language and recurrent phrasing (“narrow vastness,” “promising,” reiterations of battlefield-turned-garden) borders on purple and introduces mild redundancy. The momentum remains intact, but occasional paraphrase loops and over-decorated lines could be tightened for greater force. Despite this, the prose still reads as above-average and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and mostly controlled, with high information density and vivid, multi-tasking images that build world and mood simultaneously. Some metaphoric choices verge on purple or redundant (repeating “translate distance into closeness,” “wild hush”) and could be trimmed for greater impact. Despite this, clarity is rarely compromised, and sentences generally carry forward character, setting, and theme at once. Rhythm and variation are strong enough that the occasional over-rich line doesn’t substantially dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is fluent and largely clear, but heavily ornamented: stacked metaphors and abstractions accumulate (“minutes stretched like taffy,” “glass cradle,” “echoed silence,” “universe waited with patient arms”), creating a purple haze that sometimes dilutes impact. Several sentences repeat or slightly rephrase ideas around time being pliable and maps of possibility, adding mild redundancy. Line-by-line, the piece maintains coherence and basic momentum, yet it rarely employs sharp, concrete strokes; nearly every line reaches for the same kind of loftiness, blunting contrast and force. Tightening figurative language and varying texture would significantly raise this score.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is polished, rhythmically pleasing, and dense with images; many sentences do double duty for mood and worldbuilding. That density sometimes tips into purple prose and repetition—multiple invocations of “cautious abandon,” “when the sky is wrong,” and stacked modifiers—so that individual images compete rather than sharpen focus. Still, clarity is maintained and there are few, if any, outright muddled or redundant lines that would require heavy editorial pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong information density and evocative metaphors that usually land cleanly. There is some purple-leaning accumulation (“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra,” “benevolently ruthless,” multiple breath/echo images) that risks over-saturating moments without adding new pressure. Still, clarity is never lost, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Overall momentum is maintained despite the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, sonically pleasing, and information-dense, with very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. The metaphoric layering (“labyrinthine bookstore,” “stone ribs,” “lungs of an ancient beast”) usually deepens mood rather than obscuring sense. However, the frequency of figurative language is high almost throughout, creating mild purple-prose pressure and making some images feel less special. A touch more sparseness or contrast at peak beats would sharpen impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluent, with few grammatical or clarity issues, and most sentences carry both atmosphere and character. The prose leans heavily into figurative language and abstraction (“soul to its purest form,” “banner of peace fluttering”), drifting toward purple at peaks and occasionally repeating concepts rather than adding new pressure. Still, information density is decent, scaffolding is minimal, and the closure image is legible. A firmer hand with cutting and a bit more concrete, scene-level texture would be necessary for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and generally precise, with many lines doing double duty for mood and theme (e.g., the spire “splitting [light] into shards of cold silver”). There is some repetition and near-paraphrasing of concepts (refracting truth, the price of forgiveness, echoes scattering/shattering) that edge toward purple and slightly slow momentum. Nonetheless, clarity remains good; syntax is clean, and the closure image is not obscured by figurative excess. Trimming a few redundant metaphors and abstract statements would raise density and make the strongest images stand out more.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, with clean syntax and vivid images that carry a lot of atmospheric weight; most sentences are doing multiple jobs. However, figurative language is very dense—almost every line carries a metaphor or extended image—creating moments of purple excess and slight redundancy (“quilt memories together,” “weaving a tapestry,” “tapestry of broken pieces”). Occasional explanatory phrases (“the philosophy that brokenness could become beautiful”) read more like gloss than necessary scene. Clarity survives, but a leaner line would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; many lines do double duty in setting mood and advancing the symbolic logic. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned, and there are few true paraphrase loops or clunky scaffolds. A handful of phrases veer toward purple or abstract (“intimate aloofness,” “temporary eternity” repeated, some overt summations of meaning), slightly dulling momentum in places. Still, clarity never collapses, and the final image—canvas “seemed to pulse” with the seashell’s eternity—is clean and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often musical, with some strong images (the lighthouse as a heart, light as a cascade of droplets). Yet figurative language is dense almost line-to-line, and key phrases and concepts (“vibrations of intent,” “whispers travel farther than shouts,” tenderness as a kind of shout) recur without adding new information, creating a sense of overwriting. Several sentences restate the same emotional content in slightly varied metaphors, which blunts momentum. Rhythm is generally smooth but could benefit from more restraint and variation to sharpen the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are often striking, and most lines do more than one job (world, mood, and theme together). There is some risk of purple prose and metaphor density, but the pattern is coherent and rarely confuses meaning (“dimmed to a bruise on new moons” is a good example of density that still lands cleanly). Momentum holds despite the lyric mode; there aren’t obvious paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. The lushness might benefit from a few leaner moments to sharpen contrast, but it doesn’t materially obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme without obvious scaffolding or loops. Imagery is often striking and coherent, and there are few, if any, outright muddled metaphors. At times the figurative language and abstract phrasing verge on purple or conceptual overload, especially when compounded with terms like “psychological safety” and “fractured grace,” which slightly dull momentum. Still, clarity holds throughout and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose frequently achieves striking images (“painting the sea with bruised lavender,” “ribbons of gold that whispered of memory”) and generally maintains clarity. Line-to-line, most sentences do multiple jobs—advancing mood, character, and concept simultaneously. However, figurative density is high and occasionally redundant, with certain motifs and adjectives repeated without new inflection, pushing toward mild purple prose. The momentum remains intact, but tighter pruning and a bit more plainness at key beats would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery (“scent of old parchment lingered like a memory of distant seas”) and good information density. At times it veers toward over-richness, repeating key terms (“lingering promise,” “doorway of decisions,” “glimmer”) and leaning on abstract constructions rather than concrete embodiment. Despite some purple edging, clarity remains intact and momentum doesn’t significantly stall. Line-level craft is clearly above-average but could benefit from selective pruning and more varied textures of simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is competent and often striking, with strong rhythmic control and layered imagery. However, figurative density is high nearly everywhere—multiple metaphors per sentence in places—leading to occasional purple-prose feel and softening impact (“bleeding starlight” and “shared exhale” recur without always adding new pressure). Some phrases verge on redundancy rather than progression of meaning. Clarity of action and closure survive, but a more selective, sculpted use of image would sharpen momentum and emotional punch.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and largely graceful, with some strong images (coals rising “like distant stars,” the shell humming with a heartbeat-like pulse). At the same time, abstraction and repetition (“revalue,” “density of presence,” “ember nexus at twilight”) create a mild sense of conceptual looping. Figurative language is frequent but not always adding new facets, drifting toward purple in places without increasing pressure. Information density is decent, but tighter pruning of repeated ideas would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology. The figurative language (“snow capped peaks stare like indifferent judges,” “tangled rope” of time) is mostly apt, though metaphor density is high and occasionally veers toward purple or conceptual repetition (“feral nostalgia,” jealousy of past selves restated). There are few true scaffolding lines or synonym loops, but some phrases tell what’s already implied (“my motivation remains clear”) and could be cut for tautness. The final cadence is clean and image-driven, preserving momentum through the close.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme, and the rhythm mostly supports the meditative mode. Nonetheless, the density of figurative language is high, with repeated conceptual frames (“mapping emotional terrain,” “emotional topography,” “ordinary miracles”) and some phrases that feel purple or redundant, slightly dulling impact. Despite that, clarity and momentum through the scene are maintained; the closure beat—fog lifting, water chiming, mother passing—is clean and not obscured by ornament. Trimming a few explanatory or near-duplicate lines would likely sharpen an already strong prose texture.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with rich imagery and a good sense of rhythm, and most sentences do more than one job. However, there are pockets of redundancy and awkwardness—“held that breath during a held breath” is tautological, and “She smiled softly brightly” reads as an unedited collision. Figurative density occasionally edges toward overwriting, slightly blurring precision in spots. These issues don’t obscure causality or closure, but they do keep the prose from feeling flawlessly cut.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line to line, the prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, character) at once. Some metaphor stacking (“each note that rose was a metaphor,” “imperfect miracles,” “cracked saint,” “ethereal grit”) risks purple overload and slightly blunts impact through saturation. Still, syntactic variety, clean grammar, and clear sequencing keep momentum intact; the closure image reads crisply despite lyricism. Trimming a few redundant figurative flourishes would likely elevate this to truly elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with high information density—many sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and concept. Some figurative saturation and phrase repetition (“resounding hush,” “spiral arbitration,” variants of “unify strands”) flirt with purple, but clarity and momentum are largely preserved. Syntax varies, and there are no major grammatical or logical stumbles. Line-level craft is strong but not razor-perfect for elite venues; a light prune would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and thought) and avoid obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; images like the gears as a heartbeat from the bedrock and the fjord as “silver glass” are clear and apt. There is light redundancy in concepts (breath, heartbeat, hum) but not enough to drag momentum or obscure the closure image. Overall, the prose feels polished and publication-ready with only minor opportunities for sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with smooth syntax and a good balance of description and action. There is some mild redundancy and abstraction (“quiet wildfire,” “invisible guardians,” “true catalyst for the quiet wildfire of progress”) that blunts impact and slightly slows momentum. Figurative language is mostly controlled but sometimes leans toward purple or conceptual rather than concrete. Tightening repetition and sharpening a few metaphors would markedly strengthen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, image-rich, and syntactically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Key phrases and motifs (clover melancholy, lucid contradictions, theoretically rebellious) repeat enough to verge on self-conscious, but not so much as to obscure meaning. Figurative language occasionally borders on purple yet remains intelligible, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though it could benefit from a touch more restraint and variation in imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and a good sense of sonic rhythm; many sentences do multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, and action) without obvious padding. There is some repetition and conceptual redundancy around loops, endings/beginnings, and estrangement that could be pared to sharpen impact. A few phrases drift purple or expository (“core concept of cultivated estrangement”) and tell what the images already imply. Still, clarity is maintained and the final lines land cleanly as an image and emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often gorgeous, with many sentences doing double-duty for mood and meaning, and rhythm that generally suits the meditative mode. Yet figurative language is nearly continuous, with repeated constructions (“steep,” “haunted euphoria,” “regenerated covenant”) and similar sensory cadences that risk synonym loops and purple overgrowth. A bit more syntactic and imagistic austerity—especially around the climax—would sharpen impact and vary the music. Clarity remains intact, but the ornamental excess does dampen momentum and keeps this just shy of elite readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: rhythms vary, imagery is concrete when anchored in the station and ivy, and most lines do more than one job (advancing image, mood, and theme together). There is some overreliance on abstract nouns and conceptual phrasing (“network of empathy,” “polite anarchy,” “imagined reciprocity”) that lightly dilutes immediacy but doesn’t derail momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent and not muddled. No major loops or scaffolding artifacts bog down the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatically clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, and many images (“pause of shifting constellations,” “frequencies too high for ordinary ears”) are striking. That said, metaphor and abstraction are heavily layered—nearly every line bears figurative weight—which edges toward purple and occasionally blurs immediacy. Some phrases paraphrase each other conceptually (quiet blaze / gentle fire / inner light) without adding new pressure. The prose is polished but could benefit from more spareness at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong sensory images and a good information-to-sentence ratio; many lines do double duty for setting and theme. However, figurative language is dense and sometimes repetitive (frequent returns to seeds, gardens, gravity, comfort) without consistently adding new facets. A few sentences paraphrase prior ideas (“edit history without erasing identity,” “editing history was less about control”) rather than advancing them, creating mild loopiness. Despite this, clarity and momentum are preserved, and there are no serious grammatical or logical missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clear, musical, and carefully structured, with strong images like “each ripple a silver sigh” and the harbor as a “living stave.” Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to obscure meaning, and sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical monotony. There is some redundancy in thematic phrasing (“mapping silence,” “turning absence into melody,” “beauty from void”) that could be tightened. Overall, line-level craft is solid and readable, though occasionally edging toward purple and explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.7)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double work for setting and theme. Metaphors (“murals spread like lava,” “dust danced like ash”) are coherent with the fire/volcano motif and do not contradict each other. There is mild overuse of similar imagery and adjectives (“bright and tender,” “heat of compassion,” “volcanic tenderness”), but it stops short of real purple prose or confusion. No significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony impede momentum or obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally polished: syntax varies, images are vivid, and the narrative flows smoothly without grammatical or referential confusion. Still, the prose leans into purple territory at times, stacking abstractions and metaphors (“auroral sorrow,” “tale…became a living chord that bounded the world together in hopeful sorrow”) in ways that repeat emotional content rather than sharpen it. Some sentences paraphrase or mildly echo prior ideas, slightly softening momentum. The writing is clearly above-average, but tightening and pruning would be needed for a truly premier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and economical, with strong concrete images (glowing creases, humming conduits, a seam splitting in the container wall). Sentences vary in length and structure, and most do double duty for atmosphere and action. There is some conceptual repetition around the storm’s “veins,” “currents,” and the labyrinth’s “steel veins,” plus occasional mildly ornate phrases that don’t add new information. Nonetheless, these are minor, and the line-level writing supports rather than obstructs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Metaphors generally cohere around water, light, and mirrors, creating a unified lexicon. That said, density is high—phrases like “stillwater tension,” “spiralingly calm,” and repeated invocations of secrets and shutters verge on purple and sometimes restate similar ideas. Momentum softens under this ornamental weight, but clarity and the closure image remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose offers many striking images (“dust danced like quiet fireflies,” “each unspoken word settle like a pawn awaiting promotion”) and generally clean syntax, with few mechanical errors. Yet figurative language is very dense, often stacked, and recurring motifs (quiet, mist, forests, second thoughts) are reiterated to the point of near-slogan, softening impact. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas of quiet rebellion and community awakening without adding new pressure. The line-level craft is above average but not yet pared or varied enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally fluent, with strong images (“bruised horizon,” “moon-struck daggers”) and a steady rhythm that carries the reader through the narrative. There is some repetition of key phrases (“combative tenderness,” “unlocking guarded hearts”) and a tendency toward stacked modifiers that approach purple but don’t fully obscure meaning. Information density is decent—most sentences add either atmosphere or forward motion—though several could be tightened without loss. No major syntactic or clarity errors intrude on the closure, but the lushness slightly dulls urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images like shavings “fall[ing] like snow in a world that no longer remembered winter” and turbines singing a “low hymn.” Information density is decent and most sentences do multiple jobs. That said, the language occasionally verges on repetitive and abstract (e.g., multiple formulations of carving lightness from sorrow and remaking hush), and some lines slide into thematic telling rather than sharp image. The purple-tinged repetitions slightly dull momentum but do not obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is lush and generally well-crafted, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme; rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony. There is some paraphrase and conceptual repetition around boundaries dissolving, trembling air, and the tremor/pulse of certainty, which slightly bloats the piece. Figurative density borders on purple in places, but metaphors are mostly coherent and tonally aligned. Momentum softens rather than stalls, keeping this solid but short of elite-line precision.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and imagistic with good rhythm, and most metaphors are coherent and sensorially grounded, giving the piece strong line-level appeal. However, figurative density is very high throughout, with frequent similar constructions (whispers, glow, hum, awakenings) that occasionally blur impact and verge on purple. There is some conceptual redundancy around imperfection, cracks, and awakening that could be tightened without loss. Despite this, clarity remains intact and key images—like the final glass flowers—land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and imagistic, often doing multiple jobs at once by advancing scene, worldbuilding, and theme. Key metaphors (light as audible color, memory as ribbons, connection as texture) are coherent and sensorially grounded. However, there is notable repetition of phrases (“texture of connection,” “golden shadows,” “artificial pilgrimage”) and a near-constant figurative density that occasionally verges on purple, slightly blurring emphasis and slowing momentum. Despite this, clarity is maintained and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with dense but mostly lucid imagery and effective cadence shifts at key moments (e.g., the rose’s phosphorescent awakening). Sentences often do double duty—world-building and emotional shading—without obvious scaffolding or syntactic monotony. However, the figurative layer is nearly continuous, and concepts like “curtains of intention” and “genuinely artificial” are reiterated and re-explained, flirting with overwriting. Trimming a few explanatory lines would sharpen momentum and let the best images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: high information density, varied imagery, and clean mechanics. Some metaphors are genuinely striking (“markets lay shattered like glass,” the droplet reflecting a miniature universe), and most sentences do multiple jobs. There is some redundancy and purple tilt—e.g., reiterations of the same conceptual moves about measuring, mapping, and inherited mystery—that slightly slow momentum. Still, clarity holds throughout, and no figurative muddle damages the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable, with few if any grammatical issues and a generally smooth rhythmic flow. The prose does real atmospheric work, but leans toward repetition (“atoms of nostalgia,” “anguished joy,” full phrase “bronze prism pagoda at twilight”) and a touch of purple, where several adjacent sentences carry similar figurative weight without always adding new information. This density occasionally feels ornamental rather than propulsive, slightly dragging momentum in a short piece. Nonetheless, clarity of action and emotional throughline are never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with several lines doing double duty for setting and theme (e.g., shelves “like the ribs of a great wing”). Yet there is clear tendency toward purple repetition and abstraction—phrases like “softly deliberate,” “luminous regret,” and multiple mentions of “hope” and “shadow unbound” recur without always adding new nuance. Some sentences paraphrase the same insight in slightly different terms, which dampens momentum. Line-by-line clarity remains intact, but a leaner, more image-driven draft would read stronger at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and emotion. There is some repetition and mild purple-prose drift—phrases like “shimmering stillness,” “quietly vivid,” and repeated mist imagery begin to feel ornamental rather than always load-bearing. A few lines paraphrase the same idea (reconstruction, balance) in slightly different metaphors without adding new pressure. Still, clarity is never lost, and momentum, though gentle, is not significantly impeded.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) with good density. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and certain motifs (“meteor hush,” “displaced miracle”) risk feeling over-insisted, edging toward purple in places. There is minor redundancy in restating similar insights about scars and time, though it doesn’t significantly obscure causality or closure. Overall momentum survives, but a leaner deployment of metaphor would sharpen impact for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line by line, the writing is vivid and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. The metaphoric density is high (“spatially imaginative labyrinth,” “projection lens turning into a telescope that surveyed the inner universe of emotions”), but the figures usually cohere rather than clash. There is some accumulation of abstractions and elaborate images that could be pared without loss, which slightly flattens momentum. Still, clarity is preserved and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “verses that never reached sunrise”). There is some figurative density and echoing phrasing (“shadowed rapture,” “stardust memory,” “unwritten calendar”) that veers toward purple and occasionally feels redundant rather than escalating. Syntax variety is adequate, though the uniformly high lyricism can slow momentum and blur distinctions between beats. Nonetheless, cause/effect and closure remain clear, and there are no major mechanical issues.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and often beautiful, with dense image work that usually remains coherent and legible. However, figurative language is stacked in many consecutive sentences and motifs are repeated in near-identical form, edging into purple and creating mild redundancy. Information density is good but could improve with a few sharper cuts to repeated concepts. The closure image remains clear and strong, so the stylistic excess doesn’t materially harm understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and often striking, with many sentences doing dual work for image and theme. That said, figurative density is high and occasionally redundant (“each note a thread to unravel,” “unraveling the knots”) and some phrases feel like slight paraphrase loops rather than new pressure. The lone grammatical slip (“translocates”) and a few near-generic abstractions (“pure possibility”) nick the overall effect. The piece reads smooth and publishable with trimming, but not yet at the razor-sharp concision expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is polished and mostly clear, with smooth syntax and few if any grammatical issues. Many sentences pull double duty for mood and information, and the read-aloud rhythm is workable. That said, there is some repetition of full phrases and concepts (“ticket punch with star stamp,” courage as a seed, lullaby imagery), and figurative language occasionally verges on soft-focus (“veiled ridgeway,” “unused courage waits”) without adding new precision. The prose is solidly publishable but not yet as lean or surprising as the most demanding markets typically require.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with relatively few outright redundancies or confusing constructions. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent, and information density is high. That said, several sentences stack abstractions (“frostbitten hope,” “unspoken agreement,” “unpardable silence”) in close proximity, creating mild overload and a sense of sameness in cadence. Line-level craft is strong but not spare or razor-precise enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lush and largely precise, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning (“as if the temple itself mourned the lie that had held it together”). Rhythm is varied and most images are coherent, though figurative density occasionally drifts toward purple without adding new pressure. There’s some conceptual repetition (truth vs. deceit, the same motifs restated in similar terms) but not enough to stall momentum. Line-level craft is clearly above average and never obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level work is generally clean, rhythmical, and efficient; sentences often do double duty for setting and theme. There is some repetition of key phrases and structures, but it reads as intentional motif more than careless looping. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though terms like “periodically eternal” and “drifting moored” feel slightly overused and risk blunting impact. Momentum holds throughout despite the reflective mode, with no major scaffolding or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is vivid and often elegant, packing multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) into single sentences. However, figurative density is high throughout—“thunderous serenity,” “key forged from starlight and steel,” “quiet blaze”—and the accumulation occasionally feels purple, softening impact. There are minor redundancies of concept and phrase, and some abstractions could be sharpened into more concrete images. Despite this, clarity and forward momentum remain intact, and there are no major scaffolding or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and forward motion) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery—“tail fluttering like a broken prayer,” “script glimmered like mineral veins”—is vivid and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors despite a high figurative density. There are mild repetitions (“reconstruction,” “destiny”) and occasional generalized abstractions, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image. Overall, the prose is clean, legible, and rhythmically varied enough for a demanding venue, though it stops short of formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally precise, evocative, and well-paced, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and emotion (“edges frayed like the coastline”). Rhythm is varied and there are few, if any, syntactic or grammatical slips. Some phrases repeat conceptually (“anchor optimism in realism,” “somatic markers,” “pearl of stillness”) in ways that start to feel didactic rather than deepening, and a few abstractions dilute the otherwise strong imagery. It’s strong, publishable prose that could be tightened by stripping the most explanatory lines.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and evocative imagery; many lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is dense and somewhat repetitive—threads, light/shadow, luminescence, walls closing—producing moments of purple saturation that could be tightened for greater impact. A few sentences restate similar ideas (brokenness as potential, darkness as necessary) in slightly different metaphors, leading to minor momentum drag rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid imagery and a rhythm that suits the contemplative, ritualistic scene. At times, metaphors and abstractions stack (“vapor of memory,” “fragile tapestry of existence,” “ink of history”) in ways that risk purple excess and minor redundancy. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained; causality and spatial relations are never obscured, and most sentences do more than one job. Tighter pruning of repeated conceptual language would sharpen momentum and lift the piece closer to publish-ready polish.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, often striking (“a ripple through the dormant networks like a shiver traveling down a frozen spine”) and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and theme. Nonetheless, it tends toward density and repetition—variations on “quiet,” “echo,” “dormant networks,” “contraband truths,” and “scandalize” reappear without always adding new pressure. Some metaphors feel overdetermined (voices as shards of ice cracking frozen silence, the library as tomb then lighthouse, snow melting to green shoots), tipping into the didactic. Despite tendencies toward overwriting, clarity and momentum mostly hold, especially given the accumulative, lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains some striking images (thorns “sheathed in moonlight,” the dome breathing “a sunrise of amber fire”) and generally clean syntax, but it suffers from repetition and mild purple tendencies. Key phrases and concepts recur with little modulation (“tranquil blaze,” “weave continuity through chaos,” “engraved quiet,” “weight” as metaphor), creating paraphrase loops rather than intensification. Abstractions are often stacked on top of one another, slightly dulling impact and momentum. Line-level craft is solid but not sharp or surprising enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is lush and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and world-building. Yet figurative language is nearly continuous, leading to moments of saturation and conceptual overlap (e.g., sound waves as flowers, chords, threads, tides, birds) that start to blur precision. Certain phrases and structures recur (“patterns break themselves and reassemble,” “sleepwalking constellations”), edging into mild redundancy rather than intentional patterning. A bit more spareness and contrast in texture would sharpen the strongest images and improve momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the figurative language is mostly coherent and voice-appropriate. There is some density—metaphors stacked in close proximity—but it stops short of obscuring clarity or momentum. Repetition of motifs (ink, pages, orbits) builds pattern rather than feeling like scaffold or synonym churn. Line-level control is high, though a slightly leaner execution around peak beats could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is imaginative and often beautiful, with many lines doing double duty for mood and world-building. Yet figurative language is nearly continuous, and certain phrases and concepts recur with minimal added pressure (“when time folds in on itself,” “meteor hush,” generalized “sorrow”), creating a sense of mild overwriting. Some sentences summarize big turns in abstract terms instead of letting concrete action carry them, which blunts momentum. The line craft is above-average but held back from elite tier by density and a bit of thematic and syntactic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is lush and mostly clear, with strong metaphorical texture and few outright confusions, and it achieves a consistent sonic and imagistic pattern. However, figurative density is very high—“lilac unease,” “emergent hush,” “captured sigh,” “pastel peace”—in nearly every line, which edges into purple and occasionally dulls impact. There are mild repetition and paraphrase tendencies, and some abstractions could be pared without loss. Line-level craft is solid but not as ruthlessly precise and varied as elite venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the rhythm reads well aloud. However, the density of figurative language and recurring constructions (“chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone,” “warm coldness”) borders on purple and mildly slows momentum. There are minor paraphrase echoes about mercy, steel, and ash that could be tightened. Clarity at the climax and closure remains intact despite this richness.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally fluent and image-dense, with many sentences doing double-duty for mood and world-building. There is some repetition of favored terms (“echo,” “luminous,” “glowed”) and a tendency toward piled modifiers that verge on purple but don’t obscure sense. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to keep momentum, and action beats are easy to follow. Tightening a few metaphor stacks and abstract turns of phrase would sharpen impact at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is polished, syntactically varied, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. However, figurative density (“fractally precise,” “willowglass,” “hidden pathways,” “light painted in hope”) is high and occasionally borders on purple, with slight conceptual redundancy across adjacent lines. Momentum is decent for a lyric piece but could be sharper with a few trims to repeated ideas. Clarity remains intact, and there are no major grammatical or structural errors.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush but generally disciplined: most sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and concept) without obvious redundancy or confusion. Figurative language is sustained and coherent—stones hearing quiet, droplets as lanterns, veins aligning with mineral filaments—without mixing metaphors to the point of muddling sense. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece; there are no major paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases that could be easily cut. A few abstractions (“hidden grief,” “factually mystical”) approach conceptual vagueness but are anchored quickly enough in image not to impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and imagistic, with good information density—most sentences do atmospheric, thematic, and narrative work at once. A few phrases recur or edge toward abstraction (“raw possibility,” “quietly inspired anew,” “as the truth unravels”), creating mild echo and a slight sense of purple drift. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved; cause/effect and visual logic remain legible through the climax and closing image. Line-level craft is solid but not ruthlessly pruned or surprising enough for elite-tier lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is fluent and clear, with few if any grammatical or syntactic errors, and many sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is dense and occasionally repetitive (“silver hush,” “map of redemption,” “unused courage waits”), verging on purple in places. Some lines paraphrase or echo prior content without adding new pressure, and a lighter touch would sharpen impact. Momentum holds, but the lyric saturation slightly blunts the climax’s force.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally fluent, with strong imagery and some lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., tying fog, memory, and palimpsest together). However, figurative density is high—“spindrift serenity,” “percolate,” “palimpsest,” and stitching metaphors reappear frequently, sometimes reiterating the same idea rather than advancing it. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase one another’s insights about layering and serenity, softening momentum. Despite this slight purple tendency, clarity and cadence remain intact, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept—e.g., “The sun rose over the cracked dunes like a careful sigh” neatly sets tone and world. There is occasional purple-leaning density (“sharp gentleness,” “phototropic to kindness,” “as chimney smoke flattens across the horizon”) and some conceptual repetition, but clarity is rarely compromised. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanically patterned. Trimming a few abstractions and slightly mixed metaphors would elevate the prose to a more austere, elite-literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with few outright redundancies or syntactic stumbles, and it carries atmosphere effectively. Nonetheless, there is a noticeable density of similar metaphors (silver, glow, ribbons, argent, luminous) that can blur impact and edge toward purple. Several lines restate the same emotional state in slightly varied language (the hush, vulnerability, harbor’s acceptance), generating mild paraphrase loops. Tightening these repetitions and varying imagery would sharpen momentum and preserve the strongest lines.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is polished and generally clear, with strong information density—most sentences carry image, mood, and conceptual weight simultaneously. There is some redundancy and near-looping, especially in repeated phrases like “atomically reflective surface” and “brittle awakenings,” and the figurative density approaches purple at times without always deepening pressure. Still, syntax is controlled, grammar clean, and the closure image is not obscured by ornament. Tightening a few repetitive formulations and varying texture around peak beats would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is strong, with vivid imagery and mostly clean syntax; sentences generally carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and thematic echo) without losing clarity. There is a tendency toward over-saturation of figurative language and repetition of certain motifs and adjectives, which nudges the prose toward purple in places and risks diminishing impact. Nonetheless, there are few true redundancies or scaffolding sentences, and the closure image remains clear. Tightening modifiers and pruning a few echoing phrases would raise this to truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lines like “The night air…hummed with restless static” and “casting ethereal grit across the campus and beyond” show an ear for rhythm and image. The prose is generally clean and propulsive, with few true artifacts or syntactic stumbles. Yet there is noticeable repetition of concepts (hope, power plays, unity) and a tendency toward abstract phrasing over concrete dramatization, especially in the back half. Some sentences edge into purple or explanatory, modestly reducing momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally clear, and densely packed with meaning, often doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Some metaphors are striking (“walls close like a familiar wound”), and repetition around mutiny, rebellion, and resonance forms a deliberate pattern rather than pure redundancy. That said, there is a mild tendency toward purple prose and stacked abstractions, especially near peaks, which slightly blur immediacy and physicality. These issues are minor and do not materially obscure causality or the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The line-level writing is generally fluent and rhythmically controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for image and mood. Yet there is clear overwriting: repeated formulations of “unifying opposites,” “dormant empathy,” “lance of compassion,” and multiple near-synonymous descriptions of mist and hush create a sense of paraphrase loops. Several metaphors (stone lancing, empathy as a flame, silence as a blanket) stack rather than refine, occasionally blurring impact. Tightening repetition and pruning a few abstract restatements would significantly sharpen momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rich with concrete and figurative detail, and generally carry multiple functions (setting, mood, theme) without padding. Metaphors like “glint like a captured heartbeat” and “coat stitched from hope and dread” are vivid and coherent, with only occasional flirtation with purple. There are no noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences, and the prose maintains momentum across the scene. Minor density in figurative language during calmer beats doesn’t significantly blur sense or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluent, with vivid images and competent rhythm, but metaphors and abstractions are heavily stacked (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’,” “lullaby for futures that had never been imagined,” “luminous disbelief”). This density edges toward purple prose and occasionally feels like thematic restatement rather than new information. Some phrasing and motifs loop without added pressure, which softens momentum. Clarity remains intact, yet a sharper, more selective line-edit would significantly elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are varied, images precise, and many lines do double duty for mood and theme (e.g., the notes “fluttering in the wind” at the end). Repetition of certain favored terms (“dusky,” “polished calm,” “meteoric rise”) brushes against purple but doesn’t tip into clutter. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym loops; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. The main constraint on a higher score is a vein of explicit philosophizing that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp, imagistic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, syntactically varied, and rich in sensory detail; many sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and theme. That said, figurative language is dense and occasionally repetitive (“midnight solace,” “burden lift,” “heal with words,” similar star metaphors) leading to moments of purple, and there are a few near-paraphrase lines about burdens being lifted and healed. The lack of sharper contrast or plainer beats around key turns slightly dulls their impact. Overall, line craft is solid but could be trimmed and diversified to reach elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with many lines doing atmospheric and thematic work simultaneously, and the sequence of images is generally clear. However, figurative density is very high—metaphors in nearly every sentence create a slight purple haze that can blunt impact (“cape collapses like a wounded bird,” “each leaf shimmering like a sword unsheathed in peace,” etc.). There are minor redundancies and abstractions (“warlike serenity” repeated, some summary of purpose) that could be trimmed for sharpness. Strong, but would need tightening for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often effective at doing multiple jobs—advancing action while sustaining atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent, and there are few true muddles or syntactic stumbles. The main issues are mild overwriting and conceptual redundancy (e.g., repeated formulations around “intersection of dreams,” “covenant’s promise,” “anxious elation”) that slightly slow momentum and risk blur. Still, line-level control is solid enough that clarity and closure remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, with clean grammar and a strong sensibility for image and cadence; many lines do double duty for mood and world-building. Yet the density of figurative language (“roots…like dark veins,” “bones aligning like verses in an ancient poem,” “inlaying meaning everywhere”) borders on repetitive, and some phrases recur without adding new information. This produces a mild purple-prose feel and a sense of synonym churn around void/meaning/hope that blunts impact. Trimming a few near-duplicate formulations and varying the texture would significantly heighten the existing strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level prose is generally polished, with strong sensory images and multi-tasking sentences that advance mood and character simultaneously. Nonetheless, there is a tendency toward purple/stacked metaphor and conceptual repetition (echoes, applause, purpose, rebirth) that can feel slightly overinsistent. A few lines paraphrase the same interior realization in different abstractions, softening momentum and impact. The ending still lands clearly, but a leaner, more image-driven approach would better serve the material.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Some metaphor density and repetition (“analogical thinking,” “bridge,” “harmony,” “ambition”) verge on purple or redundant, but they don’t seriously obscure sense. There are no major syntactic or grammatical issues, and momentum, while meditative, does not stall. Trimming a few explanatory phrases and tightening recurring concepts would heighten sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and efficient sentence-level work that usually accomplishes multiple tasks (world-building, mood, and theme) simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and pattern-consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors or obvious loops, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A few phrases verge on purple (“a beacon for those who would seek wonder in the mundane”), yet they don’t materially blur sense or stall momentum. There is little scaffolding or redundancy, and the closing lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatical, cadence is varied, and images are coherent and legible. The prose often multitasks, combining setting, emotion, and theme in compact lines, and there is little outright redundancy or scaffolding. That said, figurative language is nearly constant and in a similar register, edging into mild purple prose and dulling impact through repetition of glow/hush/heart imagery. The lack of sharper, plainer counterpoints keeps the piece from feeling as taut and precise as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally beautiful, with high information density: images often carry atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the tape as “a memory,” the ivy as “curtains”). Rhythm and sentence variety mostly support a flowing, meditative pace, and clarity is rarely in doubt despite the figurative richness. However, metaphor density is very high across the whole piece, flirting with purple and creating a mild sense of sameness; some lines and concepts (maps, “daringly methodical,” raw solace) are reiterated in near-paraphrase. Trimming a few redundant or thesis-like sentences would sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical with few if any outright clunkers, and most sentences do at least one piece of work. There is a tendency toward purple, with stacked abstractions and similar structures (“halos that danced like murmurs of forgotten verses,” “a choir of silent letters sang”) producing a slightly uniform, floaty rhythm. Some motifs and phrases repeat without added pressure (e.g., “cautious exuberance,” explanations of propagation delays), which could be trimmed. Line-level craft is solid but not yet razor-honed or maximally efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional shading. Metaphors are generally coherent and nicely patterned (ice, frost, perforation, vines, iron), creating a strong textural fabric. There is some risk of purple prose and motif repetition—“mulberry ache,” “perforated destiny,” and similar constructions recur—but they stop short of obscuring sense or stalling momentum. Line-level craft is clearly above-average and nearly publication-ready, though a demanding editor would likely trim a few decorative phrases for maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative rhythms and high information density; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept. However, there is some redundancy and purple tilt—repeated invocations of hush, stillness, and aurora, and a tendency to stack abstractions (“covenant with the universe,” “tapestry of existence”). These choices occasionally soften momentum and clarity, especially near the end where commentary accumulates. Line-level craft is solid enough for publication, but would benefit from tightening and pruning of the more ornamental phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are mostly clean and rhythmic, with good sensory density and no glaring grammatical issues. A few images verge on purple or repetitive, and some lines restate similar ideas about cycles, hush, and contentment without adding pressure. Still, most prose does at least two jobs (mood + character, or setting + theme) and maintains momentum for a lyric piece. It’s polished and readable but not yet at the razor-honed precision expected in elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong sensory images and a clear rhythmic ear—wind, stone, light, and metal are rendered in clean, evocative lines. At times, metaphor and abstraction stack (“cloak of doubt,” “portal for future doubts,” “prism of possibility”) to the edge of purple, slightly diluting immediacy. There are minor redundancies in thematic phrasing, but no major loops or syntactic artifacts that obstruct clarity or closure. Overall, sentences do multiple jobs, but a tighter edit could heighten pressure by trimming conceptual repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus theme) and very few genuine clarity issues. Recurrent images (“sycamore hush,” tides, magnetism, ripples) generally reinforce rather than dilute, though the density of figurative language sometimes approaches purple and risks slight redundancy. There are minor paraphrase echoes (e.g., repeating the lesson of withholding/patience in similar terms), but they don’t materially stall momentum or obscure the closure image. Overall, line-level craft is strong, if occasionally over-ornamented for the relatively low-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong rhythm and rich imagery; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept. However, there is some repetition (“weathered resolve,” “pulse left wandering,” “centuries of dust”) and a mild purple tendency where figurative density risks redundancy rather than sharpness. Momentum is mostly maintained, but occasional near-paraphrases could be tightened for greater impact. Line-level craft is solid and often striking, but not at the razor-honed level demanded by the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the read-aloud rhythm is mostly smooth. However, key phrases and constructions recur (“lingering luminance,” “accommodates impossibilities,” variants of “quiet brilliance,” “brilliant dimness”), creating a sense of mild synonym-looping and self-conscious motif rather than organic progression. Figurative density is high enough that a few lines flirt with purple, though they don’t collapse clarity. Trimming some redundant metaphors and abstractions would significantly sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that generally pull in the same metaphoric direction (light, water, sound as color). Most sentences do at least two jobs—advancing action while thickening atmosphere—and there are few obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The density of figurative language comes close to purple in places, but clarity remains intact and the closure image is clean. A slight trim of modifiers and metaphors in mid-story would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally lucid and rhythmically pleasing, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, metaphor and abstraction are dense and frequent (“stellar doubt,” “backwards prophecy,” “chorus of the cosmos”), creating occasional purple patches and a sense of repetition rather than escalation. Some sentences slightly rephrase the same emotional state (doubt vs purpose vs alignment) without adding new pressure or image. Despite this, causality remains clear and the closure image is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally excellent: rich images (“cloak dripping with the sighs of unkept promises,” “dust motes into tiny prisms”) do multiple jobs and sustain mood. The prose stays clear despite density, with few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, occasionally edging toward saturation and softening impact, and a few abstractions (“echo of sacrifice” repeated, “distant intimacy”) are leaned on rather than freshly embodied. The line work is publishable-level strong, but slight purple excess keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“stretched like a frozen river of light,” “shards of sky”) and good information density—most sentences advance both scene and atmosphere. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are few if any genuine artifacts or loops. Occasionally the language borders on purple and repeats key conceptual phrases (“brittle devotion,” “lukewarm magic”) a bit too often, softening impact. Overall, though, clarity and cadence remain high.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a good density of multi-purpose lines that build both mood and meaning. Recurring images (silver ribbon ridgeway, mirrored hush, sapphire label) give the piece a cohesive texture. At times the language leans toward purple and repetitive (hush/mirror/water reflections recur heavily), but clarity is never lost and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym churn. Tightening a few over-articulated insights would bring it closer to elite-level line work.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is rich and often striking (“kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “phosphorescent snow,” “ancient freshness”). Yet figurative language is packed into almost every sentence, creating occasional purple density and diminishing the impact of individual images. There are mild redundancies in describing wonder and balance that could be tightened for more propulsion. Clarity remains intact, but some pruning would be needed for publication at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with clean syntax, few redundancies, and images that often do double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is quite dense and occasionally repetitive (multiple “echo,” “soundless,” and rhythm metaphors), flirting with purple prose without always deepening the moment. Information flow is clear, and there are no major scaffolding or clarity issues. A slight trim of repeated motifs could sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose features strong images (“ink in water,” “numbness cracking like ice under a sunrise”) and generally efficient sentences that advance both scene and atmosphere. There is some repetition and mild purple-tilt—“slice through pretense” and “complementary opposites” recur a bit mechanically—and a few explanatory lines could be cut without loss. Still, rhythm is varied, grammar clean, and cause-effect remains clear; metaphors don’t contradict each other or obscure action. The line-level work is above-average and publication-ready with a tightening pass, but lacks the polish and compression of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence-level craft is mostly smooth, with pleasing cadences and a good sense of when to linger on an image and when to move. Information density is decent: many lines do double duty building both atmosphere and concept. That said, the prose occasionally tips into purple with stacked metaphors and slightly redundant intensifiers, which soften impact rather than sharpening it (“a fragrance that seemed to rewrite the night itself,” “map of constellations drawn in vapor”). There are no major clarity problems or loops, just a mild tendency to gild already-strong moments.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is lush and often striking, and many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme, but figurative language is very dense—“macerate,” “blade of sound,” “ash humming with possibility”—to the point of occasional overload. Several metaphors stack or echo in ways that feel repetitive rather than deepening, and a few lines restate already-established ideas with slightly different imagery. Despite this, causality and closure remain clear; the ornamentation decorates rather than obscures the core action. Tightening and pruning some metaphoric clusters would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with imagery; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept. There is a tendency toward repetition of certain abstractions (“veil of sleep,” “boundaries of light,” “interiorizing exteriors”) and a high ratio of figurative language, which occasionally feels like ornamental layering rather than necessary pressure. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, and the closing cadence is clean and legible. Tightening a few conceptual redundancies would lift this to a more elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with clear syntax, clean grammar, and a good ratio of image to action; many lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative density is high and sometimes repetitive (“frozen bloom,” “penny dropped,” “silent promise,” “twilight glow”), risking a touch of purple and occasional redundancy. The rhythm leans on similar sentence structures and parallelism, which can blur individual moments rather than sharpen them. Despite this, the central beats and closure image remain clear and propulsive enough for solid publication-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding + mood + action), and the rhythm alternates between lush and functional in a controlled way. Some repetition (“serenely electric,” “beginning in every ending,” “shard of hush”) verges on overinsistence, and a few abstractions (“practical magic,” “fantasies could be engineered”) feel like scaffolding rather than image. Still, clarity is never compromised, there are no obvious loops or mechanical cadences, and figurative language, while rich, is not incoherent. The prose could be tightened slightly to avoid thematic restatement in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and readable, with some attractive images (“lattice of sound,” “silver coin into the grotto’s pool”). Sentence variety is decent and momentum holds across the scene. However, there is noticeable repetition of certain phrases and a tendency toward stacked abstractions (“interconnected patterns of intention and sound,” “bridge across worlds”) that slightly dilute sharpness. The line-level never collapses, but it rarely feels ruthlessly precise.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and images that often do more than one job (world-building plus theme). Some phrases are genuinely striking, and the rhythm carries the reader forward without major stumbling. However, figurative language is almost constant, and a few constructions (“realistically imaginary,” reiterated explanations of connection) feel redundant or verge on purple. Trimming repeated conceptual statements and varying texture with a few plainer beats would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and image-rich, with strong noun/verb choices and integrated worldbuilding. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing (e.g., restating the symbolic meaning of the anchor link instead of trusting the images) and a few conceptual phrases that feel coined for the prompt rather than arising naturally. Still, sentences usually do more than one job and maintain momentum. Line-level craft is solid, if not yet stripped to the precision expected at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically attentive, with many lines doing double duty in setting mood and advancing action. Metaphors are frequent but usually coherent and voice-consistent, and there are few genuine clunkers or confusions. That said, density of figurative language is high enough that it occasionally feels ornamental (“wept marble tears,” “cartographer of sighs,” “reeling hush”), softening momentum and impact. Trimming a few redundant or decorative images would sharpen the piece and push it closer to publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and images are often striking without collapsing into confusion. There is noticeable figurative stacking (“as if the ocean itself had inhaled and held its breath,” “jellyfish bellies lit from within”) that occasionally edges toward purple and could be pruned for greater impact. Repetition of certain constructs (“crashing hush,” tide imagery) verges on loop but doesn’t materially obscure causality or the final image. Overall, prose carries atmosphere and information with reasonable economy, though tightening would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax and a strong ear for cadence; most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing both image and concept. Some passages lean toward purple, stacking metaphors and modifiers (“shimmering cascade of code,” “fleeting sigils,” “crystalline whispers”) in quick succession, which risks density over sharpness. Still, clarity of action and causality remains intact, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding lines. The final beats land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but mostly precise, with figurative language that is coherent and thematically aligned (echoes as chorus, birds as punctuation, resonance as “audible sculpture”). Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world logic, or the central action without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. While the uniform lushness edges close to purple at times, it doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure. Line-level craft is publication-ready, though a touch more variation in plain vs. ornate sentences could sharpen peaks and valleys of emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is lush and imagistic, with strong moments (“light that fell like snowflakes, each one humming the same untamed harmony”) and good rhythmic variation. However, there is noticeable repetition of favored phrases and concepts (frost, harmony untamed, gravitationally playful, cosmic joke) without each return adding new pressure, which creates a mild sense of redundancy and sentimentality. A few lines verge on purple or meta-poetic summary, slowing momentum and telling what has just been shown. Despite this, clarity is maintained and line-level errors are minimal, making the piece readable and often striking, if not yet ruthlessly precise.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with clean syntax, clear sequencing, and multi-function sentences that both paint and advance the scene. Imagery like roots breaking metal-reinforced soil and golden insects as “living notes” is effective and memorable. There is some tendency toward repetition and purple phrasing—especially around heart rhythms, “resonantly soft,” and generalized abstractions like “tarnished wonder”—which slightly dulls momentum. Still, clarity remains intact, and line-level excess never fully obscures cause/effect or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and often striking, with many sentences doing dual work for atmosphere and action. However, figurative language is dense—neon, storms, borders, voids, and promises are repeatedly re-invoked—creating a mild purple-prose feel and some paraphrase loops of theme. Phrases like “brittle hush” recur without always adding new pressure, and several sentences restate the same conceptual point. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no serious syntactic or logical stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains many striking images and demonstrates strong rhythmic control at the sentence level. Yet figurative density is very high, with repeated motifs and similar constructions (“like,” “as”) that occasionally veer toward purple and create slight saturation. There is some conceptual redundancy (silence-as-possibility, whispering gleam, misting hush restated in varied phrasings) that could be tightened without loss. Despite this, clarity of action and closure remains intact, and most lines still carry narrative or atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, largely free of redundancy, and carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and concept) at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme (hyperbolic space, Möbius strip, lattice of verses), giving the prose a consistent texture. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence is metaphorically loaded—which slightly dulls momentum in what is already a low-conflict piece. Still, there are no major artifacts, and the final images land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a high density of concrete, sensory images that mostly carry their weight. Metaphoric language is frequent but usually coherent and on-theme, and paragraphs generally advance mood, world, or conceptual stakes without obvious scaffolding. That said, the saturation of luminous/sea/absence metaphors occasionally verges on purple and can blur distinct beats, and a few sentences restate prior ideas in slightly different words. The closure image remains clear and charged despite this mild excess.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with varied sentence lengths and few grammatical slips, and many lines do double-duty for mood and motion. However, figurative density is high and often repetitive—cosmic sighs, veils, tapestries, hums—so images blur rather than clarify. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same emotional state (“hummed with possibilities,” “hush of cosmic possibility,” “humming with potential”), softening momentum. The line-level craft is competent and occasionally lovely but veers into purple, keeping it below elite flash standards.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion) and relatively few true redundancies. However, figurative language and modifiers are nearly constant, pushing toward purple in places and slightly dulling impact through uniform intensity. The repeated maxim about habits and rituals feels like a small paraphrase loop of the same idea. Line-level craft is solid and above-average, but strategic pruning would heighten clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and images that often do double duty for mood and theme (e.g., the swing’s “soft metallic hymn” echoing her pen). Line-level clarity is maintained despite the lyrical density; causality and physical action remain legible. However, there is some purple and conceptual repetition—phrases like “reversible exile,” “combative tenderness,” and generalized abstractions about resilience recur in ways that slightly dilute impact. A touch more concision and occasional grounding in bodily sensation would elevate it to elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lines are generally grammatical, clear, and dense with imagery; many sentences do double duty for mood and world-building. Yet the prose frequently tips into purple, with stacked modifiers and metaphor chains (“mist like liquid amber,” “radiant hush,” “waterfall’s misty sigh”) that blur sharpness and slow momentum. Lexical repetition (especially “succor,” “radiant hush,” “color of wonder”) feels more like a loop than a deliberate, tightening motif. Trimming redundancies and varying the figurative texture would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and image-rich, with good information density. There is some repetition of conceptual terrain (hush, starlight, breathing walls) and a touch of purple-prose risk, but it does not seriously obscure sense. Metaphors are mostly coherent and aligned with the established imagery system. Tightening a few near-duplicate gestures would sharpen momentum without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept, and the rhythm generally sustains momentum despite its lyricism. There is some repetition of conceptual language (“shielded openness,” “silence,” “whispered chapel”) and occasional near-purple intensities, but metaphors remain coherent and support clarity. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and few outright clunky lines. However, there is a tendency toward purple repetition and conceptual restatement (e.g., multiple variations on loss, letting go, and transformation) that could be tightened. Some metaphors verge on overworked—“a gentle equation: tension minus attachment...” feels more clever than necessary—and the density of figurative language occasionally slows momentum. Despite this, clarity is maintained and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and imagistic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“between lightning and thunder, the sky pulsed like a living circuit”). There is some density of figurative language, but metaphors are thematically aligned and largely clear, avoiding major mixed-imagery muddle. Momentum holds surprisingly well for such a lyric piece, with few genuine paraphrase loops. A touch of trimming could sharpen impact, yet the line-level craft is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often graceful, with strong, concrete images like “crystal jars…vibrating with a soft glow that pulsed in rhythm with his own heartbeat.” At times, modifiers and figurative language accumulate (“like a frozen lighthouse,” “like a frozen helix,” “like warm sunrise”) in ways that risk mild purple prose and repetition. Some concepts (scattered light, affectionate detachment) are reiterated more than they are deepened, leading to slight redundancy. Nevertheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and sentences generally do more than one job.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, often doing double duty for setting and theme (“dust‑laden starlight fell like ash, coating the world below in a soft, amber hush”). It mostly avoids true muddle, but there is some purple accumulation and repetition of key metaphors that could be pruned for sharpness. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, maintaining readability despite high figurative load. A bit more restraint would heighten, not lessen, the impact of the strongest lines.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“a sunrise trapped in timber” is a strong example). However, the density of figurative language is high and fairly uniform, occasionally tipping toward purple and redundancy (“fractually precise” appears twice; “the hush… was a fragile curtain” echoes earlier stillness). This uniform lushness slightly dulls momentum and can blur rather than sharpen certain beats, especially under the ticking-clock premise. A bit more ruthless pruning and variation in texture would improve propulsion without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence-level craft is generally high: images are clear, syntax is controlled, and many lines do double-duty for atmosphere and action. There is some redundancy and mild purple edging—several metaphors cluster (“living constellations,” “amber breath,” “silver threads…like vines”) and certain concepts are restated (patterns noted, secret patterns, shifting patterns) without new pressure. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact and the closure image is not muddled. Tighter pruning of repeated ideas and one or two over-rich phrases would lift it to a more elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Imagery is often striking (“ink trembling like sea-foam,” “filament of light that curled like a whisper around his wrist”), and metaphors are mostly coherent within the established world. There is some risk of purple prose and adjective stacking, but it rarely tips into genuine muddle or confusion. Momentum is more contemplative than urgent, yet the prose sustains that mode without bogging down.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, flowing, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language (“brambled hope,” “trembling like a heart beat in the mist”) is mostly apt and not overstacked; there’s little outright purple prose or redundancy. A few abstractions (“a sense of calm,” “amplify hope”) dilute intensity slightly, and key beats could lean more on concrete embodiment. Still, momentum and clarity are never seriously harmed, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, often doing multiple jobs per line (advancing action, world-building, and theme simultaneously). Metaphors are generally coherent and sensorial, and the piece avoids true purple incoherence or mixed vehicles, keeping the action legible even in its most lyrical moments. However, figurative language is present in nearly every sentence, creating a near-uniform high pitch that occasionally blurs emphasis and could be tightened for maximal impact at key beats. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or mechanical artifacts, but judicious pruning would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, image-dense, and purposeful, with most lines doing multiple jobs of worldbuilding, mood, and theme. Extended metaphors are coherent and not over-mixed, and repetition (e.g., “graceless beauty,” “wound”) reads as motif rather than accidental loop. There is some summarizing of important efforts and a mild tendency toward ornate phrasing that slightly cushions urgency, but it does not obscure sense or closure. Line-by-line, the piece is publishable-grade; a small amount of pruning and strategic specificity around key beats would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally graceful, information-dense, and rhythmically varied, with images (foam, lattice, bridge, chrysalis) doing double duty as scene and symbol. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; metaphors stay within a coherent field of polymers, music, and water. There is some repetition of thematic phrasing and a touch of sentimentality in the final third, but no major loops or muddled images that impede momentum or clarity. Line-level craft is clearly above-average and publication-ready with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level is mostly clean and rhythmically aware, with high information density in individual sentences. However, there is a tendency toward figurative saturation—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor—which can blur impact and create a mild sense of purple prose. Some phrases and constructions (“mindfully scattered,” “glimmering parole”) recur more as decorative tags than escalants, and a few conceptually similar images (moonlight shards, droplets, silver ink) start to feel redundant. For a prestige venue, a leaner, more varied texture and a few sharper, less self-explanatory beats would be expected.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a high density of meaningful images that usually pull double duty for mood and concept. Metaphors are generally coherent and evocative (“bitter as burnt cumin… underscored with a bright citrus”) and the action remains intelligible despite the lyricism. At times the figurative load is heavy—multiple metaphors stacked in close proximity—and a few abstractions (“brittle resilience,” “sweet promise of memory”) blunt immediacy. Nonetheless, momentum is maintained and no major loops or scaffolding artifacts drag the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and imagistic, with strong rhythmic control and relatively few outright redundancies; images like “a soft sunrise captured in amber” and “murmurs of gratitude that rose like incense” are effective. However, figurative density is high and often stacked, occasionally veering toward purple and conceptual repetition (bridges/silos/voices are reiterated in similar language). Some sentences carry overlapping jobs gracefully, but others feel like ornamental restatements rather than new information. The closure image reads clearly, but a leaner line-edit could sharpen impact and reduce decorative echo.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and a good sense of rhythm (“moonlight spilling over her tools like liquid quartz,” “each fragment a filament connecting past explorers to present curiosity”). Information density is high, and most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character). However, figurative language is nearly constant, a few phrases recur (“quaked with reverie,” repeated statements of her motivation), and the accumulation edges into purple, slightly dulling impact. Trimming some redundancies and varying texture around the climax would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and image-rich, with many sentences doing dual work (worldbuilding plus emotion). At times, figurative density (“vapor that glittered like shattered glass,” “stone columns floated like leviathan bones,” “latent blaze,” etc.) accumulates to the edge of purple, softening impact through over-saturation. There are mild redundancies around key motifs and adjectives, though they don’t obscure causality or the closing image. A small amount of pruning and sharpening would bring this to a very high line-level.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are rhythmic, imagery is often striking, and most lines do double duty for mood and concept. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and a high density of metaphor that occasionally borders on purple (“quills glistening like tiny bells that never rang,” “crystal‑clear echo,” “living archive of cracks turned into chords”) without always adding new pressure. Some paraphrastic moves restate the same idea about empathy or silence in different words, slightly dulling momentum. Despite this, clarity and narrative propulsion are maintained through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning. However, figurative density is high and often redundant, stacking similar metaphors (pawns, sacrifices, yearning) in quick succession without fresh development. Several lines paraphrase nearby ideas (hopeful melancholy, beauty in difficulty) rather than advancing them, softening momentum. It’s strong, publishable-level lyricism, but a demanding editor would trim and sharpen before accepting.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, often doing multiple jobs per sentence (image, mood, and theme at once), and it reads clean at the level of grammar and clarity. That said, figurative density is high to the point of occasional purple prose, and some metaphors feel redundant or over-wrought, slightly dulling momentum. Repetition such as “intuition intuitively descriptive” and frequent stage-actor analogies introduce a faint sense of stylistic loop. Despite this, the closing images land clearly, and line-level clutter does not materially obscure the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose offers lush images and some strong lines (“leaves unfurling like pages of a forgotten manuscript”), and mechanics are clean. At the same time, figurative and adjectival density is high, with numerous similar constructions and repeated motif phrases that begin to blur rather than sharpen impact. Several sentences feel overwritten or slightly awkward (“olfactorily sensitive nose,” “journalize each day”), betraying the scaffolding of the prompt. Momentum is acceptable for a lyric piece, but tightening repetition and trimming purple edges would significantly elevate line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally smooth and clear, with strong images and minimal scaffolding or repetition artifacts. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure sense. Information density is decent—most lines advance worldbuilding or action—but some phrases reiterate the same awe or silence without adding pressure. The prose is solidly publishable but lacks the sharp compression and surprise of elite work.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is smooth and imagistic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and information (“anemometer, its red needle trembling like a nervous heart”). At times, figurative language stacks toward purple (“thread in a tapestry of future movement,” “hazy precision”) and repeats conceptual ground without adding new pressure. Still, clarity is maintained; action order and stakes are understandable and there are few outright redundancies. The overall line-level craft is above average but not razor-tight for an elite literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically attentive, and rich in imagery, and it passes clarity tests even in dense passages. That said, metaphor and elevated language are nearly constant, edging into purple and occasional redundancy (“through the colors of the aurora” and “sculpted hush” recur without always adding new pressure). Sentences often pile modifiers and abstractions (“oscillating repose,” “certify wonder as essential”) where tighter, more concrete phrasing could sharpen impact. The line-level craft is strong enough for literary venues but would likely need pruning for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, varied, and image-dense, with few outright redundancies or mechanical artifacts. Figurative language is mostly apt and coherent, and key objects (flute, driftwood, seam) are handled with economy as well as lyricism. There is some drift toward purple/repetitive phrasing around hush/silence and explicit thematic restatements, which slightly dulls momentum and surprise. Still, the prose remains clear and propulsive enough that these slips don’t significantly obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. There is, however, a tendency toward stacked metaphors and near-synonymous formulations (“thin veil of night thinned like parchment,” “cracked mirror reflecting multiple selves,” “galaxy of murmured feelings”) that risk redundancy and mild purple prose. Momentum occasionally softens under this density, especially since pressure is already low. Still, clarity is rarely compromised, and the final images land cleanly despite some ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatical, clear, and rhythmically varied, and many images (“symbols bloom like night flowers,” “aurora’s colors pooled like liquid glass”) are striking. There is some purple-prose drift and repetition of similar constructions (glow, humming, germinate, wonder) that could be trimmed for higher density and sharper impact. The prose remains legible and propulsive enough, but often does one job (evoking beauty) rather than layering pressure or specificity. Tightening metaphors and cutting redundancies would move this closer to elite calibre.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are precise (“glass prism that glimmered like a captured sunrise,” “luminous veins that traced the prism’s colors”) and most sentences do multiple jobs of mood, world, and motion. Rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is preserved despite lyric density. Some metaphoric layering (“truth wrapped in paradox, each syllable a truthful lie”) verges on purple, but remains legible and thematically aligned rather than muddled. Overall, the prose would require only light tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong images like “threads that whispered of stories yet unspun” and the filament rising through the canopy. However, metaphor density is very high, and some repetitions (“stoically sparkling,” “hush of time’s tapestry”) verge on purple and slightly slow momentum. Despite the lushness, clarity of action and closure remains intact, but some pruning would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and very few outright redundancies. Figurative language is generally coherent and in-register, and the piece maintains momentum despite its lush descriptiveness. That said, the density of metaphor and repeated constructions (various "hums," "glitters," and "pulses") occasionally verges on purple, slightly blurring edge and urgency. Trimming a few echoing phrases would tighten impact; as is, it reads as strong but not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished, with varied syntax and rich but mostly controlled figurative language. Sentences often do double duty—worldbuilding and emotional color together—and the rhythm suits a contemplative, speculative piece. There is a mild tendency toward density and repeated abstract formulations (“weight of a withheld truth,” “endless lattice of possibilities”) that could be trimmed for even sharper momentum. Still, clarity remains intact and no major artifacts or loops undercut the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery and relatively high information density—many sentences carry both atmosphere and character. Some phrases and concepts recur a bit too often (“safety bottled,” “anonymous letters,” glowing stones), edging into mild redundancy and a touch of purple prose. Syntax and grammar are clean, and action is easy to follow; nothing essential is obscured by language. Tighter cutting of near-duplicate sentiments would sharpen momentum and keep the lyricism from feeling over-insistent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with rich, imagistic sentences that carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic echo) and a clear causal throughline. There is some tendency toward dense, near-continuous figurative language (“living serpent of light,” “chorus of silver syllables,” “shadowed elation”) that flirts with purple prose but stops short of obscuring meaning. Redundant intensifiers are rare, and grammar/usage are clean, but a few images feel piled rather than escalatory, slightly dulling momentum in the middle. The closing lines land with clarity and musicality despite the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and dense with image, and momentum is maintained despite the lyric mode. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, and some phrases or concepts recur in near-identical form, edging into mild purple prose and redundancy. Clarity and closure remain intact, but a more selective, contrast-driven use of imagery would heighten impact. There are no glaring grammatical issues or confusing constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich, often doing multiple jobs per sentence—establishing mood, world, and interiority together. There is occasional purple tilt and repetition (sorrow quantified/measured, miracles named as such) that could be trimmed for greater sharpness and momentum. Still, clarity is rarely compromised, and the line-level musicality supports the accumulative, meditative feel. The final images land clearly despite some ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, which occasionally tips into purple and reduces contrast—very few plain, grounding lines to set off the images. Some phrases and concepts recur without adding pressure (“woven dawns,” “knit communities together,” “bound release”), creating light paraphrase loops. At a top-tier venue, this would likely need tightening for concision and sharper emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear, fluid, and image-rich; many sentences do double duty in atmosphere and interiority, and grammar/usage are clean. Some metaphors are effective (“shelves curved like riverbanks,” “ink smeared like a secret sigh”) and support tone. There is, however, a tendency toward repetition and purple phrasing—“nested paradoxes,” “hidden in plain sight,” and “enlarged tranquility” recur enough to feel slightly overworked rather than deepened. Still, line-level craft maintains momentum and never obscures causality or the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the read-aloud rhythm mostly holds. There is some tendency toward purple density and repetition of key terms and structures that could be pared for greater sharpness and momentum. Figurative language remains coherent, but the lack of contrast—everything is equally burnished—flattens emphasis. With line edits for compression and variation, it could approach elite level, but as-is it carries noticeable ornamentation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and mostly precise, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “turning invisible vibrations into a soft, trembling glow”). Some repetition and near-synonym loops (“quartz hush,” “luminous vows,” “edge of oblivion” motifs) verge on decorative rather than always advancing pressure, giving a faint purple cast. Still, line-level clarity is very high, and the closure image is sharp and legible rather than muddled. Trimming a few redundant metaphors would tighten momentum and lift it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mostly clean, vivid, and well-rhythmed, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some mild purple drift and repetition (motifs and formulations recur with little variation), and occasional summary sentences (“Her motivation was…”) that tell what nearby images already show. Line-level clarity and momentum remain strong; cause and effect are never obscured. Tighter pruning of redundant modifiers and overt thematic scaffolding would lift this into a more exceptional register.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and musical, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). However, figurative density is high throughout—stacked metaphors like scents as code, soil as memory, and ballots as vapor—creating a mild sense of purple overload that slightly blurs sharpness and momentum. There are a few near-repetitions of concepts (emergent compass, terrestrially cosmic, convergence) that could be tightened without loss. Still, syntax is varied, clarity holds, and both opening and closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and information-dense, often doing double duty with atmosphere and action. However, figurative language is very frequent, and repeated constructions like “auroral sorrow” and “painted the air with melancholy light” verge on purple, occasionally blurring rather than sharpening sense. There’s some conceptual redundancy (multiple variations of the same emotional state and calling) that could be tightened without loss. Despite these excesses, clarity remains intact and momentum is adequate for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that are mostly precise and reinforcing rather than muddled. The prose balances worldbuilding and movement without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops, and key images (zinc plate pulsing, bottles vibrating, vent breathing clean air) are sharp. There is a mild tendency toward purple, especially in stacking metaphors, but it does not obscure clarity or closure. The final paragraphs remain clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, with strong image-making in lines like “turning silence into a visual chorus” and “the subtle shiver of stone.” However, there is noticeable repetition and paraphrase—especially around “glisten,” “muted,” “wonder,” and “symphonies of truth”—that could be tightened for concision. Some sentences stack modifiers or abstract nouns in ways that slightly blunt impact rather than sharpen it. Momentum holds for a lyric piece, but trimming redundancies would give the same imagery more force.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and often do double duty for image and mood. Some phrases and concepts (“chaos,” “miniaturized,” “static”) repeat in ways that start to feel slightly incantatory rather than accumulative, and a few lines verge on purple abstraction. Nonetheless, causality and imagery remain legible, and there are no major loops or scaffold sentences that stall momentum. The final paragraphs could benefit from a touch more precision and a touch less thematic restatement, but the prose is nearly ready for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose has several strong images and good sensory layering, but it leans toward repetition and abstraction (“each item a whispered story,” “a sound only the heart can hear”). Some phrases feel mechanically reused rather than freshly reimagined, which dulls momentum. Syntax and grammar are clean, and most sentences do more than one job, but the density of soft metaphors verges on purple without adding new pressure. Line-level control is competent and readable, yet not as sharp or economical as elite venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density and relatively few wasted sentences; most images work and interlock. However, figurative language is very dense and occasionally redundant (repeated tides, breathing, webs, and song metaphors) in a way that slightly blurs sharpness. Some phrases (“the act of liberate”) read as awkward or overly abstract, and a few sentences rephrase similar ideas about encoded vulnerability and calm defiance. The prose is strong and lyrical but could be tightened and varied for peak-effect at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush but largely disciplined: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and motion) without obvious padding. Imagery clusters coherently around light, salt, gravity, and sound, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright purple muddle. There is some repetition of concepts and similar sentence cadences, but not enough to stall momentum at this length. Line-level clarity remains high all the way through the closure, and there are no visible copy or syntax errors.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure; it reads smoothly aloud and maintains momentum for the length. Some lines verge on purple or redundant (“smoothed hush,” “tranquil blaze,” multiple quiet/peace formulations), adding ornament more than new information. Still, figurative language is mostly coherent and pattern-driven rather than muddled, and syntax remains clear. Trimming a few near-duplicate phrases would sharpen the spell without harming its texture.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, rhythmically varied, and densely informative without major redundancy. The imagery (meteors as hymns, walls with heartbeats, the seal as pact) is cohesive rather than scattershot, and there are few if any mixed metaphors. Some phrasing leans purple and explanatory, slightly dulling momentum, but it doesn’t obscure sense or closure. Overall, the prose is publishable with only minor tightening for concision.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose showcases strong poetic instincts—phrases like “each bloom trembling under the sigh of dusk” are striking and memorable. Yet figurative language is nearly constant, and key terms (“tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve,” “resonance structures,” “quarantined memory”) recur in ways that feel like loops rather than purposeful patterning. This density sometimes blurs rather than sharpens sense, and multiple sentences restate similar concepts about memory and isolation with slight variation. Mechanics are clean, but line-level economy and variation would need tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is often beautiful and sensorially dense, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and world-building; the aurora, marble, and water imagery largely succeed. That said, there is an accumulation of near-duplicate phrases and abstract modifiers (“calibrated treason,” “wisely enduring calm,” “crystal-clear vow”) that create a sense of mild purple prose and reduce momentum. The key’s melt/return inconsistency also functions as a line-level problem that tangibly harms clarity at closure. Tightening repetition, pruning some abstractions, and resolving that object-state error would notably sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences flow smoothly, imagery is lush, and there are few if any syntactic or grammatical slips. Many lines do double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and the rhythm suits a meditative, mythic piece. That said, figurative density is very high—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated phrase—which edges toward purple and occasionally dilutes impact through sameness (frequent “humming,” “whispering,” “melancholy”). A touch more spareness or variation would give key images more punch.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. At times it verges on purple, stacking metaphors and abstractions (“loom of memory,” “dream-tide,” “borrowed starlight”) in quick succession, which can slightly blunt impact and momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, there are few redundancies, and the closing images land cleanly. Tightening a handful of figurative clusters would bring it closer to elite line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-dense, with strong sensory specificity, but it edges into purple and repetitive in places (“scintillatingly somber,” reiterating the same motifs without adding new nuance). Several sentences effectively restate prior ideas—the parapet “listening,” nets catching dew, and hidden patterns are articulated multiple times with similar metaphors, which softens momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent, yet the accumulation of similes and personifications can feel over-layered for a 600–800 word piece. Overall readability and clarity remain solid, but a demanding editor would want pruning for concision and sharper turns.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable, with mostly clear syntax, few redundancies, and functional rhythm; the descriptive passages are often effective. There is some repetition of key phrases (“comfortable lies,” “stillpoint”) and a tendency toward explanatory sentences that tell the thematic stakes outright. Figurative language is used sparingly and mostly coherently, avoiding egregious purple prose but also rarely surprising. The prose supports the story without obvious artifacts, but it doesn’t consistently carry multiple layers of work or deliver truly striking lines.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, grammatically clean, and rich in concrete imagery, with many sentences doing dual work for mood and world-building. However, figurative density is high and somewhat repetitive, with key phrases and constructions reappearing so often that they begin to feel like scaffolding rather than fresh turns. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about prophecy, variant allegiance, or forging dawn from shadows, which slightly dulls momentum. Despite this, clarity at closure holds and the rhythmic control is above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally smooth and often beautiful, with several striking images (“coaxing dust motes to dance like tiny planets in a far‑away sky”). Yet figurative density is very high—nearly every sentence reaches for a metaphor or heightened description—which softens impact and occasionally feels purple. Certain words and ideas recur with little added value (“amber,” “sweeten,” “redemption,” “hymn”), creating mild redundancy. Line-level craft is solid but would benefit from sharper concision and more variation in texture to avoid saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong sensory density and many lines doing multiple jobs (character, mood, and world at once). However, figurative language is frequent and occasionally tips into excess or self-consciousness (“fleshly ethereal glow,” “sun’s golden limbs”), which can slightly blunt clarity and momentum rather than heighten them. There are no major scaffolding loops or syntactic templates, and the action sequence (especially around the resonance test and vault opening) reads cleanly. Overall the line-level craft is strong but not ruthlessly pared, leaving some ornamental weight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are clear, images concrete, and momentum—though intentionally slow—does not stall. There is some purple-prose drift and conceptual redundancy (e.g., repeating “restrained wildness,” “softly purposeful,” restating the patience thesis in varied forms) that could be pared back. Figurative language remains coherent, and mixed metaphors are avoided, but density is high enough that individual images occasionally blur. The final beats are lucid and well-phrased, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically serviceable, with some effective images (droplets turning to “tiny stars” under the lantern). Yet it tends toward density and repetition in metaphor and abstraction—many sentences pile evocative language that restates similar concepts (memories, reverberations, control) without adding new information. This veers into mild purple prose and slows momentum in a short piece that needs sharper line-level economy. Tightening and pruning redundant figurative beats would significantly increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and mostly clear, with a good balance between action and description and few outright redundancies. Some metaphoric turns (“his coat bore the weight of iron bars and whispered confessions,” “each tooth a memory of a life once lived”) are effective, but others verge on purple or become repetitive, especially with the storm-light motif re-used verbatim. Despite the lyric density, cause and effect remain legible and momentum is not badly stalled. A slightly stricter line edit could trim ornamental phrasing and heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and imaginative, packed with concrete, inventive phrases (“wheels humming like sarcastic philosophers”). Information density is high and most lines do more than one job. However, figurative language is almost unrelenting, which slightly blurs emphasis and propulsion; the piece skirts purple without quite tipping over, limiting top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, concentrated, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for plot and atmosphere. Some metaphors and repeated phrases (“echo of forgotten songs,” “hum of forgotten data”) verge on the familiar or slightly purple but don’t cloud meaning. There’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn; information flows forward with decent momentum despite the reflective mode. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, though a pass to trim repetitions and sharpen a few images would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is often beautiful and imagistic, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and the rhythm is generally smooth. Yet there is density drift into near-purple abstraction—clusters of high-concept phrases (“courageous anomaly,” “map empathy onto action,” “weight of unspoken hopes”) that repeat emotional content rather than sharpening it. This accumulation slightly blurs momentum and dilutes the impact of key beats because very little language is pared back at peak moments. Line-level craft is strong but not yet ruthlessly selective enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally graceful, with strong sensory detail and a good rhythm between longer, flowing sentences and shorter emphatic ones. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme; images like “choir of surrender” and “pages turning in a book that had long been closed” work well. That said, metaphor density is high and occasionally repetitive (“fold in patience,” “sound of endings,” “wind’s promise of release” recur) and a few lines slide into purple or explanatory (“travel as a euthanasia tourist was not about seeking death”). Tightening redundancy and trusting imagery over summary would elevate line-level craft into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose showcases some striking images (“amber light seem like liquid memory”) and a strong sensual palette, but it is frequently overwritten, with stacked modifiers and repeated conceptual phrases that blunt impact. Lines like “His motive was simple yet profound: to nurture intersubjective understanding…” feel didactic and heavy, slowing momentum. Multiple near-duplicate constructions (“by drawing parallels,” “gently persuasive,” “passionate subtlety”) create a paraphrase-loop effect and a monotonous cadence. Clarity is mostly preserved, yet the density of figurative language sometimes muddies rather than sharpens emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with pleasing cadence and a good ratio of image to abstraction; sentences often carry multiple functions (world-building plus theme). There are some repeated abstractions (“echo of wisdom,” “peripheral awareness”) and mildly purple constructions, but they do not significantly obscure sense or momentum. Little obvious scaffolding or synonym-looping appears, and syntax varies enough to avoid a mechanical feel. A slightly leaner line and more concrete embodiment under peak moments would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically varied, and rich in imagery, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, the density of figurative language (mist as whispers, photos as shards of light, healing as tide, etc.) creates a slight purple-tinged uniformity; some metaphors repeat the same emotional note instead of advancing it. There's little true scaffolding or confusion, but strategic tightening and pruning of redundant ornament would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, theme) and read smoothly aloud. There are some redundancies and over-dense constructions (“fractured sequences that fractured time,” repeated “suspended hush,” “reticent scholar”), and modifier stacking nudges toward purple. Nonetheless, cause/effect remains clear, and no major scaffolding or template cadences stall momentum. Tightening repetition and trimming a few abstract phrases would lift this into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “a thin line of white rose, outlining a faint hum…”). However, figurative language is nearly constant and leans toward repetition—“tide of longing,” echoes, sighs, sea imagery recur enough to feel a bit overworked. Some sentences could be tightened without losing meaning, and a few images are close variants of earlier ones. Clarity holds throughout, but refinement would be needed for elite-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: images are clear, syntax mostly unintrusive, and sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and motion together). There is some repetition of key phrases and emotional frames (“luminous ache,” “changelessly constant,” reiterated escape-velocity metaphors) that edges toward purple but stops short of real muddle. Figurative language is dense but internally coherent, and momentum is preserved because each image tends to advance the situation or deepen the mood. A modest tightening—trimming a few near-duplicate sentiments—would elevate clarity and impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatical and flows, but it frequently tips into purple, with stacked metaphors and repeated signature phrases (“radiant haven above the clouds,” “scent of hope,” “pulsing stillness”) that begin to feel formulaic. Many sentences restate similar emotional content in slightly varied language, which softens momentum and sharpness. Imagery is often pretty but not always precise, sometimes blurring rather than clarifying the emotional beat. Line-level work is competent but not yet lean or surprising enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is smooth, grammatical, and generally efficient, with some attractive images (“time to ripple around the isle like a thin veil of glass”). There are mild tendencies toward abstraction and repetition around “loops,” “sealed awakenings,” and stated purposes, but they rarely muddle meaning or stall momentum. Line-level work is solid and readable, though not so compressed or surprising as to feel immediately publish-ready for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong—rhythmically varied, metaphorically rich, and largely free of syntactic or clarity errors; most sentences do double duty in atmosphere and character. However, the figurative palette leans toward repetition: constellations, stars, lattices, galaxies, and maps recur so densely that they verge on purple and slightly blunt individual images. Phrases like “shrewdly innocent” repeat without new shading, and some lines paraphrase earlier ideas about mistakes and constellations. Still, momentum is mostly preserved, and the final images land clearly despite a bit of over-ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose has many striking lines and images, and individual sentences generally read cleanly. Yet it veers toward purple: figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence, and certain phrases loop (e.g., “reflectively vibrant,” “zephyr bloom,” variations on mist and light) without adding new pressure or information. This repetition and saturation reduce momentum and make key beats feel texturally similar. Despite that, cause-and-image clarity at the ending remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning, and the read-aloud rhythm is mostly smooth. However, there is noticeable repetition of signature phrases (“honeyed hush,” “proffering small stones,” “protected vulnerability”) and a tendency toward density of metaphor that can feel slightly over-decorated. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar emotional content rather than adding pressure or new nuance. These issues do not derail clarity but slightly dull the sharpness expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lines are grammatically clean and mostly clear, with a smooth read-aloud rhythm and strong recurring images. That said, figurative language is dense and somewhat repetitive (mist as veil, hush, applause; current as narrative flow), edging toward purple and occasionally diluting force. Some phrases loop conceptually without adding pressure (“she solemnize each encounter… she solemnize the act of binding hopes”), and a verb form error (“She solemnize”) jars at this level of ambition. Overall, the craft is solid but not razor-honed for maximal precision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with fluid rhythm, clean syntax, and images that often do double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., pollen as “sealed vow”). There is some tendency toward purple or stacked modifiers and conceptual repetition (songs, stories, vows restated in slightly different language), which marginally slows momentum. Still, clarity is never in doubt, and key beats (vine unfurling, golden threads, pollen cascade) are sharply rendered. Line-level craft is publishable with only light tightening for redundancy and over-lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich imagery and competent rhythm; most sentences carry both atmosphere and thematic work. Figurative language is frequent but more controlled than purple, and metaphors are largely coherent and on-theme (light as veins, constellations, lighthouses). There is some repetition and mild over-insistence (“moving stillness,” reiterated inhaling/exhaling world/orchard) that could be trimmed without loss. Line-level momentum holds, and closure is clear and undulled by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with good syntactic variety and few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and on-theme (echoes as tides, light as whispers, photons as memories), avoiding outright muddle. There is some repetition of key phrases (“wounded season,” “cellar of reason,” “reflective”) and an almost unbroken lushness that risks slight overwriting and momentary drag in the middle. Nonetheless, causality and imagery remain legible, and the final lines land with a clean, charged image rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is lush and mostly controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Repetition of signature phrases (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie,” “bronze grotto”) builds pattern rather than pure redundancy, and the syntax is grammatical and legible. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, so some images blur together and feel decorative rather than necessary, slightly dulling momentum. A bit more spareness around key turns would sharpen impact and prevent the prose from edging into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for image and emotion (e.g., sap as “translucent memory vault,” rain beads as “tiny metronomes”). However, figurative language is nearly wall-to-wall, creating moments of purple overload and diminishing the impact of the strongest images. Some phrases repeat conceptually (“rust-hued peace,” “crystallized time,” “vessel that could contain love”) without adding new pressure, and the prose occasionally explains what the images already imply. The overall effect is polished but slightly over-decorated, blunting momentum and sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong and rhythmic, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and emotional shading. However, figurative language is nearly constant, creating a mild purple-prose effect and occasional redundancy (e.g., reiterations of “eroded ambitions,” “fractured stillness,” regret as shards, beads, etc.). Some abstractions (“language her ghost understood,” “rhythm of forgotten wheels”) could be grounded more in sensory or concrete action to maintain momentum. Despite this, clarity holds and the final images are not obscured by the stylistic richness.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often lyrical, with some strong images (the terminal inhaling “a newly scripted breath,” windows bursting open to saluting stars). Yet there is noticeable repetition and conceptual redundancy—“maze of intentions,” “redirected flows,” and “hope” are reiterated with similar phrasing. Figurative density occasionally drifts into abstraction and mild purple-prose, reducing immediacy. Tightening and pruning would sharpen both impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-dense, with many sentences doing good double duty for mood and character. Yet there are clear artifacts: an entire sentence about recalling the night is repeated verbatim, several phrases recur without new charge, and metaphor stacks veer toward purple in places. “Excruciatingly gentle” and similar formulations are overused, reducing impact and adding a faintly mechanical feel. Line-level rhythm remains readable, but tightening repetition and trimming a few strained images would markedly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and fluent, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and few outright clumsy constructions. There is some purple inclination—stacked abstractions and repeated metaphors about lies, time, and clarity—that slightly blunt impact through over-insistence. A few near-duplicates in concept (“serene upheaval,” “calm storm of purpose,” “thoughtfully clear”) feel like mild paraphrase loops rather than fresh turns. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and key images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. A few moments skirt purple or repetitive territory (multiple fog/hush/patience images that overlap in function), but they don’t significantly muddle sense or dull the ending. Syntax remains clear and grammatical throughout, and the final images (coiled rope, stored fulgurite, harbor’s breath) provide an effective cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and frequently beautiful (“damp amber,” “bruised violet” sky), with strong sensory density and some effective metaphors. It occasionally edges into purple or redundancy—conceptually similar lines about mapping, explaining absences, and lonesome splendor recur without always adding new pressure. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and there are few outright muddled images, so the line-level craft is solid but not yet razor-honed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally fluent and imagistic, with strong sensory density and some lines doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding and emotional mirroring). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, edging into purple; metaphors stack (“quaking reverie,” “feathered light,” “banner of newfound hope”) without always adding new precision, and key phrases repeat. Some sentences could be tightened without loss, as similar ideas are restated in slightly different words. Despite this ornamental excess, clarity and momentum remain intact, but the line-level craft falls short of the austerity and precision expected at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, mostly clear, and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. That said, figurative density is very high (multiple metaphors per sentence in places), and certain motifs and phrases (“scars can sing,” “kelp-drift peace,” clouds as carriers of song) are repeated with minimal new pressure, edging into overstatement. There’s mild redundancy in summarizing Mira’s arc (reiterating that her fire now “rebuilds rather than razes”) instead of trusting prior images. The overall momentum survives, but a judicious trim would sharpen impact for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and it reads smoothly aloud. Yet figurative language is densely packed—nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction—which occasionally blurs impact and risks redundancy (“defiant hush,” repeated light imagery, layered metaphors like “kaleidoscopic prayers”). A touch of overwriting and one or two syntactic slips reduce sharpness at key beats. Line-level craft is strong but needs tightening for elite-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level craft is lush and mostly controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“petals that drifted like paper lanterns,” “filament of understanding that wrapped around the falling petals”). There is some density of figurative language and repeated phrasing (“approximates infinity,” “troubling serenity,” “quiet sigh”) that edges toward overrichness but doesn’t quite tip into muddle. Sentences are grammatically clean and causally clear; the piece maintains momentum despite its meditative pace. A bit more pruning or variation in image types would elevate this to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often beautiful, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and there are few true redundancies or scaffolding sentences. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent (light as verses, grief as river/tapestry, butterflies as poems), though the density flirts with overwrought in places. Rhythm varies reasonably, keeping momentum despite a reflective frame. A slight pruning of metaphor stacks would sharpen impact without changing content.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is polished, with mostly clean syntax, vivid imagery, and high information density—many sentences do double duty for world, mood, and theme. Yet the prose leans into purple territory: stacked modifiers, repeated constructions (“searing reverie,” “incremental absolution,” “ethically diligent”) and frequent similar metaphors (“like ink,” “like shards of glass”) create a sense of ornamental excess. Some paraphrase-like reiterations of the same idea (small acts mending the world) slow momentum. Despite this, clarity remains intact and the final image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are grammatically clean, images often striking, and most lines do more than one job (atmosphere plus theme plus action). There is a tendency toward stacked metaphors and rich modifiers (“cobalt silo,” “velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”) that verge on purple but rarely undermine clarity. Some abstractions (“shape of intentions,” “pressure of centuries”) could be grounded more concretely, yet momentum does not significantly stall. It reads as polished literary prose with mild overwriting rather than tight, surgical control.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-rich (“air shimmered with a chill that sang of hidden possibilities,” “plates glowed, converting light into a steady current”), with good information density. There is some tendency toward purple abstraction (“seed innovation within a constraint,” “laboratory of possibility”) and repeated conceptual phrasing, which slightly blurs immediacy. Momentum holds despite summary because sentences usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, theme, and action at once). Line-level craft is strong but not razor-honed enough, nor spare enough, for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically attentive, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and world-building. However, the density of figurative language (dust, mist, glow, thistles, embers) verges on purple at times and occasionally repeats concepts without adding pressure. Despite this, clarity is never seriously compromised, and the final image reads cleanly. Trimming a few metaphors and redundancies would sharpen momentum for elite-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often striking and dense, with many sentences pulling double duty for atmosphere and theme, and several images (mask as snow, lattice as constellations) are memorable. Yet the line-level occasionally tips into purple or redundancy, stacking metaphors (“mirage of safety,” “powdered whispers,” “frozen breaths of lost time”) without adding new pressure. Minor grammatical slips and repeated constructions slightly compromise polish at a standard demanded by elite venues. Tightening and pruning would heighten impact and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush, image-rich, and generally precise, with strong rhythm and a good sense of when to linger. The recurring motifs (sediment, cog, water, valves) do multi-duty for setting, theme, and mood, contributing to high information density. That said, figurative language and conceptual restatements are dense enough to flirt with purple; some late sentences echo earlier insights in slightly different words, flattening momentum. Still, clarity holds, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose often achieves striking images (the rosette “glimmered like a captured sunrise,” notes pulling leaves into a dance) and generally maintains clarity. Yet metaphor density is high across nearly all lines, with some phrases sliding toward purple or conceptual vagueness (“threading golden threads through a tapestry of silence,” “subtracting noise from the thick autumn air”). A few near-repetitions and abstract formulations slow momentum and slightly blunt the impact of peak beats. Tightening figurative language and pruning redundancies would bring it closer to elite-line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with dense but generally coherent imagery (“rust into fleeting ruby veins,” “seed’s surface rippling like a thought about to break”) and minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent, and it rarely slips into mixed or confusing metaphors. Sentences do multiple jobs—world-building, mood, and action—without much scaffolding or filler. The only limitation at the very top band is that the relentless lushness slightly mutes dynamism and sharp edges; a touch more variation in texture could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with high information density and few outright redundancies; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or theme. However, metaphoric stacking (honey/nectar/amber/fireworks) verges on purple, especially in the final third, softening impact through saturation. A bit of paraphrase and intensifier redundancy creeps in (“a loss of wonder that once turned routine maintenance into a spectacle” plus later restatements). Rhythm and clarity remain good, but tighter pruning of repeated imagery would sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally high: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, concept), syntax is varied, and there are few if any mechanical errors. However, metaphor density is often very high (“hushed blaze,” “tiny moon,” “streetlights daydream”), with some images echoing others rather than adding new facets, which reads as mildly overwrought for an elite market. There are small patches of conceptual repetition around hush, sanctification, and listening that could be tightened without loss. Despite this, clarity and momentum hold; no major artifacts obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is lush and often striking, but figurative language is nearly constant, creating a density that sometimes blurs rather than sharpens. Several phrases or concepts recur with only slight variation (“cascading revelations,” “threading” memories, certainty/nuance metaphors), which introduces a sense of looped diction. Sentence rhythm tends toward long, similarly constructed lines, reducing propulsion. Line-level craft is competent and mostly clear, but would benefit from pruning and more varied texture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and grammatical, with some striking images (“chip that caught the dim light like a wounded star”) and efficient compression of years of work. That said, the prose tends toward conceptual repetition and slightly purple abstractions (“boundless confinement,” “balancedly daring,” “a perpetual promise whispered through stone”), with several adjacent sentences restating similar ideas about motion and confinement. Figurative density is moderate but occasionally feels self-conscious rather than transparent, and concrete detail is sometimes sacrificed for rhetorical flourish. The writing is solid and publishable, but would benefit from small cuts and sharper sensory anchors to avoid drift into sameness.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sentences are musical, generally clear, and densely informative, often doing double duty for mood and theme. There is noticeable repetition of certain constructions and descriptors (“saffron quiet,” “methodically hopeful,” moonlight metaphors), but it mostly reads as motif rather than padding. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; it rarely collapses into mixed or incoherent metaphor. The main limitation is a slight air of over-richness that flattens dynamic range rather than any outright artifact or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is rich and generally precise, often doing multiple jobs at once (e.g., “trade stories like brittle coins” fuses world, mood, and theme). There is a high density of figurative language, but metaphors usually align and remain legible; purple tendencies are present yet not overwhelming. Some phrases and ideas repeat with minor variation (rosewater dread, thawing stone, honeyed sorrow), slightly softening momentum and edge. Overall, line-level craft is strong and polished, just shy of the tautness and economy top markets demand.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally fluent, with strong sensory images and a nice balance of syntactic lengths. There is some repetition and mild purple tendency—“latent radiance” and “bleak exhilaration” recur, and certain metaphors (e.g., radiance “spilling…like a dying star”) stack rather than sharpen. Nonetheless, clarity is rarely compromised, and most sentences pull double duty for mood and information. With some tightening of repeated phrases and clichés, this would be quite competitive.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft shows strong sensory density and some striking images (shadows unspooling like smoke, ink painting cursed roses), and sentences generally pull weight for atmosphere and motion. However, frequent repetition of constructed phrases (“lingering luminance,” “photographically cursed,” “repulsive allure”) and stacked modifiers create a slightly overwrought, incantatory feel that occasionally muddies crispness. The prose remains mostly clear despite the lushness, and causality is not obscured. Tightening a few metaphor chains and pruning repeated formulations would elevate it to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmic, imagery is vivid, and most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and motion at once). There is some redundancy and mild over-ornamentation (“lingering hum that lingered”) but not enough to seriously drag momentum or clarity. Figurative language is largely coherent and pattern-consistent, supporting the musical/sea motifs rather than competing with them.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, information density is high, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and theme. The figurative texture (“sunwashed dread,” “warning feather,” “molten ribbon”) is rich but largely coherent and doesn’t tangle sense. There are no conspicuous loops, scaffolding, or clarity failures; transitions between beats are smooth. Some metaphoric density could be pruned to sharpen moments of highest pressure, but it doesn’t materially dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and largely fluent, with some striking images (ivy as veins, silver ink like moonlit water) and good sensory density. Yet it leans into purple repetition and stock constructions (“weight of centuries,” “pit of lies,” “new clarity”), and metaphors are often explicit theme-delivery vehicles rather than surprising perceptions. There’s some conceptual redundancy around noble lies and truth being rescued that could be cut for sharpness. Rhythm and clarity hold, but the line-level texture feels more earnest than rigorously pared.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, syntactically varied, and free of mechanical errors, with many lines doing double duty for setting and theme. However, figurative language is very dense, and motifs like “hush,” “blaze,” “quiet fire,” and “interlaced absence” recur so often they sometimes feel ornamental rather than freshly illuminating. A few sentences paraphrase similar ideas about memory and absence, slightly dulling momentum. Despite this, clarity and forward motion are not seriously compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with good sensory layering (scent of parchment, water altering ink, light on stone). There is some repetition of key phrases (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve”) and a tendency toward slightly purple constructions that risk flattening impact through uniform lushness. Sentences mostly do multi-duty (world, mood, character) and maintain clarity and forward motion. Line-level craft is strong but could benefit from more variation in texture and a few strategic cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is imaginative and often beautiful, with high information density and clean grammar, but it does verge on overwriting: metaphor stacks (“luminous torment,” “lantern… thin as a sigh,” “refractions that sang to the wind”) recur without always adding new pressure. Some concepts and phrases are reiterated in slightly different language, creating mild synonym loops and diluting impact. Rhythm is generally strong but fairly uniform, which can slow momentum in a piece of this length. A bit more selective restraint would sharpen the already striking images.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often striking (“bruise violet sky,” “air feel heavier than stone”) and maintains good clarity despite its density; each sentence typically earns its place. Yet there’s frequent metaphor stacking and conceptual redundancy (e.g., multiple formulations of potential, awakening, and resonance) that edges into purple and could be trimmed for greater punch. Phrases like “unfiltered awakening” and “bleak exhilaration flood his veins” feel slightly generic relative to the richer, more concrete lines around them. Line-level craft is strong but not yet as ruthlessly precise as top-tier venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is mostly clean, with strong visual imagery and a consistent rhythm, and it maintains clarity through the action. That said, there is noticeable repetition (“brilliant dimness,” “star trails,” restatements of belonging) and some purple phrasing that layers modifiers without adding new information. These tendencies slightly dampen momentum and lessen the impact of key lines that should feel sharper. It’s polished, but could benefit from strategic cutting and sharper variation to reach elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished at the sentence level with mostly clean syntax and some strong images, but it leans into purple excess and repetition. Metaphors cluster densely, and key phrases (“sieved hush,” “weight of a withheld truth,” “quell my conscience”) recur in ways that start to feel like scaffolding rather than escalation. Momentum sometimes stalls under the descriptive load, especially mid-story. Trimming a layer of figurative language and consolidating repeated concepts would markedly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and often do double duty for mood and information. There is some redundancy and mild purple edging—repeated storm/mist descriptors and motif phrases, plus a few neatly packaged maxims—that slightly dull momentum. Figurative language stays mostly coherent, and action sequencing is easy to follow. The final third remains legible and carries its images cleanly, even if occasional over-articulation softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is fluent and largely clear, with strong rhythm and a consistent metaphorical field around navigation, light, and water. Yet the density of figurative language and repeated structures (“backlash of regrets,” “flickering faith,” multiple sunrise paintings) crosses into mild overwriting, where several sentences restate similar emotional content. Some images feel generic or stacked (“water shimmered like liquid glass,” “pen across paper, drafting a narrative of redemption”), reducing impact rather than sharpening it. Line-level craft is solid but would benefit from pruning and a move toward fresher, more specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, with good sentence variety and some striking images; line-level clarity is high. There is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts (“labyrinth of choices,” “clean slate,” redemption framing) and occasional purple touches, but they don’t seriously obscure sense. Most sentences do at least two jobs—moving action while reinforcing theme or setting—and there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn. Tightening a few over-explicit lines and trimming redundant thematic statements would sharpen momentum and compression.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mostly clear, grammatically sound, and richly imagistic, with many lines doing dual duty for mood and worldbuilding. There is, however, a tendency toward purple density and synonymic overlap (repeated “silvered,” “luminous,” “ever steady,” “filament”) that slightly muddies impact and slows momentum. A few sentences restate similar ideas (her steady movement, the moon’s permanence, cosmic embrace) without adding pressure. Trimming and sharpening would elevate rhythm and keep the lushness from feeling occasionally over-sweet.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level writing is lush and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for image and mood, and no major clarity errors or scaffold. However, figurative density is very high—metaphors often stack (“choking beauty…wrapped the soul in velvet”) and abstractions recur, edging into purple prose in places. Some phrases are redundant or near-duplicative (“willingly perplexed” appears twice without fresh shading), and not every flourish earns its weight. The piece remains readable and evocative, but a more ruthless pruning would sharpen impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with few true redundancies. The figurative language approaches the edge of purple in places (multiple “ghostly,” “void,” “sea,” “light” metaphors) but maintains coherence and doesn’t tangle logic. There’s minor repetition of ideas (Nara’s lightness, ship drifting, sorrow-to-hope) without becoming full paraphrase loops. Overall momentum holds, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often beautiful at the line level, with some memorable images (fireflies as “captive constellations,” sparks as “miniature comets”). Yet figurative density is high and repetitive—“whispering hush” and “vibrant hush” recur, and many sentences stack similar mystical modifiers, creating a mild purple haze. Momentum suffers as multiple lines paraphrase the same ideas about coincidence, purpose, and transformation without adding new pressure. Tightening repetition and trusting images over abstract labels would significantly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically pleasing, and rich in metaphor, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. That said, figurative density is very high—light, glow, hush, and blooming imagery recur enough to flirt with purple, and some phrases (“winking hush,” “quiet intrigue”) feel like slight synonym loops. Line-level clarity remains intact, and there are no obvious grammatical or structural missteps. Trimming a few redundant modifiers and repeated motifs would sharpen momentum and lift this toward elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) per line. Figurative language (“salt and ancient fire,” dust “vibrating with the memory of a supernova”) is mostly apt, but the density of abstractions (“promise,” “patterns,” “sacred,” “cosmos’s hidden rhythm”) can verge on repetitive and slightly dilute impact. There are mild paraphrase loops around “promise,” “borrowed dawn,” and the curse rephrased as prison/compass, though they don’t obscure causality or closure. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with minor tightening for redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density and relatively few wasted sentences. Imagery tends to be stacked and metaphor-heavy, but the comparisons usually cohere (storms as ink, scars as maps) and create a unified aesthetic. There is some redundancy and near-looping—recurrent phrases like “cartography of scars,” “vigil in pause,” and “storm-kissed” risk feeling like motif by assertion rather than development. Overall, it’s strong literary-level craft with a mild tilt toward purple in places.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax and few outright redundancies that impede comprehension. Imagery around music, geometry, and water is often evocative, and sentences pull multiple duties (worldbuilding plus theme). Yet figurative density occasionally tips toward repetition—“hidden overture,” “dignified chaos,” and “turn questions into destinations” recur without always adding new nuance. This creates a mild sense of sloganizing and softens momentum, keeping the piece from feeling razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lush and image-dense—“thin line of light,” “whispered applause,” “luminous fracture”—and generally manages to stay legible rather than drowning in ornament. Sentences tend to carry multiple duties (setting, tone, theme) and there are few outright redundancies or scaffolding lines. However, figurative language is stacked heavily across almost every sentence, which slightly blurs distinctions between key beats and background texture. A touch more variation and spareness around pivotal moments would sharpen momentum and make climactic images hit harder.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“twelve and a half past forever,” “doorway of silver film”) and good syntactic variety. However, figurative language is almost continuous, which edges into purple and risks blunting individual images. There are minor repetitions (“with a steely longing” twice) and a sense of saturation that slightly dulls momentum. Clarity remains good throughout; the main limitation is density, not confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong rhythm, varied sentence structures, and generally high information density; many sentences advance both worldbuilding and theme. Metaphors are often striking (“lanterns that hummed…like questions in a bright hall of doubt”), and there are few if any outright muddled images or redundancies. Nonetheless, figurative language is very frequent, and in places it feels layered on rather than strictly necessary, nudging the piece toward mild purple prose. A touch more spareness in key beats would sharpen impact to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. That said, figurative density is high and motifs (lace, tide, cerulean, regret, “diffusing” sorrow) are reiterated in near-synonymous ways that could be tightened. A few lines verge on purple or explanatory (“He understood that the color of unspoken apologies was not a pigment but a feeling”), slightly dulling the closing image. Clarity remains intact, but some pruning would increase momentum and impact.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is weighed down by filter verbs ("She realized," "She sought") and abstract nouns that distance the action. Phrasing often falls into familiar patterns or clichés ("stood like a wounded beast," "garden ghosts") that lack freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("drifting resonance" ×4, "scorched testament" ×2, "steadily adaptive" ×2) creates significant artifact drag. The line "mind steady and steadily adaptive" acts as a redundancy loop that halts momentum and highlights the artificiality of the prompt integration.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is polished but hindered by metaphor density and abstract nouns acting as agents ("noise becomes impossible"). Clichéd phrasing ("heart that had found its rhythm") and "purple" descriptions occasionally obscure the clarity of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetitive scaffolding creates a robotic rhythm; specific phrases ("impossible spaces," "permanent address," "chased stillness") are repeated 2–3 times each within a short space. Similes are frequently over-written ("cracked like the memory of a storm"), leading to density without clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose density is low due to simile overload ("like a silent spine," "like a secret heartbeat," "like smoke," "like fireflies") and abstract phrasing. A glaring repetition artifact in the first paragraph ("amplified quiet that seemed to amplify") undermines line-level authority immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on mixed metaphors and abstract "poetic" filler ("grief could taste like iron," "stars sang") that obscure clarity. The high density of adjectives and sentimental phrasing stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("tide of time," "fabric of time," "rain-kissed earth," "heartbeat of the universe") and mixed metaphors that trigger significant overwriting penalties. The density of similes ("like a living sine wave," "like a Möbius strip," "like secret prayers") disrupts momentum, and filter verbs ("Mara felt," "Mara understood," "She believed") dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("glimmer of hope," "skeletal witnesses," "laughter long forgotten") and strained metaphors ("forgotten throat"). Adjectival stacking reduces information density and momentum, and the "staggering grace" phrase is repeated as a crutch rather than an atmospheric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and high adjective density, with frequent "X of Y" constructions ("note of betrayal," "whisper of growth") that obscure clarity. The reliance on abstract metaphors prevents the text from achieving narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is severely overwritten, suffering from a high density of similes ("like distant heartbeats," "like liquid dusk," "like suspended fireflies") that creates a figurative muddle. This constant ornamentation slows the reading speed and obscures the causal logic of the scene. The "purple prose" draws attention to itself rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is marred by oxymoronic clunkiness ("weighty lightness" used three times) and contradictory descriptions ("humming consoles lay silent"). There is significant word repetition ("glass," "thawing," "heart") and a reliance on adjective-heavy abstraction that reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is marred by purple descriptions ("hummed with an ancient sigh") and absurdities ("constellations... spelled my name backwards"). The required phrases ("firmly adaptive," "trembling certainty") are shoehorned in repetitively, creating jarring prose artifacts that disrupt the rhythm and expose the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition makes the text unpublishable; "ambered hush" appears four times and "marbled hush" three times in a short space, creating a distracting loop. The prose is dense with filter verbs ("sensed," "believed") and abstract mixed metaphors ("stitching the night's endless fabric") that obscure concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by repetitive phrasing (the word "amalgamate" is over-relied upon) and slightly purple descriptions ("whispered," "courtyard's breath"). The density is low, with several sentences restating the robot's purpose or feelings without advancing the scene's momentum or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and significant repetition of prompt phrases ("ambiguously clear" appears four times; "resonant hush" three times). These repetitions act as text artifacts that break immersion and serve as padding rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is overwritten and heavy with modifiers ("wisely pragmatic," "mildly," "soft mossy voice," "commemorating small victories elaborately"). There is a high density of abstract metaphors ("vines curling like whispered promises") that obscure the physical action. The repetition of "blooming withering" becomes a distracting artifact rather than a rhythmic device.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive loops and forced oxymorons ("icy warmth" appears three times; "mechanically warm" twice; "subdued awakenings" twice). These repeated text artifacts and the heavy reliance on adjective-noun pairings stifle momentum and create a drone-like rhythm that obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant repetitive word choice harms the opening immediately: "trembling lanterns... trembling like breath" in the first sentence, followed by a "trembling finger" shortly after. Words like "glowed," "echo," and "sigh" also repeat within short spans, creating a churning effect. These unforced errors in vocabulary control undermine the "flawless" standard required.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from the repetition of unique phrases ("auroral sorrow" x3, "swaying certainties" x2) which highlights the artifice of the prompt elements. Adjective density is high, and the text relies on metaphorical telling ("certainty is a brittle leaf") over concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with mixed metaphors ("air hung heavy with the echo... cracked the night") and suffers from severe keyword stuffing. The phrase "drowsy alertness" appears three times, "swallowed truth" three times, and "factory ghost shift" four times in a short space, creating a mechanical, repetitive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is weakened by cliché ("dissolve like ink in water," "fragile as glass") and significant repetition of the phrase "regenerative silence." The text relies on "scaffold" sentences that explain the metaphysical mechanics rather than grounding the experience in concrete, sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is marred by repetitive prompt-phrase insertions ("cautious exuberance," "softly adaptive") and clichés ("bloom with awe," "sun reclaimed its throne"). Pathetic fallacy ("roots... seemed to dream") weakens the line-level logic and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive artifacts drag down the score; "bronze quiet" appears four times as a modifier, and synonym churn around "hum/vibration/pulse" clutters the prose. The phrasing is often dense but relies on scaffolded descriptions ("purpose is simple yet profound") that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with mixed metaphors ("microscope of whispered light," "flag of revelation") that obscure clarity. High-density figurative language acts as a barrier to visualization, particularly in the mechanical descriptions of the cookie creation. Sentence structures are competent but stylistically cluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=2.8)
    Line-level craft is marred by a significant grammatical error ("intent on plumb the deepest echo") and awkward phrasing. Repetitive sentence structures and overwritten metaphors clutter the prose, reducing clarity and momentum. The text frequently tells rather than shows, summarizing complex actions in abstract terms.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density (e.g., "trembling like breath," "shards... baton," "membrane of vibrating chords"). The constant figurative language in the first half creates a "figurative muddle" that obscures the physical action, and the pacing drags under the weight of adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant repetitive artifacts harm the prose, with "periodically eternal" (x3) and "darkening brightness" (x3) appearing as clumsy loops. The reliance on oxymoron obscures clarity, and the density of abstract metaphor slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like a shroud," "like invisible ribbons," "like frost") and mixed metaphors ("splintered like a jagged filament of hush") that obscure clarity. Abstract concepts are treated as physical objects without sufficient grounding, resulting in "therapy-speak" artifacts ("frost of her inner apathy").

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetition artifacts severely damage the prose. The phrase "layered tranquility" appears four times, and "deepen/deepened" is repeated in close proximity. The reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she sensed," "she understood") distances the reader from the action. These loops suggest a lack of editorial polish.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant technical flaws, including the mid-paragraph tense shift and the repetitive/ungrammatical embedding of prompt phrases ("reveal, under ultraviolet revealing"). Prose is frequently overwritten ("mute witnesses," "trembling halo") and relies on abstract telling over concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is dense with "figurative muddle," employing a simile or metaphor in nearly every sentence ("verses like cracked shells," "flickered like lost memories," "walls glistened like amber"). This overwriting obscures the action and creates a sluggish, repetitive cadence that hampers narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor congestion ("memory of wind," "soft as a seed," "tide seeking a hidden shore"), which blurs clarity. Figurative language is stacked in nearly every paragraph, slowing momentum and drawing attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive artifacting lowers the score, with the phrase "half truth" appearing six times and "affectionate detachment" twice in a short space. The prose leans toward purple abstraction ("taste of old rain") that obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with purple descriptors and mixed metaphors ("frozen in sunrise," "cataloguing the sighs of ships," "carried like a secret tide"). Adjective/adverb density suffocates the action, and the reliance on cliché sentimental phrasing prevents any sharpness of image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.0)
    Prose is heavily overwritten with mixed metaphors ("ground itself whispered," "ache of light") and repetitive abstract phrasing ("luminescent ache"). The density of adjectives and "noun-of-noun" constructions creates a sluggish rhythm that obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense with abstract metaphors ("paint it with breath," "uncage moments") that frequently obscure physical action and causality. There is a heavy reliance on simile ("rang like," "loops like," "lingered like") and decorative adjective-noun pairings that slow narrative momentum and create a "purple" texture.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from high modifier density and mixed metaphors (math, gardening, and music conflated without distinct logic). The typo "stalactules" appears in the opening, and phrases like "dovetail the past with the present" read as forced prompt-fitting rather than organic syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe repetition artifacts significantly degrade the prose; "sapphire hush" appears five times and "kindly methodical" three times in a short text. Additionally, a punctuation error ("Marens") and reliance on filter verbs ("She realized," "She knew") lower the technical quality.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from significant artifacting, specifically the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("reluctant metamorphosis" appears four times; "releasing control" three times) which disrupts flow and feels mechanical. Figurative language is often strained or mixed ("veins... reorganized like tiny rivers reshaping a landscape"). The rhythm is sluggish, bogged down by adjectival density and lack of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by abstract phrasing ("raw grief," "inner fire") and the clumsy grammatical insertion of prompt terms. The pacing drags during the exposition of the legend, and the description of the convergence relies on visual clichés ("illuminated the night like a lantern") rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition, with the phrase "bright darkness" appearing six times and "unseen forces" five times in a short text. This semantic looping, combined with clichés like "symphony of light," creates a dense fog of abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is dense with simile and metaphor ("glistened like shattered glass," "lanterns flickered like fireflies"), occasionally drifting into purple overwriting. The insertion of prompt elements creates clunky, expository sentences (e.g., the explanation of "staggered intervals"). Line-level momentum is slowed by the reliance on static description over active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (e.g., "trembling certainty" used twice, "unspoken truths" four times) and adjective stuffing. Key moments are weakened by clunky telling ("sizzle as the phantom energy seeped"). The density of modifiers creates a sluggish rhythm that hinders the story's forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is overwritten with a high density of mixed or strained metaphors ("windows yawning," "tower seemed to inhale," "ribs of a whale's heart"). The reliance on adjectives and personification creates a purple texture that obstructs clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is dense with abstract genitive metaphors ("heart of misplaced destiny," "corridors of other realms") that obscure concrete imagery. Repetitive diction ("prismatic," "magnetic," "goodbye") creates a droning effect rather than a purposeful rhythm. "Lover's sigh" and "eyes heavy with... ennui" are worn phrases that reduce freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is dense with mixed metaphors and abstract nouns ("stone walls of prejudice," "ink's alchemy"). Phrases like "liquefy rigid thinking" are treated as literal mechanics, blurring the line between metaphor and reality in a way that obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is severely overwritten, with a density of metaphors that suffocates momentum ("trunks twisted like whispered verses," "corners frayed like the edges of stories"). Sentence structures are repetitive (Subject-Verb-Object + Metaphorical Phrase), creating a monotonous rhythm. "Incandescent restraint" is claimed but the style is florid and unrestrained.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts destroy momentum. Phrases are looped across adjacent sentences as scaffold ("collect fragments of overheard stories... By collecting fragments of overheard stories"; "reveal erased histories... Erased histories were"). These unpolished redundancies read like generation glitches and render the prose tedious.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("resonant hum," "painted seashell") and unintelligible imagery ("whisper of closing pages" as a physical location). A subject-verb agreement error ("conduits that reimagines") and heavy "purple" description disrupt flow.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is overwritten with abstract metaphors ("living verses," "relentless wonder") and relies heavily on telling over showing. The phrase "hopeful desperation" is repeated as a shorthand for emotion that the scene fails to dramatize concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is marred by repetitive phrasing (the phrase "dawning hush" appears three times) and dense adjective stacking. The ending relies on worn clichés ("heartbeat of the universe") and "tell-heavy" emotional summary rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is overwritten and sentimental ("tenderness," "quiet sigh," "coax life"). The central logic error (blind observation of light) is embedded in the sentence-level description, and "magnetic calm" is repeated as a crutch.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing and overwriting, notably the tautological "cracked spine cracking." Metaphors are often mixed or melodramatic ("shivering in the pale wind," "tiny gun"), and the reliance on adverbs ("subtly confident") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from redundancy and clunky phrasing, most notably the tautology "patient patience" and the awkward construction "wild hush of before the collapse dawn." High adjective density and "thesaurus churn" (e.g., "mute witnesses," "cadence of footsteps") slow the rhythm without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe keyword stuffing and repetition; "gathered hush" and "crystal perfume vial" appear five times each, creating a robotic cadence. Glaring grammatical errors ("scent immediately unsnarl," "seemed to touches memories") disrupt reading flow. Prose relies on tell-heavy abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=1.8)
    The text contains fatal flaws: a prompt leak ("your own story"), a verbatim copy-paste repetition of a long clause in adjacent sentences, and the quadruple repetition of "copperlight repose." These artifacts render the piece unpublishable without heavy revision.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant overwriting and purple prose obscure clarity ("tasted of molten hope," "sigh that tasted of roses and rust," "veil a whisper of ash"). The density of abstract metaphors and synesthesia creates a barrier to visualization and dulls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=2.8)
    The text suffers from high artifact density, with specific phrases ("broken precedents," "orchid solace," "storybook illustration plate") looped repeatedly within short proximity. The prose leans heavily on purple descriptors and metaphor ("humming like distant tide") at the expense of concrete action, creating a sluggish, decorative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is overwritten and heavy with adjectives and mixed metaphors ("roots that snaked between bones like pale rivers of memory"). The required phrases ("warmly curious," "purposeful wandering") are inserted clumsily as labels rather than organic descriptions. Repetitive sentence structures and "purple" descriptors stifle narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from high-density figurative language and mixed metaphors ("read by the ink of time," "lullaby of pixelated seas") that obscure clarity for the sake of sound. The reliance on abstract, poetic descriptions slows momentum and distances the reader from the concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacts; the phrases "echoed silence" and "adjacent possibilities" are looped three times each in short succession. Metaphors are often mixed or strain for effect ("echoed silence that pressed on ears"), and filter verbs ("She interpreted," "She imagined") distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition artifacts drag the score down; the phrase "fierce tenderness" is pasted in five times, and "gargoyle’s rainspout shard" appears three times in a short space. The required phrase "messages in condensation on windows" is inserted grammatically awkwardly, breaking the prose rhythm. This density of scaffolds obscures the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is dense with "purple" artifacts and mixed metaphors ("sky is a cracked mirror of bombs," "vine... on brain coral"). Adjective stuffing and abstract nouns ("cipher of shared anxieties") clog the line-level momentum, creating opacity rather than clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is laden with "purple" descriptors and mixed metaphors ("pulse of photon-kissed pigment," "smile had been unlatched," "trembling like chandeliers") that obscure clarity. Phrases like "pensive mirth" appear to be forced insertions that disrupt the rhythm. The text relies on adjectival stacking rather than strong verbs, resulting in a sluggish, ornamental pace.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of figurative language ("miniature auroras," "flicker like fireflies") that borders on purple. The exact phrase "methodically playful" is repeated verbatim, creating a distracting loop.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is purple and laden with abstract nouns ("converging chaos," "living cipher") that obscure the action. Adjective-heavy phrasing slows momentum, and the "candidly cryptic" insertion reads as a mechanical prompt artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, triggering the density and coherence penalties for figurative language. Metaphors clog nearly every sentence ("promises dissolving like sugar," "wind... like mischievous minnows," "starlight... like pollen"), often mixing imagery confusingly. The unrelenting "poetic" register creates a static rhythm that stifles narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is heavily laden with noun-adjective pairings and metaphors that feel decorative rather than functional, slowing momentum ("gently systematic shuffle," "soft chorus"). Specific phrases like "gently systematic" and "foxglove regret" are repeated verbatim without recontextualization, creating distracting text artifacts that signal a lack of lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is overwritten with dense, abstract metaphors ("ink that shimmered like sunrise," "truth that sang in layered chords") that obscure clarity. The phrase "smelled of dust and forgotten promises" is a sensory mixed metaphor, and the reliance on filter verbs dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.3)
    Prose execution is marred by repetitive sentence structures and forced insertion of specific phrases ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve") that do not fit the context naturally. "Dappled resolve" is a mixed metaphor that confuses the visual with the abstract, and "binary pulses" appearing from glue residue strains credibility even within a fantasy context. The text relies on filter verbs ("She felt," "She imagined") and telling rather than showing the emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is heavy with abstract telling ("She believed that preserving...") and cliché adjective-noun pairings ("luminous whirl"). Frequent use of filter verbs ("Lila knew," "She realized") distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple" overwriting, where abstract metaphors obscure physical reality ("distance becomes meaning"). Key phrases like "featherly determined" appear forced and grammatically awkward. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("fractured hush," "silent gaps") creates a repetitive, rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by significant repetitive diction artifacts; the words "soft" or "softly" appear seven times in a short text, creating a monotonous texture. The writing relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("luminous respite," "shadowseam wonder") and mixed metaphors ("breath held in amber") that obscure clarity for the sake of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and "purple" descriptors ("crater glass sang a violet sigh," "weep and smile," "mosaic of hopeful sorrow"). Figurative language is muddled and frequent, obscuring clarity in favor of ornamentation. Sentence structures are repetitive (Subject-Verb-Object sequencing for actions), and the reliance on adjective-noun pairings drags the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from high simile density and metaphorical clutter ("notes rose like gulls," "shards... resembled tiny constellations," "floated like fireflies"). This over-reliance on figurative language in every beat obscures the action and creates a melodramatic texture that lacks concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive phrasing ("obsidian grace" used twice, "obsidian tapestry" later; "fragment that held a fragment") disrupts flow. Metaphor density is high and occasionally mixed ("moonlight fell like spilled ink," "space fold like paper"), creating a "figurative muddle" rather than propulsion. The reuse of distinctive words like "fledge" creates an unintended echo effect.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition artifacts, with distinct phrases ("noctilucent," "read between lines," "clear complexity") repeated multiple times verbatim, creating a looping effect. Metaphors are often mixed or abstract ("ledger of deeds," "thin filaments"), and the density of adjectives slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is overwritten, with nearly every sentence stuffed with metaphors ("boots crunching... like distant applause," "light fell like rain, each droplet a syllable"). The phrase "hard softness" is repeated three times, creating a jarring lexical artifact. The density of figurative language obscures clarity and kills momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is dense with abstract noun pairings ("colors and numbers," "art and measurement") and relies heavily on adjectives, slowing momentum. A significant grammatical error ("knowing that revitalize the community's faith required") mars the inciting incident's logic. Phrasing often feels clunky to accommodate prompt elements, such as the awkward construction "creating patterns with decorations."

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose relies on adjective stacking ("ivy-veiled passage," "sensitively perceptive archivist") and "of" constructions, reducing immediate sensory impact.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose fails due to severe repetition of key phrases ("borrowed heartbeat" x5, "dusky harmony" x3, "coded lullabies" x3) which act as semantic loops. Adjective stuffing and mixed metaphors ("sky bruised," "stone air," "glass singers") obscure the action and destroy narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("clanged like a storm," "words fell like dew," "scent of jasmine") and abstract nouns that obscure the action. Repetitive phrasing ("ritual significance," "price of redemption") creates a looping effect that drags momentum. The metaphor density is high but lacks precision, creating a muddled image rather than a sharp one.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and mixed metaphors, such as the sky being "bruised with the lull" (visual impact from an auditory absence). Phrases like "amoral grace" and "fractured grace" repeat as scaffolding, and the density of adjectives slows the pacing without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is dense with "purple" artifacts and mixed metaphors (e.g., "scent of winter mingling with the metallic tang of unresolved poems"). Phrasing often falls into cliché ("colors no mortal eye could name," "forever changed"), and the reliance on abstract adjective-noun pairings obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("half-lit" appears five times, "reverse" five times, "hush" four times) which creates a mechanical rhythm. Sentence structures are repetitive ("She [verb]..."), and the adjective density stifles narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose relies on repetitive key phrases ("blushing stillness" and "interrupted cadence" each appear three times), creating a mechanical rhythm. Over-reliance on abstract adjective-noun pairings ("orange whispers," "rosy hush") obscures physical immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is overwritten ("slithered like a silver serpent") and suffers from the verbatim repetition of the distinctive phrase "snowmelt ardor." The phrasing "technically gentle" is semantically awkward and reads like a forced insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is weighted down by adjective density and "telling" summaries of complex processes. The repetition of specific phrases ("precisely playful," "wafer seal") creates a mechanical rhythm that feels like a checklist rather than organic storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition artifacts and "phrase stuffing," with "empirically ironic," "dusky harmony," and "uncloak" each appearing three or more times in unnatural contexts. The text is overwritten with abstract adjectives ("dust-laden," "vaulted," "silent") while lacking concrete verbs. Sentence structures are repetitive, creating a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from severe register drift, mixing high fantasy diction with clinical terms like "rewired," "cellular memory," and "nervous pathways." Metaphors are often mixed or physically impossible (e.g., a "clenched jaw" that "unfurled").

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with abstract mixed metaphors ("air trembled upon the shimmer," "welding unseen filaments") that obscure physical reality. Heavy adjective use and poetic clichés ("waning grin," "sing of distant stars") stall narrative momentum. The sentence structure is repetitive, often cycling through "He [verb]" patterns that create a plodding cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("accidental wisdom" x3, "deciduous vows" x3) and purple abstractions ("lesson settled like dew," "wisdom dripping"). These text artifacts clog the narrative flow. The "endearingly feisty" descriptor contradicts the gentle tone of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is competent but overwritten, relying heavily on abstract noun phrases ("nonlinear inheritance," "disquiet," "paradox") rather than concrete verbs. There are repetitive sentence structures and a tendency toward "purple" description that slows momentum; the phrase "simply complicated" is used clumsily as a refrain that feels forced rather than insightful.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe repetition artifacts damage the prose; the phrase "unheard symphony" appears six times in a short text, draining it of meaning. Overwrought similes ("like a surgeon exposing a hidden artery") and telling-not-showing ("carefully resourceful") clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with mixed metaphors ("lighthouse born of ink") and abstract noun phrases ("unkindled solace") that obscure meaning. Repetitive sentence structures and "telling" emotional states weaken momentum, while the relentless lyricism creates a monotonous rhythm that numbs the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies on abstract nouns and purple phrasing ("whispered of a paradox," "verses of an unfinished epic") that blurs concrete action. "Telling" artifacts, such as "Mara's motivation was singular," stall narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetition artifacts dominate the prose, with specific phrases ("gently luminous," "bloom of hush," "hammered repose," "crack patterns in ice") appearing three to four times each in a short space. These loops act as scaffolding that obscures the narrative flow and suggests a checklist approach rather than organic description. The sentence structure is also repetitive, often relying on "He [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on mixed metaphors (thistles do not "sing") and abstract emotional summaries rather than concrete sensory details. The reliance on "humming" and "vibrating" as primary descriptors renders the physical experience vague.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy artifacting is present; "deepening hush" and "preemptively nostalgic" are repeated three times each as verbatim tags, creating a template cadence. Abstract phrasing ("sculpt identity from experience") consistently replaces concrete action or sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("velvet blank," "silent witnesses") and filter verbs ("seemed to inhale," "seemed to smile," "seemed to pulse") that dilute immediacy. Abstract metaphors displace concrete action in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is burdened by clichés ("mirror of the cosmos") and mixed metaphors ("words fell heavy, trembling like stones"—stones do not tremble). The reliance on adjective-noun scaffolding ("warmly observant," "calm hand") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several prompt insertions damage the line-level flow. The phrase "stretching contracted" creates a syntactic stumble ("stretching contracted as if"), and "intangibly tangible" reads as a clunky oxymoron. These artifacts disrupt the otherwise polished rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose suffers from "purple" abstraction and mixed metaphors ("ship of glass over thought") that blur imagery. The forced insertion of prompt adjectives ("fluidly logical mixture") results in awkward collocations that damage the sentence rhythm and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=2.2)
    Prose is weighed down by telling ("commenced her search") and awkward phrasing ("peel of paint layers"). The misuse and misspelling of the required action verb ("sallyed" for "sallied") constitutes a significant craft failure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with metaphor congestion ("stitched darkness," "walls a whisper") that obscures clarity. Excessive lexical repetition of "breath," "inhale," and "starlight" (used 9+ times combined) creates a redundant, looping rhythm that drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional but overwritten with dense adjective-noun pairings and metaphors that clutter the action ("fibers of reality," "translucent violet curtain"). Rhythm is somewhat repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing and adjective stuffing; "golden shadows" appears four times, and "first yawn of evening" twice within a short space. The writing relies on "purple" descriptors ("bridge of intuition," "patient muse") that obscure meaning rather than sharpening it. These stylistic artifacts create a droning rhythm and prevent the imagery from landing with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from forced inclusion of prompt terms, resulting in grammar errors ("he unsnap the lock") and tense clashes ("as reality shifts" in a past-tense text). Overwritten metaphors ("stretched the night like a canvas awaiting a painter's breath") clog the pacing. "Factually mystical" is a semantic clash that damages the line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose suffers from high artifact density, including mixed metaphors ("pulse of hope humming through dust") and clichéd abstractions ("broken heart stitching itself back together"). The repetitive use of "unfurling" and "hope" creates a monotonous, overly sweet texture.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with mixed metaphors ("seed that would grow in the cracks," "threads the transmission had sewn," "liquid memory"). Phrases like "At the moment when plans unravel" act as scaffold insertions rather than narrative beats, and "promising another reappear" is a grammatical stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is heavily overwritten and repetitive, with specific phrases ("vested hush," "negative space," "dewdrops form") looped excessively. There is a jarring tense shift in the second paragraph ("As dewdrops form, the cold air trembles"), and metaphors are often mixed or nonsensical.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from heavy "purple" overwriting and adjective-noun stuffing ("slender fork," "ancient verses," "luminous liquid"). Abstract metaphors ("hush where past meets prophecy") obscure clarity and slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is weighed down by filter verbs ("she realized," "felt") and repetitive imagery ("swirling leaves," "phosphorescent"). The ending relies on pathetic fallacy ("leaves... as if applauding"), and the phrasing serves to explain concepts rather than embody action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.4)
    Metaphor density obstructs meaning (seam shining "like a sunrise caught in a river of steel"), and the "unlit fire" measurement is a significant logic error. The phrase "luminous regret" is repeated as a clumsy noun phrase rather than integrated into the emotional landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on "purple" metaphor stacks ("fragile thread of pain that shimmered like sunrise glass") that obscure clarity. Filter verbs ("knew," "sensed," "felt") and adjective clusters clutter the sentences, slowing momentum without adding informational density. Repetitive phrasing ("confessions... confession") and mixed metaphors ("mend the crack in its own echo") degrade line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=3.9)
    Repetitive phrasing ("bruised senses," "bruised memories") and a reliance on abstract nouns create a dense, opaque texture. The integration of required terms is mechanical ("proprioceptively enhanced"), and mixed metaphors ("lattice... that flickered") obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.5)
    A glaring typo opens the story ("The I have spent"), disrupting immersion immediately. The prose is overly dense with adjectives and abstract metaphors ("elusively tangible," "eternal instant") that clutter the sentence rhythm. The reliance on "I [verb]" sentence structures in the second half creates a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.6)
    Significant repetitive phrasing mars the prose; "skillfully observant," "weightless burden," and "cracks in the façade" are repeated verbatim as labels. The density of adjectives ("slender, rusted rod," "tiny, ornate clock") slows momentum and clutters the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive sentence structures (an "Each [noun]..." construction appears 8 times; "She [verb]ed" anchors most paragraphs). The density of similes ("like rain," "like wings," "like snow") clogs the rhythm, and filter verbs ("She realized," "She watched") dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=3.1)
    Prose is overwritten with heavy adjective stacking ("gilded relic," "luminous veil") and lacks rhythmic variety. The phrase "burnished sorrow" is repeated three times as a clumsy motif, creating a distracting text artifact that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors ("rust... behaved like a garden of iron vines"), and the phrase "tinkersong wonder" feels cloying. There is a reliance on telling over showing, particularly regarding the magic mechanics and Alder's emotional state, which flattens the immediate impact of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive use of key phrases ("resonant hush" appears three times) and modifier-heavy clichés ("battered satchel," "liquid glass," "fleeting ghost"). The density of abstract metaphors ("whirl of star-water") frequently obscures the physical causality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is cluttered with repetitive "text artifacts" and looped phrases (e.g., "turbine-hum reverie" x3, "timewoven alliances" x3, "storm-tossed archway" x3). These verbatim repetitions act as scaffold/padding rather than motifs. Additionally, clunky phrasing like "scaffold complexity with simplicity" appears twice, disrupting the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from high density of modifiers and clichés ("silver threads," "soft veil," "quiet fire"). Mandatory phrases ("quietly driven," "umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") are repeated to the point of becoming noticeable artifacts. The reliance on similes and abstract metaphors distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is marred by pervasive "telling" and a lack of concrete, moment-to-moment density. "Searing reverie" is repeated as a clunky scaffold, and the text relies on abstract nouns and adjectives instead of specific verbs and sensory details. The synopsis mode flattens the rhythm, creating a monotonous cadence devoid of scene-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from "purple" abstraction and sentimentality ("sigh that carried the weight of every wish"). Reliance on filter verbs ("imagined," "conceived," "remembered") distances the reader from the action, and metaphors often blur the image rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and adjective density ("velvet disquiet," "mournful brass," "ancient grief"). Clichéd phrasing ("weight settle like dew," "tapestry of sorrow and hope") and a reliance on abstract noun pairings drag the momentum and obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and mixed metaphors ("soft rain that fell as tiny gears"); the "furiously tranquil" oxymoron reads as a forced artifact. Information density is low due to adjectival padding ("quiet echo," "distant winds").

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally polished and readable, with clear imagery and decent rhythm. However, the insertion of "credibly curious" as a modifier is clumsy, and the narrative relies on summary and explanation (telling) during key moments rather than immediate scene work (showing).

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, saturated with abstract metaphors and "purple" descriptors ("celestial fire," "primal elegance," "echo the heartbeats"). Frequent use of filter verbs ("sensed," "feeling," "heard") and template cadence (adjective-noun pairings) creates a rhythmic monotony and obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from high-density overwriting and "purple" genitive constructions ("calm of a stone lake," "honey of memory"). Frequent mixed metaphors and abstract nouns stall momentum and obscure clarity, violating the standard of immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract metaphors ("minutes stretching like thin silk") and adjective-heavy scaffolding; the density of figurative language often obscures the literal action and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is marred by the severe, mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("woven dawns" appears five times; "warmly attentive" three times). Figurative language is often mixed or abstract ("clouds aligning like verses"), and the repetitive epithets create a jarring, artificial rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, with specific phrases ("brazen calm," "gently systematic") repeated verbatim three times each in a short space. The writing relies on purple abstractions ("countdown that pulsed," "tide's sigh") and filter verbs ("She noted," "reminded her") that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.8)
    The phrase "bronze quiet" is repeated five times in a short space, creating a severe repetitive loop that breaks immersion. The prose is dense with filter verbs ("watching as," "Arin realized," "Arin felt") that dilute immediacy. Mixed metaphors ("tiny prisms that sang of elemental bonds") often obscure meaning rather than illuminating it.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from "adjective-itis" ("bruised violet," "bleached bones," "wind-kissed ferns") and frequent scaffold phrases ("In that moment," "He felt"). The reliance on filter verbs and abstract summary in the final third creates a drag on momentum, reducing the text's immediacy and density.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is overwritten and purple, cluttered with opaque phrasing like "ears pruning the hush" and "letters trembling like fireflies." Adjective stacking ("smoldered amber," "wild hush") slows momentum, and "intuitively descriptive keenness" is a tell-y placeholder for actual description.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is marred by redundancy ("stretched like taffy... temporally stretched," "confusion melt... turn confusion into") and heavy filtering ("I sensed," "I recalled," "I saw"). The density of adjectives and metaphors obscures the action and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is overwritten and dense with modifier-heavy constructions ("glittering monolith," "midnight velvet," "sacredly playful"). The text relies on cliché similes ("soul expand like a sunrise") and forced insertion of prompt phrases ("cautious abandon" appears twice). These artifacts and the high volume of scaffolding adjectives stall narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.0)
    Significant repetition artifacts lower the quality, notably the phrase "benevolently ruthless" appearing twice to describe different things. The prose is overwritten with abstract metaphors ("nomadic penumbra" repeated four times) that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.8)
    Simile saturation ("like a silent cathedral," "like storm clouds," "light as a sigh," "like night flowers," "like lungs") creates a repetitive, dragging rhythm. The prose prioritizes ornamental density over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=3.2)
    A significant grammatical failure occurs when inserting the prompt element "fidgets productively" into a past-tense sentence ("He paced slowly, fidgets productively..."), breaking the narrative flow. Additionally, the repetition of distinct phrases like "woven hush" (four times) and "fierce repose" (three times) creates a distracting echo.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is burdened by excessive metaphor density ("like a wounded beast," "like water," "like shards," "like drums") and repetitive lexicon ("refract," "shards," "echo," and "bone" appear frequently). This overwriting obscures the action and creates a rhythmically monotonous texture.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is dense with similes ("like a skeletal ship," "like... questions," "like a clock-gear," "like frost"), creating a repetitive figurative rhythm. The insertion of an expository definition for kintsugi halts narrative momentum and breaks the fictive dream.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density that obscures meaning (e.g., "tunnels twisted like the brushstrokes of a tempest"). Phrasing is often cliché ("force of a tide," "glowed like lanterns") or abstractly decorative ("mixing oil with memory"), stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and a reliance on cliché similes ("like a tide," "like wind sculpts sand," "like moonlit water," "like a lover's arms"). "Filter verbs" (watched, felt, realized) distance the reader from the immediate experience, and abstract nouns ("vibrations of intent") replace concrete imagery. The writing is technically functional but stylistically bloated.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant repetition of full phrases ("patina bronze censer foot" appears four times; "raw solace" twice) creates a stilted, scaffolded rhythm. Metaphors often mix or confuse the physical reality (eyes made of maps vs. visual observation), and abstract labels replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive purple prose and incoherent similes ("surged like a sapling in a windstorm," "certainty of a mushroom's spore") obscure clarity. The density of figurative language distracts from the action and slows pacing significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prompt attribute "softly persistent" is repeated four times in a short text, constituting a severe artifact loop. The prose suffers from high-density metaphorical clutter ("ribbons of gold," "filling the empty page with invisible ink") that obscures physical action and reads as purple rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on "purple" metaphors ("lingered like a memory of distant seas") and simile-heavy descriptions that slow momentum. Rhythmic patterns are repetitive, and the density of abstract imagery obscures the physical action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=1.5)
    Severe text artifacts degrade the prose. The specific phrase "a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" is repeated verbatim, the second time resulting in a grammatical wreck ("breathed a shared exhale spotting..."). Repetitive tagging ("softly commanding") and metaphor overuse ("bleeding starlight" appears four times) destroy immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract "concept salad" and suffers from the repetitive, clumsy insertion of required terms like "revalue" (used three times). The phrasing often feels mechanical, designed to check boxes rather than flow naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and metaphors that clutter the sentences ("weatherworn," "pine scented," "indifferent"). Forced inclusion of prompt phrases ("jaded with wonder") disrupts the rhythm and reads as artificial insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and mixed metaphors (e.g., "water... glimmering like a quiet tear shedding light"). There is a reliance on "adjective-noun" pairings ("reverent fingers," "muted hum," "faint ticking") that creates a lulling, repetitive rhythm. The writing prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over clarity and concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose execution is marred by significant artifacts, including the jarring double adverb "smiled softly brightly" at the closure. Tautological phrasing ("held that breath during a held breath") and repetitive word echoes ("saturate... saturated hush") indicate a struggle to integrate prompt phrases naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from excessive simile density ("like a holy relic," "like a held breath," "like loose pages," "like sentinels"), which violates the density check for high-pressure beats. Repetitive phrasing of prompt terms ("induced currents" appears six times) creates a distracting mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily repetitive, using the phrase "resounding hush" four times and "spiral arbitration" three times, which reads as prompt-forcing rather than motif. Figurative language is often mixed or clunky ("stone arches breathing a quiet rhythm," "heartbeat of forgotten epochs"). The density of abstract nouns obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the imagery is lush, the prose suffers from heavy use of filter verbs ("he realized," "he knew," "he understood") that distance the reader from the immediate experience, especially at the climax. The reliance on adjective-heavy description ("delicate rhythm," "gentle sigh," "pure, steady light") slows momentum. The rhythm is somewhat repetitive, lacking the syntactic variety needed to build tension.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies and mixed metaphors ("quiet wildfire calm," "embers sparking under ash" in a mushroom farm). The writing is adjective-heavy and relies on abstract phrasing ("invisible circuits that seemed to map their own hidden connections") that obscures the literal action.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant "phrase looping" (e.g., "clover melancholy," "rainwashed library," "lucid contradictions" repeated verbatim) creates a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm. The prose relies heavily on telling ("She was theoretically rebellious") and abstract nouns, failing to ground the experience in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but overburdened with similes ("like a forgotten vein," "like a question," "like fireflies") and repetitive descriptors (using "ghostly" twice in close proximity). The density of figurative language occasionally obscures the concrete action, and the "explain-everything" summary at the end saps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is marred by significant repetition of prompt phrases ("haunted euphoria" x3, "regenerated covenant" x4, "proximate causes" x2) which creates a mechanical, looping rhythm. Mixed metaphors and abstract constructions ("steep the sighs of the sea") obscure clarity and reduce emotional impact. The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from simile overload ("like a mute witness," "like a secret handshake," "like a captive star," "like a green curtain," "like a rusted hinge"), which creates drag. Repetitive diction (variations of "polite" and "rumor") and "tell" summaries in place of active scenes weaken the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is competent but laden with clichés ("absorbs... like a sponge," "ink on parchment") and abstract nouns ("love, loss, and hope"). The reliance on filter verbs ("Lira felt," "she understood") distances the reader from the immediate experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("tangled ribbons," "orchard of data," "tide of spacetime") that sometimes obscure clarity in favor of poetic effect. There is a reliance on adjective-heavy description and abstract nouns ("paradoxical steadiness," "intentional threads") which slows momentum. The line-level craft prioritizes sounding profound over precision, leading to a "shimmering but vague" textual quality.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from heavy "purple" artifacts and mixed metaphors ("ripple a silver sigh," "mute grammar," "frozen memories"). Diagnostic label-speak appears in peak beats ("Joyful sorrow filled Arlen’s chest"), effectively halting momentum to explain the emotion. The density of adjectives distracts from the action, creating a sluggish rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=2.8)
    The phrase "volcanic tenderness" is repeated three times, creating a distracting artifact rather than a motif. Abstract descriptions ("equations of color") replace concrete imagery, and the pacing is rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is overwritten with strained synesthesia ("fragrance composed of vibrating blossoms") and a high density of metaphors that clutter the climax ("luminous bells," "auric lagoon," "auroral in hue"). This figurative overload obscures the action and reduces the emotional impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on adjective-noun pairings and standard similes ("faint as a moth's wing," "creases like age-worn veins"). There is little rhythmic variation to match the alleged storm intensity. The writing prioritizes ornamentation over propulsion, resulting in a dense, sluggish read that lacks immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from mixed metaphors (eyes described as a dental mirror) and repetitive phrasing ("spiralingly calm" appears three times; "shutters" seven times). Frequent use of filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "understood") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with mixed metaphors ("dust danced like quiet fireflies," "forests of second thoughts," "pawn into a potential queen"). There is a high frequency of "adjective-noun" pairings and abstract concepts treated as physical objects, creating a "purple" texture that obscures clarity. The writing prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and mixed metaphors ("tenderness that could soften steel," "muscles sang"). Key phrases are repeated to the point of distraction (e.g., "combative tenderness" appears three times). The density of figurative language obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from high abstraction density ("emotional void," "quiet redemption," "morally ambiguous purpose") that blunts immediacy. Frequent filter verbs ("Mara felt," "she imagined," "she understood") and heavy-handed metaphors ("shavings fell like snow") create a layer of separation between reader and action.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.2)
    Line-level execution fails due to extreme repetitive artifacts; the exact phrase "lantern-moth hush" appears four times, and "humming quartz colonnade" appears four times. The prose is suffocated by adjective-heavy abstraction ("watercolor of doubts," "ribbons of soft fire") that obscures clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with stock metaphors and abstract similes ("shards of sunrise," "fragile promises," "tongue ready to speak," "whispered its fire") that clutter the imagery. High density of filter verbs ("felt," "believing," "hoping") distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.5)
    While some imagery is competent ("footsteps echoing like struck glass"), the prose is severely damaged by the forced repetition of prompt phrases. "Golden shadows," "propel," and "powerfully gentle" appear frequently enough to form scaffold loops, disrupting narrative flow. These lexical artifacts expose the mechanics of the writing and prevent immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from abstraction and repetitive phrasing (the specific prompt terms appear multiple times). Frequent use of filter verbs ("decided," "realized," "understood") distances the reader from the action, and the density of metaphors often obscures concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("inherited mystery" x3, "steadily curious" x3, "rain-beaded skylight" x2) signals mechanical construction and clogs the prose. Adjective stacking ("rusted brass," "onyx-ink," "rain-streaked") slows momentum and reduces lexical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.8)
    The text relies on repetitive, verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("anguished joy," "steadily unpredictable," "atoms of nostalgia" appear multiple times). This mechanical repetition creates a scaffolded feel, preventing flow. Phrasing is often clunky ("method of avoiding patterns"), and abstract nouns clutter the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from purple descriptors and the awkward repetition of prompt phrases like "softly deliberate" and "luminous regret." Grammatical phrasing is strained (e.g., using the verb "metamorphose" as a noun concept: "metamorphose was not merely..."), and the density of adjective-noun pairs slows momentum significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that obscures clarity ("fragile convictions wobble like a candle," "tiny, trembling comet," "tugging like a taut string"). Frequent use of adjective-noun pairings creates a sluggish rhythm. The text relies on "felt" and "knew" filter verbs to convey information.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant "purple prose" issues and mixed metaphors ("vibrated like distant meteors," "grains of water") obscure clarity. The prose strives for poetic density but achieves opacity, prioritizing decoration over function.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from extreme simile overload, with nearly every sentence relying on a "like X" construction (e.g., "like slow snow," "like a cartographer," "like tiny birds"). This repetitive scaffolding stalls momentum and clutters the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is overburdened with "figurative muddle," relying on dense, often mixed metaphors ("constellations that pulsed like quiet hearts," "darkness scented with hope") that obscure clarity. This overuse of ornamental language creates a static, suffocating texture that stalls narrative momentum in favor of aesthetic display.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("echoing... like a metronome of sighs") and abstract clichés ("fabric of existence," "stitching destiny"). Key phrases are repeated to the point of distraction ("fractured lullaby"), and the forced insertion of prompt terms disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=2.1)
    Significant grammatical errors disrupt the text, specifically the forced conjugation of the prompt phrase ("could translocates," "can translocates"). The prose suffers from severe repetition loops: "hum of insight," "wind through different trees," and "probable miracles" each appear 3–4 times, creating a drumbeat of stock phrases that deadens the rhythm. Metaphor density hinders clarity, mixing "mental foliage" with mechanical imagery in confusing ways.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is weighed down by clunky repetition of prompt phrases (e.g., the full "ticket punch with star stamp" appears four times) and abstract purple prose ("curling like dreaming clouds"). Sentence rhythm is monotonous, often relying on [adjective]-[noun] pairings that degrade density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of specific phrases ("unpardonable silence" x3, "frostbitten hope" x3, "seraphically mundane" x2), triggering loop penalties. The density of adjectives and "purple" descriptors slows the reading momentum and obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from heavy adjective-noun pairing and melodramatic phrasing ("sunder the very floor," "hymn of graceful collapse"). There is a high density of filtering and summary ("radiating a presence," "whispered of forgotten dynasties") that obscures immediate sensory details. The reliance on clichés like "trembling fingers" and "dying ember" dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is marred by the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("periodically eternal," "drifting moored") which appear multiple times as awkward modifiers, breaking immersion. There is a tendency toward overwriting ("thoughts floated like kelp") and metaphorical confusion (tapping turning a table into a metronome for coral breathing). These artifacts significantly clutter the line-level experience.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts mar the prose; the specific phrase "thunderous serenity" is pasted in four times within a short text. Additionally, lexical loops on "broken" and "hum/humming" create a monotonous texture, and the high density of similes stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but suffers from a lack of scene-level propulsion, relying on "was/were" constructions and summary transitions that stall momentum. There is a tendency toward telling over showing ("Anara realized it might be the key"), and the final paragraph drifts into generalized overview rather than staying grounded in the specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and filter verbs ("she noted," "she realized") that distance the reader from the physical scene. The repetition of the phrase "anchor optimism in realism" and the clinical term "somatic markers" creates a repetitive, didactic rhythm that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.3)
    Prose is marred by repetitive phrasing (the specific phrase "luminescent ache" appears three times; "broken" appears seven times). There is a typo ("a oak table"), and the reliance on abstract mixed metaphors ("pressing the air into a thin, luminescent ache") obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.1)
    A major continuity error undermines the central mechanism: the ink cannot vanish "the moment it touched air" and simultaneously paint a persistent spiral etched in sand. Prose is frequently purple ("liquid mercury," "bleached bone") and relies on adjective density over active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.7)
    Prose is overwritten ("shiver traveling down a frozen spine," "voice a shard of ice") and suffers from awkward insertion of prompt phrases that disrupt rhythm. The use of "Thus" to introduce the moral conclusion highlights the lack of organic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts, with specific prompt phrases ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet") appearing 3–4 times in a short space. The style leans toward purple description ("breathed a sunrise of amber fire") that obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=3.1)
    Significant overwriting and "purple prose" hurt clarity, with mixed metaphors ("stitched with sleepwalking constellations") crowding the line. Repetitive phrasing artifacts (phrases like "transliterates emotions," "patterns break themselves," and "feral lullaby" appear multiple times verbatim) stall momentum and expose the scaffolding of the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and strained similes (a hum reminding one of a rustle). Repetitive phrasing diminishes impact; "orbits of regret" appears three times, and "solemn yet playful" (or variants) appears twice as a tell. The density of adjectives slows the pace without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density and cliché ("flickered like dying stars," "torn fabric of their past"). The "Thus..." and "In the end..." sentence structures signal a summary wrap-up that kills narrative momentum and relies on telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from awkward, prompt-forced phrasing ("She was socially perceptive, noticing...", "interject meaning") and repetitive abstract metaphors. The explicitly stated motivation creates a meta-textual artifact that breaks narrative immersion, and the "lilac unease" phrase becomes a repetitive tic.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of prompt phrases ("warm coldness," "aberrant mercy") and reliance on abstract adjective-noun pairings that stall momentum. The density of "text artifacts"—phrases inserted whole rather than woven into the logic—creates a robotic, fill-in-the-blanks rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies heavily on "telling" via clunky phrases like "synesthetically blessed" and "realized his purpose." High metaphor density ("draped," "hummed," "pulsed," "swirling") clogs the pacing without clarifying the action.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=2.9)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, looping specific prompt phrases ("fractally precise," "willowglass," "somatic markers") four times each in a short space. This repetition creates a mechanical scaffold that obscures the prose's natural flow and reads like a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" over-description and abstract metaphors that blur the imagery ("quiet that only the stones could hear"). The insertion of the phrase "factually mystical" is jarring and creates a clunky, tell-heavy rhythm that disrupts the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is overwritten with mixed metaphors and abstract nouns performing concrete actions ("echo gathered the grains like memory"). A significant tense error occurs with the mandatory phrase "As the truth unravels, she felt," clashing present aspect with past tense. The final sentence shifts entirely to present tense ("begins"), breaking the established retrospective frame.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from mixed metaphors ("light that rose like a phoenix... stitching together") and high-density repetition of the phrase "silver hush" (used four times). Mandatory phrases like "prudently daring" are inserted awkwardly as labels.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=2.9)
    Significant "purple prose" and metaphor density impede clarity (e.g., "fog curled like spindrift"). A glaring grammatical error—"practiced a method of through ambient awareness"—exposes a forced prompt insertion. Repetitive phrasing ("spindrift serenity," "closely attentive") further degrades quality.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is overwritten, featuring mixed metaphors ("sun rose... like a careful sigh") and category errors treated as literal mechanics ("phototropic to kindness"). Repetitive imagery and abstract descriptors obscure physical action, and the register drifts between mythic and pseudo-scientific.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("quivering hush" x3, "wistfully pragmatic" x2, "protected vulnerability" x2) creates a mechanical, looping rhythm. The prose relies on adjective-heavy description ("feeble glow," "gentle light") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("atomically reflective" and "brittle awakenings" both appear 5 times) degrades prose quality and reads like a checklist. The writing relies on telling ("Mira understood," "The method was simple") over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is dense with "purple" descriptors ("sequined ribbons," "mosaic of whispered confessions") that prioritize ornamentation over clarity. Abstract filter verbs ("sensed," "realized," "understood") rob key moments of immediacy. The repetition of phrases like "prismatic quiet" feels repetitive rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with mixed metaphors ("airwaves split like a mirror shattered"). Reliance on abstract adjectives ("celestial," "ethereal," "subsonic") creates a lack of immediacy and slows narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and melodramatic phrasing ("trembling the air," "yawning cavern"). There is a lack of sentence-level propulsion, with the text relying on abstract nouns and passive constructions. The heavy use of figurative language in low-pressure moments obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is marred by repetitive vocabulary and verbatim prompt insertions that break flow (e.g., "lance" used three times as a metaphor; "furrowed hush" repeated). A tense error arises from pasting the "evidence disappears" prompt into a past-tense narrative, and the density of clichés ("eyes that were not eyes," "thin line of blood") weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetitive phrasing ("nervous/nervously" x3, "spongey dread" x3) creates noticeable artifacts. The prose is dense with purple metaphors ("coat stitched from hope and dread") that obscure clarity and reduce impact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose quality; full phrases like "pixelated amnesty" (4x), "scaffold wrap flutters" (4x), and "luminous disbelief" (3x) appear with distracting frequency in a short text. The writing relies on dense, abstract metaphors ("emptiness... like a photograph developing") that often obscure rather than clarify the action. This keyword stuffing prevents flow and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe repetition artifacts undermine the prose; "polished calm" appears four times and "calm" seven times in a short text, creating a robotic cadence. The reliance on "When [event]..." sentence structures to bridge time gaps further weakens the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is heavily laden with "purple" artifacts and pathetic fallacies (e.g., "trembling desk," "paper curling like a sigh") that obscure the physical reality of the scene. Repetitive phrasing ("words/heal," "variable stars," "daylily-pressed") creates a droning cadence rather than rhythmic propulsion. Metaphors are often mixed or imprecise ("translate silence into symbols," "mending unseen fractures... as gently as sunrise"), prioritizing sound over sense.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on simile-dense scaffolding ("howled like," "collapsed like," "like a fisherman," "whirl like," "shimmering like") which clutters the rhythm. Phrasing is often forced to accommodate prompt words ("unbend a frozen confession").

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is dense with abstraction and "purple" phrasing ("shadows that sang," "whispered histories") that obscures meaning. There are multiple text artifacts, including the repetition of the prompt phrase "anxious elation" as a tell, and the awkward syntactic insertion of "after the future arrives early."

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("inlaying meaning everywhere" and "dusky resolve" both appear twice verbatim in ~450 words), creating a scaffolded, artificial rhythm. "Trammel" is used twice in close proximity, and abstract phrasing often displaces concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is densely purple and overwritten ("wrested meaning from the metal," "scaffolding that insulated my fear," "crash as a cymbal of possibility"). Frequent use of abstract emotional labels and mixed metaphors obscures the physical reality of the scene, failing the clarity and density tests.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is weighed down by adjective-noun pairings ("iron-kissed leaves," "metaphorical soil," "unspoken patterns") and abstract telling. The writing relies on poetic abstraction ("wind whisper ancient codes") over concrete, active verbs, resulting in a sluggish pace.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished and lyrical but relies heavily on filter verbs ("sensed," "saw," "realized") to convey internal states. While the rhythm is generally good, some descriptions lean toward the ornate ("coaxed the metal into a shape that breathed") without adding causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with abstract nouns and adjective-heavy scaffolding ("soft, trembling gleam," "latent radiance"), slowing momentum. There are multiple instances of mixed metaphors and "label-speak" that obscure the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is heavily marred by "prompt-ese" artifacts and severe repetition. Key phrases ("daringly methodical," "map references," "raw solace") are looped verbatim multiple times within a short space. The sentence "My coat was patched with old accordion bellows tape... I carried an accordion bellows patched with tape" is redundant and clumsy.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetition artifacts are present, with "cautious exuberance" (4x), "propagation delays" (3x), and "cyclically reversed" (3x) creating a checklist cadence. These loops clutter the prose and prevent immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetition of prompt words ("propagate" x4, "mulberry ache" x3) creates text artifacts that stall momentum. Metaphors are often mixed or decorative ("lattice of veins," "perforated destiny") rather than clarifying.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is overwritten, suffering from a high density of adjective-noun pairings ("radiant hush," "trembling aurora," "dwindling spark") that creates a sluggish rhythm. Figurative language is frequent and decorative, often cluttering the sentence structure without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is marred by repetitive "gentle/quiet/hush" descriptors and awkward, forced metaphors ("heart scalloping," "breath echoing the vineyard hush"). These artifacts suggest a struggle to incorporate prompt words rather than organic description, reducing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from frequent filtering ("She sensed," "She noted") and "telling" that explains the meaning of symbols as they appear. Metaphors are sometimes mixed or clunky ("unhook the knot of certainty... hoping to welcome nuance"). The density of abstract nouns (guilt, certainty, nuance, doubt) flattens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is decorative and repetitive; phrases like "sycamore hush" and "teach vanishing to appear" recur awkwardly within a short span, creating a loop effect. The style leans into abstraction ("weaved carefully," "cipher") at the expense of concrete, grounded immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from lexical repetition ("pulse," "echo," "canyon") and the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("weathered resolve" appears twice as a label). The reliance on adjective-heavy description ("skeletal spires," "ancient ribs," "thin air") slows momentum and creates a dense, somewhat purple texture.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetition artifacts mar the prose; "lingering luminance" appears four times, "accommodates impossibilities" three times, and "brilliant dimness" twice, creating a looping, robotic cadence. Filter verbs ("He sensed," "He realized") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from excessive overwriting, relying on mixed metaphors and relentless personification ("whispered," "sang," "groaned") that obscures clarity. Repetitive phrasing ("meteor hush," "luminous vow") acts as a scaffold rather than a meaningful motif.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose suffers from mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("Silas’s motivation was to wavelength align with purpose"), creating clunky, scaffold-like sentences. High density of "adjective-noun" pairings (stellar doubt, violet mist, ancient metal) creates a purple texture that obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with mixed metaphors and abstract phrasing treated as concrete ("cloak dripping with the sighs of unkept promises," "roar a sigh"). These constructions obscure clarity and reduce physical immediacy. The text relies on "X of Y" formulations (echo of sacrifice, veil of stars) that create a repetitive, melodramatic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive diction (multiple uses of "lukewarm" and "earnest") and static "to be" verb constructions ("was brittle," "was lukewarm"). The reliance on abstract summaries of emotional states reduces information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from semantic incoherence (a gait cannot be "precisely humane") and cliché density ("silver ribbon," "golden sunrise"). Logistical contradictions (midnight/twilight) and repetitive phrasing ("hush that fell... fell silent") undermine line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is weighed down by adjective-noun pairs and stock phrasing ("soft pages of a forgotten grimoire," "surged through her veins"). The density of "purple" descriptors ("kaleidoscopic," "phosphorescent," "amber hiss") creates a static, decorative texture that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=2.8)
    Significant line-level artifacts include redundant phrasing ("recalling... remembering through muscle memory") and the repetitive, nonsensical use of "soundless echo" (three times, including the final sentence). Clichés like "eyes wide with relief" and "metaphorical weight" further dilute the prose quality.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from abstraction and confused metaphors (a "blade" that is a "concept" yet physically slices glass). The text relies on "purple" descriptors ("air sang," "pulse that matched his own") that obscure the physical reality of the scene in favor of vague thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high simile density and "purple" overwriting (e.g., "petals unfurled like a map of constellations drawn in vapor," "whisper that rose... like a secret"). These constructions clog the pacing and obscure the imagery rather than sharpening it. The reliance on clichés ("rain fell in sheets," "sky... hold its breath") further weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.4)
    Imagery collapses under the weight of mixed metaphors, most notably a "blade of sound" that "macerates" silence into "ash" containing "fireflies." Prompt phrases are pasted in verbatim, causing tense clashes ("inhale... slips") and awkward appositions ("remained, true haunting") that disrupt the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is weighed down by tautological phrasing ("folding the cold wind into the warm folds") and oxymorons that blur rather than clarify ("foggy lucidity"). The repetition of the phrase "interiorizing exteriors" feels mechanical and disrupts the rhythm, calling attention to itself as an inserted constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant loop artifacts are present; the phrase "frozen bloom" is repeated four times in a short space, and "stoically sensitive" appears twice as a label. The prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and mixed metaphors ("heartbeat when fate's threads loosen"), obscuring the action.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant prose artifacts lower the grade: the tautological "spiral stairwell spiraling," the thrice-repeated "serenely electric," and abstract mixed metaphors ("scent of a shard of hush") obscure physical reality. These issues, combined with abstract filter verbs, stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.1)
    Significant penalties for text loops and scaffolding artifacts. The phrases "spectral grotto under starlight" and "resiliently positive" are repeated verbatim multiple times, and the prose relies on "and then" sequencing disguised by adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of abstract metaphors and adjectival stuffing ("realistically imaginary choreography") that obscures clarity. Prompt words are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm. The reliance on similes ("like water," "like a reminder," "like a canvas") creates a repetitive scaffold that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.6)
    Phrasing is often clunky or abstract ("balancedly curious," "pulsed like a low tide"). The prose relies on adjective-noun pairings ("somber marvel," "mournful blue") rather than strong verbs. The misuse of scientific terms (sonar detecting photons) acts as a significant logic flaw at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from high density of clichés ("fog of oblivion," "sunrise kissed the paper") and forced metaphors. The verbatim repetition of phrases like "reeling hush" and "persistently curious" creates lexical loops that damage the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally evocative but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("crashing hush" used twice as a frame) and some clunky syntactic integration of prompt terms ("codex margin illuminant gold fleck"). Imagery is dense, occasionally bordering on purple ("hulking mouth," "tiny suns"), but maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from over-adjectivization ("indifferent sky," "ephemeral patterns") that distances the reader. The reliance on abstract descriptors occasionally obscures the concrete physical action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but dense with adjectival ornamentation ("jagged spires," "perpetual dusk," "vanished syllables"), occasionally veering into purple territory. While the imagery is evocative, the reliance on summary over dramatized action flattens the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    The text suffers from severe artifacting due to the repetitive use of multi-word phrases ("gravitationally playful" x3, "untamed harmony" x3, "static-laden" x3). These loops disrupt the prose rhythm, creating a mechanical cadence that draws attention to the constraints rather than the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive, forced phrasing (the prompt phrase "resonantly soft" appears four times, becoming a distracting artifact). The writing relies on purple abstractions ("collective sigh of green," "hinted at forgotten dreams") rather than concrete, active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is purple and overwrought, dense with mixed metaphors ("banner of surrender," "electric sigh," "metallic bird"). Adverb-adjective clusters like "respectfully rebellious" weaken the imagery, and the reliance on personification for inanimate objects ("machines that seemed to listen") creates a barrier to immersion. The density of figurative language obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is overwrought and repetitive, with significant tautologies like "wind bells chimed inside the chime of wind bells." High density of adjective-noun pairings ("whispering gleam," "misting hush") and synonym churn creates a sluggish, ornamental rhythm that obscures action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is "purple" and heavily ornamented, often prioritizing sound over clarity ("fluttered like a forgotten stanza," "electronic sighs"). There is a high density of abstract metaphors that border on mixed (folding space into a Möbius strip of story via algorithms). The reliance on adjective-noun pairings reduces momentum and creates a lush but static texture.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of forced phrases ("vitalize" appears four times; "luminous absence" three times) and purple descriptors. These artifacts clutter the lines and obstruct momentum, making the text read like a checklist of required terms rather than a cohesive story.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is saturated with abstract metaphors and clichés ("unfolded like a sigh," "hummed with possibilities") that obscure physical action and create a "purple" texture. The high density of abstract nouns performing verbs violates clarity standards and results in significant overwriting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is weighed down by filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt," "she thought") and abstract modifiers ("relentless push," "profound"). The density of adjectives slows momentum, and the reliance on "telling" internal states reduces line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive metaphor density ("edges sharpening like the blade of a promise," "routes of hope") that obscures meaning. Repetitive phrasing ("reversible exile," "combative tenderness") acts as scaffolding, and the reliance on abstract similes prevents the physical scene from grounding the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=1.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts (four uses of "succor," three of "radiant hush," two of "insatiably creative") disrupt the prose flow and signal forced prompt adherence. The density of purple prose ("misty sigh," "crystal beads") obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant repetition of prompt phrases ("interlaced hush" x3, "lucid unrest" x3) and abstract nouns creates a looping, tautological effect (e.g., "hush that accumulates silence"). The prose is often purple, prioritizing sound over clarity, and the density of abstract adjectives weakens the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("silence" or "silent" appears eight times) and the verbatim repetition of prompt labels ("methodically curious," "shielded openness") within the text. These artifacts disrupt the flow and highlight artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but dense with "scaffolding" metaphors that explain the plot's meaning rather than letting it unfold. Figurative language often clutters the action (e.g., filaments "like a human hope"), reducing the immediacy of the physical work.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on abstract nouns and adjective stacking ("tinkersong of electric hues," "living cipher") that obscures concrete action. The use of specific prompt phrases like "driftingly alert" feels mechanical, and the density of figurative language creates a "purple" texture that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from heavy "purple" overwriting ("prismatic shards," "warmly inquisitive") and reliance on stock metaphors. The grammar fails at a critical juncture with the tense error ("as the elevator climbs... began"), and the density of adjectives slows momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts: "quiet/quietly" appears nine times; specific phrases like "quietly explosive" and "spooled wholeness" are repeated verbatim. Metaphors are often mixed or strained ("lenses catching starlight like dust"), and the prose density obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is competent but suffers from keyword stuffing, with the clumsy noun phrase "secret book safe" appearing three times. Line-level logic is occasionally blurry, such as the confusion over whether she brought the safe or found it hidden.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.4)
    A clear typo ("polyglut") and the verbatim repetition of "sociable isolation" in the opening and closing paragraphs create visible friction. The prose frequently leans on adverb-adjective pairings ("diligently curious") that reduce momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.4)
    A severe over-reliance on similes (occurring in nearly every sentence) disrupts momentum and creates a repetitive syntactic drone. Figurative language often breaks logical coherence, such as a coat "frayed like old driftwood" (wood does not fray) or "weight like a heartbeat."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but heavily ornamental, relying on sentimental phrasing ("trembling like a heart beat," "brambled hope") that sometimes creates a purple texture. While the grammar is sound, the high density of adjectives and abstract metaphors slows momentum without adding necessary narrative information.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=2.5)
    Significant loop artifacts and synonym churn severely damage the prose. The phrase "bruised awe" is repeated three times, "pane of hush" five times, and "nested patterns" three times, creating a robotic, templated cadence. Syntactic errors ("stone ribs bruised awe") and cliché metaphors ("breath a thin thread of frost") further degrade the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose flows well rhythmically but suffers from cliché imagery ("retreats like a dying dragon") and forced phrasing ("fitting offhandedly exact") that disrupts grammatical logic. These artifacts undercut the otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from simile density ("like intertwined strands," "like a filament") and cliché ("echoing the pulse of her own heartbeat"). The required phrase "As the pieces fall into place" is inserted awkwardly, creating a temporal logic error where the result precedes the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting, mixed metaphors ("pulse like a shy sunrise"), and repetitive sentence structures. Prompt keywords are shoehorned in (e.g., "mindfully scattered" used as an adverb-adjective pair), creating visible text artifacts that clutter the lines and obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is generally evocative but marred by mixed metaphors (cooking vs. sandpaper vs. tides) and diagnostic telling ("remorse was emotionally contagious"). The repetition of the "sandpaper" phrasing feels clunky and jarring against the established culinary motif.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("interspersed languages," "borrowed starlight," "vigorous/tender") drags the prose quality down. The writing leans on purple descriptions and label-adjectives ("empathetically decisive") instead of concrete action verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.0)
    Prose is dense with mixed metaphors and abstract "overwriting" artifacts ("liquid quartz," "handwriting spiraling like DNA") that obscure clarity. High use of filter verbs ("Aria felt," "She saw") and asserted emotion ("breath trembling," "heart quaked") weakens immediacy. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings creates a sluggish, ornamental rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from significant redundancy ("vaulted vaults") and the clumsy, repetitive forcing of prompt phrases ("manuscript margin doodle" appears three times as a full stack). "Stepped through the threshold effects" treats an abstract concept as a physical door, breaking semantic logic. The repetition of "clandestinely luminous" and "latent blaze" creates a distracting drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=2.5)
    Basic grammatical consistency fails with frequent tense errors (e.g., &quot;vibration traces&quot; after &quot;Auris placed&quot;). The prose suffers from purple artifacts and the forced, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases (&quot;intensely quiet,&quot; &quot;after the hedgehog uncurls&quot;) which disrupts rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=2.8)
    Significant craft flaws appear in the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases; "hopeful melancholy" appears four times as a label, and the awkward noun phrase "polished basalt worry stone dent" is repeated three times. The prose is dense with abstract adjectives and filter verbs ("he sensed," "he realized") that dull immediacy. These artifacts severely hamper flow and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from extreme simile density (six "like" constructions in close proximity) and overwritten descriptors. The phrase "his intuition intuitively descriptive" is a tautological artifact that disrupts clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant repetition of prompt phrases ("undercurrent of wisdom," "wildflower hush") creates a mechanical rhythm. The prose suffers from awkward diction ("journalize") and abstract genitive phrases that obscure concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on "like [noun]" similes (coral, balloons, kelp, emerald fire), creating a repetitive syntactic pattern. The phrase "whirling silence" is repeated three times in a short space, reading more as a forced motif than a developing image.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose relies on "telling" adjectives and clichéd similes ("trembling like a nervous heart," "shadows stretching like hopeful fingers") that weaken the imagery. While mechanically functional, the writing drifts into purple description ("ghostly vortex") instead of relying on concrete, specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple" overwriting and repetitive phrasing (e.g., "sculpted hush," "unfettered," and "oscillating repose" repeat frequently in a short space). Several phrases feel mechanically inserted to meet prompt requirements, disrupting the natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.1)
    Line-level quality is marred by redundancy ("distant rumble of distant storms") and awkward phrasing forced by the prompt elements ("each uncase moment"). The prose tends toward abstraction, using metaphors that sound profound but lack concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is marred by tautologies ("veil of night thinned like parchment"), mixed metaphors (music, math, and printing conflated confusingly), and excessive repetition of key phrases like "vanishing stars." These artifacts, along with abstract descriptors, create a sluggish rhythm and reduce line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by simile overload and "thesaurus-itis" (e.g., "sunrise-kissed leaves," "liquid glass"). Specific prompt words like "germinate" and "vibrate" are repeated mechanically, creating a jarring echo that feels forced rather than woven into the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is overwrought with purple descriptors ("perfume of rain," "veil of silver") and mixed metaphors that obscure clarity. The text relies heavily on telling and filter verbs ("Liora felt," "she knew"), and key prompt phrases feel mechanically inserted rather than woven into the syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe loop artifacts ("stoically sparkling" x3, "raveling silence" x3) and purple phrasing ("breath of an ancient loom") that prioritizes ornamentation over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten and heavy with adjective-noun pairings ("reverent rhythm," "defiant color," "sturdy hope"), creating a dense, purple texture that obscures clarity. Abstract metaphors ("rubble that haunted his dreams") replace concrete imagery, and the rhythm becomes monotonous. The text relies on telling ("His hands moved quietly determined") where showing is required.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is overwrought and suffers from "purple" tendencies ("breaths caught like pearls," "rusted hulls whispered"). Repetitive phrasing of prompt elements ("cyclically spontaneous," "murmur of half-remembered dreams") creates noticeable text artifacts that disrupt the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is laden with "purple" abstractions ("luminescent ache," "trapped sunrise") and relies heavily on weak adverb-adjective pairings ("warmly observant," "cold, uneasy silence"). The "dared to care" rhyme in the final beat undermines the intended gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("bending each photon like a whispered promise") and purple abstractions ("chorus of silver syllables"). The capitalization of inserted terms acts as a recurring seam artifact. Figuration often obscures clarity rather than sharpening the image (e.g., "living serpent of light" slithering on "sapphire currents").

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers significantly from "purple" overwriting and the forced, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("quietly explosive" appears four times; "iridescent caution" three times). These repetitions read as artifacts rather than motifs. Mixed metaphors ("ribbons of light," "humming" stone, "singing" flowers) clutter the sentence level and obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose relies heavily on repetition (variations of "quantified sorrow" appear frequently) and purple descriptors. The integration of the required phrase "at the moment a pin is heard..." results in a syntactically awkward and logically contradictory sentence that disrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("loom of woven dawns," "breathing cathedral") and relies on clichés like "moths to flame" and "unseen hand." The overwrought, adjectival style ("purple prose") obscures causality and slows the narrative momentum significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.4)
    Grammar is functional, but the prose is dense with clichés (&quot;blank as fresh snow,&quot; &quot;weight of centuries&quot;) and strained metaphors (&quot;ink smeared like a secret sigh&quot;). The phrase &quot;enlarged tranquility&quot; is repeated awkwardly, appearing as a forced insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetition of specific multi-word phrases ("heuristically gentle," "tenuous absolution," "uncloak") functions as scaffolding artifacts that drag down the prose. These phrases appear to be forced insertions that do not blend with the sentence structure, resulting in a rhythmic stutter and a lack of lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("quartz hush" x4, "luminous vows" x5) creates a mechanical, looped rhythm that severely distracts from the flow. Mixed metaphors ("clouds shedding shards... like needles") and label-heavy descriptions further reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.2)
    The text suffers from severe phrase repetition loops: "truce of hush" (5x), "false starts" (4x), "antique watch fob" (4x), and "comforting unease" (3x) appear with distracting frequency in a short space. These verbatim repetitions act as scaffolding artifacts that drag down the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from "telling" disguised as metaphor ("felt like a future remembered," "motivation was simple yet profound") and clunky phrasing ("terrestrially cosmic"). While the rhythm is functional, the density of adjectives and mixed metaphors (scent as binary code) hampers momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=2.8)
    Significant overwriting and purple prose artifacts ("dangling like a lost promise", "silence's secret heart") obscure clarity. The specific phrase "auroral sorrow" is repeated three times, creating a jarring lexical loop that flattens the intended tone.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures (a high frequency of "She [verb]" openers) that create a monotonous rhythm. Additionally, the metaphor density is cloying ("breathing misty sighs," "ink shimmered like sunrise," "walls close like lungs"), resulting in overwriting that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant repetition of keywords ("glisten," "wonder," "truth") creates a "template cadence"; a subject-verb agreement error ("arm that glisten") and abstract noun overuse reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with mixed metaphors ("tasting the faint scent," "stars... like fractured glass") and abstract adjectives. "Purple" artifacts ("throbbed," "pulsed," "whispered") clutter the sentences and obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=2.1)
    Severe repetition artifacts present; "sandstorm calm" appears five times and "locked mailbox mystery" three times in a short space, reading like forced keyword insertions. The prose suffers from synonym churn and abstract phrasing ("metal’s cool memory," "narrative pulse") that obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is purple and repetitive, with the "spider" simile appearing twice ("time unfolded as a spider", "ocean, like a patient spider") within a short space. The forced insertion of prompt words results in grammatical artifacts like "the act of liberate," and "calm defiance" is repeated to the point of redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from "purple" abstraction and mixed metaphors ("sand fell away like sifted dreams," "tide's breath hardened") that obscure physical reality. The reliance on abstract similes and high-concept phrasing halts momentum, prioritizing decorative lyricism over clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and cliché ("gentle flame," "whispered secrets"). Prompt phrases like "terrestrially cosmic" are shoehorned in awkwardly ("terrestrially cosmic conduit," "terrestrially cosmic thread"), creating jarring text artifacts that disrupt the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is dense with abstract metaphors ("stitch the night's fleeting light") that obscure the physical action; the high density of adjectives slows momentum. The repeated phrasing of "patiently nimble" stands out as a visible artifact of insertion rather than a natural description.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose suffers severely from repetitive loops and "scaffold" artifacts, repeating complex phrases like "ghostly resolve," "tragically radiant," and "resonance structures" 3–5 times each in a short space. These verbatim repetitions of prompt elements clutter the text and destroy narrative momentum, triggering maximum artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is severely marred by "artifacting," specifically the verbatim repetition of full prompt phrases ("heritage rose thorn" x4, "calibrated treason" x4, "key with no apparent lock" x3). This creates a mechanical, fill-in-the-blanks rhythm that disrupts immersion ("synonym churn" penalty). While grammatically functional, the reliance on these static noun phrases prevents flow and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with mixed metaphors (a reed bending to sharpen a hue) and filter verbs ("she believed," "she felt"). Key phrases from the prompt are inserted awkwardly as literal narration ("webs of intrigue spun by hidden constellations"), disrupting the logic of the sentence. The reliance on abstract nouns over concrete verbs creates a sluggish, "told" experience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is overwritten with dense, sometimes mixed metaphors ("weaving... filaments through a loom of memory") that prioritize ornament over clarity. A high frequency of abstract descriptors and filter verbs clutters the sentences, slowing momentum and obscuring the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose suffers significantly from "synonym churn" and the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" both appear multiple times). This repetition creates a mechanical rhythm and highlights the artificiality of the construction. The density of figurative language obscures rather than reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is serviceable but repetitive, with phrases like “comfortable lies” and “stillpoint” appearing frequently without accruing new meaning. The writing leans on slightly clichéd descriptors (“wounded star”) and lacks the density required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose is severely compromised by "artifact stuffing," with multi-word prompt phrases repeated excessively (e.g., "variant allegiance" 5x, "fragmented radio frequencies" 4x, "cobalt glass portico" 4x) in a short space. This creates a robotic, looped rhythm that destroys immersion and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is overwritten with mixed metaphors ("sky cracked open with a... hymn") and repetitive sentence structures. The timeline error (sunset to sunrise in adjacent beats) and the repetitive use of the word "sweeten" demonstrate a lack of line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is dense with clashing metaphors ("fleshly ethereal glow") and redundant adjectives ("fleeting golden sunset"). Repetitive sentence structures ("She [verb]") create a monotonous rhythm, and the overuse of "purple" modifiers obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from density without propulsion, relying on "purple" metaphors ("glowed like a memory of storms") that obscure clarity. Significant repetition of key phrases ("restrained wildness," "patient revolution," "unyoke") acts as a scaffold rather than a motif.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive, forced insertion of prompt phrases ("reverberate," "empirical observation," "fortified vulnerability") which creates a stuttering, scaffolded rhythm. Metaphors are often mixed or abstract to the point of opacity ("droplets... like memories entangled").

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=2.5)
    The text suffers from severe repetition of specific phrases ("vibrant hush," "calm before realization," "by the way light breaks"), which appear verbatim multiple times, creating a distracted, cut-and-paste rhythm. These loops act as technical artifacts that break immersion and obscure the causal logic of the sentences they inhabit.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is burdened by excessive personification ("gears shudder in delighted disbelief," "wheels humming like sarcastic philosophers") and strained similes that clutter the imagery. This stylistic density obscures the action and reduces the world to a cartoonish, anthropomorphic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from repetitive word echoes ("fabricated a lie... fabricated tribute," "echoing verses... echo of forgotten songs") and melodramatic phrasing. The brevity of the piece forces a synopsis-like pace that prevents line-level textural depth.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten with adjective-heavy phrases ("wavering glow," "quiet light") and lacks strong, active verbs. Several phrases appear to be inserted directly from a prompt list ("courageous anomaly," "during the weighted breath before reply") in a way that disrupts syntactic rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is severely overwritten, with figurative language appearing in almost every sentence ("folded a new layer of patience into my marrow," "gripped reality loosely like a whisper"). This density of mixed metaphor creates a "purple" haze that blocks clarity and momentum. Repetitive phrasing ("fold in patience," "sound of endings") acts as a scaffold rather than a motif.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetitive looping of specific phrases ("passionate subtlety," "gently persuasive," "drawing parallels") creates a mechanical, checklist texture. Mixed metaphors ("bruised violet," "liquid memory") and essayist language damage immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on simile chains ("like wind through reeds," "like a secret tide," "like dew") which creates density without propulsion. Several prompt phrases appear as unintegrated labels ("strangely honest simplicity") rather than embodied description.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés and mixed metaphors ("stitched together into a soothing whole," "scent of lavender and the faint hum of memory"). Sentences frequently loop in emotional redundancy, offering abstract assertions of beauty instead of concrete, propelling action.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts are present; specific multi-word phrases ("suspended hush," "sonically reflective," "weathered innocence") are repeated 2–3 times each in a short text. Logic breaks occur in phrasing (e.g., "fractured sequences that fractured time"), and the prose density is low due to reliance on abstract adjectives over concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.1)
    Repetitive imagery ("tide of longing" x2, "tide" x5, "sigh" x3) and metaphor stacking clutter the prose; the recurrence of "tide" as a descriptor creates noticeable synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant text artifacts mar the prose; specific phrases like "luminous ache" (5x) and "changelessly constant" (3x) are looped excessively for this length. These repetitions act as scaffolding rather than motifs, disrupting the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is weighed down by modifier congestion ("decisively kind grace," "quiet duty") and clunky phrasing. A jarring tense shift ("after the blood work comes back" in a past-tense narration) disrupts the flow, and the repetitive use of phrases like "pulsing stillness" dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is polished but marred by clichés ("simple yet profound," "whispered through open arches") and repetitive phrasing ("quietly deliberate" appears three times). The line "spoons bent reality" is tonally jarring and awkward. The writing feels functional and safe, lacking the density and propulsion of high-level literary craft.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacts; distinctive phrases like "shrewdly innocent" and "cleft in certainty" are repeated verbatim three times each in a short space. The writing leans heavily on purple descriptors ("breathed midnight perfume," "luminous pattern") instead of concrete, active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive phrasing (text artifacts), including multiple uses of "reflectively vibrant," "zephyr bloom," "pearl of stillness," and "without fire" in close proximity. These loops, combined with heavy adjective padding ("quiet longing," "swirling echoes"), stifle narrative momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from text artifacts and loop penalties, specifically the excessive repetition of "honeyed hush" (5+ times) and "protected vulnerability" (3 times). The word "proffer" is used frequently and somewhat awkwardly to satisfy the prompt, disrupting the natural rhythm of the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=2.6)
    Basic subject-verb agreement errors ("She solemnize") appear twice in pivotal moments, rendering the prose unpublishable. The text is dense with "as-if" similes and abstract metaphors that obscure rather than reveal meaning ("air pulse like a held breath," "page that trembles like a heartbeat"). Repetitive phrasing ("swirling hush," "lucidly watchful") indicates a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is overwritten and repetitive, with "golden" appearing five times and "ancient" four times in a short space. Metaphors are often decorative ("notes rose like sunbeams") rather than functional, and the reliance on abstract nouns ("covenant," "promise," "essence") reduces density.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose. The phrase "moving stillness" appears four times, "safekept starlight" three times, and "patience/patient" four times in a short text, creating a looping, robotic cadence. These text loops, combined with dense adjectival clutter, obstruct narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from significant summary artifacts ("He then spent hours," "He decided to") that drain momentum, alongside a reliance on filter verbs ("sensed," "felt," "believed"). The diction leans toward the melodramatic ("echo of centuries in every vein," "bruised by frost and flame"), resulting in a dense, ornamental style that obscures rather than reveals the action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from awkward construction ("boundary-lessly") and noticeable repetition of specific descriptor phrases ("shingled hush" x3, "whalebone reverie" x3) that act as text artifacts. Metaphor density is high but often mixed or abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is dense with mixed metaphors and "purple" descriptors that obscure clarity ("steam traced silver veins... marking time that seemed crystallized"). A significant grammatical error occurs where the prompt phrase "while the kettle boils" (present) is pasted into a past-tense sentence ("The kettle began to sing..."), breaking the timeline. The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, suffering from high metaphor density that obscures concrete action (e.g., "tears... each a tiny bead of regret"). Almost every noun carries a modifier, creating a slow, adjectival rhythm that drags on momentum. The sentimentality of the imagery ("metallic heart," "quilt of regrets") leans into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from heavy "genitive metaphor" overload ("maze of intentions," "lattice of intention pathways," "framework of possibility"), which obscures concrete action. These artifacts reduce clarity and momentum, replacing sensory grounding with abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=1.5)
    This category fails due to a catastrophic proofreading error: a full paragraph is repeated verbatim. Additionally, the text is riddled with excessive repetition ("excruciatingly gentle" appears six times) and purple prose ("exhaled a soundless echo") that obscures clarity. These artifacts suggest a lack of basic editorial oversight.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe repetition of mandatory phrases (e.g., "thoughtfully clear" and "serene upheaval" each appear three times) creates a stuttering, checklist-like rhythm. The prose is cluttered with abstract metaphors and adjective-noun pairings that stifle momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is severely overwritten, suffering from "purple prose" and metaphor congestion that obscures clarity ("coat a muted echo," "whispered a pulse," "twist a syllable"). Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, often mixing metaphors ("breath held by the sea," "pale spine") or relying on abstract clichés ("mind ripple like water"). This density stalls momentum and turns the text into a series of ornaments rather than a functional narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers heavily from "prompt-glomming," inserting required phrases verbatim ("vivid description," "intimate projection") as labels rather than integrating them. Significant repetition of the phrase "geography of healing" (four times) and adjective-heavy scaffold sentences stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant artifact drag due to the threefold repetition of specific phrases ("quaking reverie," "bitterly sweet") within a short space, creating a looped, templated effect. Additionally, the density of adjectives and metaphors ("rivet and rivulet," "violin string") often obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe overwriting and "purple prose" artifacts obscure clarity ("inhaled the salty kelp-drift peace," "gracefully alert step," "liquid midnight"). Metaphors are mixed and strained ("scars can sing," "foreign coin... humming"). The density of adjectives and abstract nouns acting as agents halts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant overwriting and purple prose ("river of forgotten lullabies," "unstick the impossible") obscure clarity and stall momentum. Forced phrasing like "realistically imaginative spirit" clutters the sentence rhythm, and mixed metaphors ("time slipped a gear" vs. "rhythm of stars") confuse the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is marred by subject-verb disagreement ("equations that approximates") and significant repetitive synonym churn (pulse/pulsed, echo/echoing, generational). The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("mournful tides," "silent cascade," "luminous mist") creates a dense, sluggish rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from "metaphor muddle" ("shivered stone") and repetitive oxymorons ("thundering calm" appears twice). Heavy adjectival layering and abstract phrasing obscure clarity and stall narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is heavily burdened by "purple" artifacts, mixed metaphors, and clichés ("frayed tapestry of time," "gears of destiny," "shards of glass," "painted the horizon with fire"). Information density is low due to synonym churn and abstract descriptors that occupy space without advancing the plot. The reliance on adjective-heavy abstraction obscurs the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetition artifacts: "velveteen gloom" (3x), "cobalt silo" (3x), and "antique sovereign case" (3x) create a checklist cadence. The prose is dense with loops that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive artifacting, specifically the threefold use of the awkward phrase "groundedly imaginative" and the twofold insertion of "before the pen meets the blank page." Metaphors often lean toward abstraction ("chill that sang of hidden possibilities") rather than concrete imagery. The reliance on adjective-heavy telling slows momentum and distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant artifacting, specifically the verbatim repetition of "thistled calm" (three times) and "secretly luminous" (two times), which reads as forced constraint checking. The writing is often overwrought with mixed metaphors ("soothing the dust that hung like old parchment") and lacks the rhythmic variation needed for a story about music.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, with nearly every sentence carrying a simile or metaphor ("like broken hopes," "breathing out memories," "like frozen breaths"). This high density of figurative language obscures clarity and creates a "template cadence" (Subject [verbed] [simile]) that drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.8)
    The text is presented as a single dense block, denying the reader pacing control or visual rhythm. The prose relies heavily on abstract nominalizations ("complacency," "ingenuity," "ambition") rather than concrete, active verbs, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition (the word "velvet" is used five times as a descriptor) and purple phrasing that obscures clarity. Prompt integration forces ungrammatical or clunky constructions ("Across unlearning hatred, the townspeople had gathered"), disrupting flow and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten, relying heavily on abstract metaphors ("salt of forgotten seas," "symphony of hope") and clichéd simile structures that slow momentum. The density of adjectives and personification ("vines... shedding dead tendrils with a sound like soft applause") often obscures the physical reality of the scene in favor of poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from cliché metaphors ("fell like rain," "wound on the city's heart") and "purple" overwriting ("electric nectar"). The rhythm is monotonous, and the reliance on abstract descriptors ("dormant energy," "hidden fireworks") distances the reader from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=2.9)
    Presenting the story as a single, massive block of text destroys pacing and readability. The prose is overwritten with dense, mixed metaphors ("salty lullaby," "amber halos... like lazy thoughts") that prioritize poetic posturing over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is heavily overwritten ("purple"), relying on abstract metaphors and adjective-heavy diction that obscures action. Significant repetition of key phrases ("cascading revelations," "incisively kind," "nuance") and sentence structures creates a monotonous, unpolished rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract noun clusters ("kinetic potential," "geometry of probability") and repetitive modifiers ("silent promise," "silent applause," "quiet rupture"). The unidiomatic phrase "balancedly daring" appears twice, disrupting rhythm and drawing attention to the writing's artifice rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is often overwritten, relying on mixed metaphors ("sparked daydreams... like gentle tides") and cliché phrases ("smog lingered like a heavy sigh"). While some imagery is vivid, the density of figurative language occasionally stalls narrative momentum and obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is heavily overwritten and repetitive, with the phrase "rosewater dread" appearing multiple times as a fixed label. Metaphors are often mixed or confusing ("strokes unfurled like ribbons of water... echoing the waterfall"), and cliche phrasing ("trembling hands," "melting like frost") dilutes the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is severely marred by the forced repetition of specific phrases; "bleak exhilaration" appears three times and "latent radiance" four times in a short space. These repetitions read as clumsy constraints rather than intentional motifs, disrupting the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is severely compromised by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("lingering luminance" appears six times; "photographically cursed" five times). These repetitions create distracting artifacts that break the narrative flow and obscure the action, particularly at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.2)
    Line-level craft suffers from tautology ("generated by fractal generating"), redundancy ("lingering hum that lingered"), and filter verbs ("seemed to applaud"). Repeated phrasing ("restless euphony") and abstract telling dilute the prose's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but decorative, with some logical slips ("bronze ribs of iron"—contradictory materials and singular/plural mismatch) and pleonasms ("shadowy silhouettes"). Adjective-noun pairings occasionally drift into cliché ("sapphire sea").

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("noble lies" appears six times; "pit of lies" three times) and abstract adjectives. The writing is dense with scaffolding that tells the reader how to interpret the imagery rather than letting the image stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe text artifacts and repetition penalties apply. Full phrases are looped multiple times ("antique traveling inkwell" x4, "archeologist of abandoned dreams" x2, "interlaced absence" x3, "hushed blaze" variants x3). This scaffold repetition creates a robotic cadence that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.9)
    Prose is marred by severe repetition of stock phrases; "antique ink stamp" appears five times, and abstract metaphors clutter the text. The writing tells rather than shows, using density-reducing scaffold and flowery abstractions that obscure the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition of prompt phrases creates text artifacts; &quot;luminous torment&quot; appears four times, and the &quot;ascend/descend&quot; paradox is restated frequently, turning key concepts into clunky refrains. The register slip &quot;starship&quot; disrupts the mood. Repetitive sentence structures (&quot;He [verb]...&quot;) in the middle section stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.3)
    Sentence structures suffer from template cadence ("He had learned," "He adjusted," "He sensed," "He realized"), creating a repetitive rhythm. The verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("intangibly tangible," "unfiltered awakening") constitutes a distracting text artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts lower the score, with phrases like "brilliant dimness," "star trails," and "missing pieces" looping frequently across paragraphs. The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns and adjective stuffing that reduces information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive diction and lexical loops, specifically the overuse of the word "quell" (three times) and the phrases "sieved hush" and "cobalt terrace" (multiple times). These repetitions read as forced prompt insertions rather than organic language, and the metaphor density often obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetitive artifacts (specific phrases repeated 4-5 times in <800 words) and purple prose ("air itself might betray his doubts," "silent metronome") lower the quality. The confusion between literal and metaphorical action in the "rope" sentence disrupts clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=2.8)
    Forced integration of prompt phrases results in glaring grammatical errors ("an instinctive gravitate," "moment when expectations collapse" in a past-tense sentence). The prose suffers from mixed metaphors and "purple" descriptions ("stitching the ragged edges of his past") that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose relies heavily on cliché metaphors ("veins of a heart," "clean slate," "tapestry of humanity"). The required phrase "delicately robust" is inserted awkwardly, once with a hyphen ("delicate-robust") and once as an abstract modifier ("delicately robust promise"), highlighting the lack of integration.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.9)
    Line-level execution suffers from adjective stuffing ("silvered mist," "luminous grove") and grammatical awkwardness ("moved paradoxically steady" lacks the adverbial form). The verbatim insertion of "fortune from cookie" without an article reads as a raw prompt artifact that disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.7)
    Prose is heavily laden with adjectival compounds ("onyx-ink," "cloud-woven") and mixed metaphors ("choking beauty that wrapped the soul in velvet") that obscure clarity. The verbatim repetition of the phrase "choking beauty" feels like a forced scaffold artifact rather than a rhythmic motif, and the reliance on abstract nouns ("sorrow," "hope," "redemption") weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is marred by significant repetitive diction, with five variations of "shimmer" and multiple uses of "tear" and "ghost" appearing in a short space. High metaphorical density and adjective-heavy phrasing ("shimmery images," "pale wind," "tender steps") clog the rhythm and obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple" overwriting and metaphor abuse (e.g., "skittered like a miniature comet," "silence fell like a veil"). Tautologies ("whispering hush") and abstract nouns clutter the sentences, reducing information density and clarity. The reliance on similes ("like," "as if") distances the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose is overwritten with mixed metaphors ("humming with a faint phosphorescent pulse") and suffers from significant repetition artifacts. The mechanical reuse of specific phrases ("bronze quill holder," "winking hush") creates a distracting, rhythmic loop.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but repetitive, particularly with the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("borrowed dawn," "lingering promise") which appear multiple times as static labels. Adjective-noun pairings are dense and occasionally clog the rhythm ("elusive eel herder," "collapsed star dust," "sacred patterns").

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple" over-writing and oxymoronic descriptors ("furiously tranquil") that obscure meaning. There are repetitive loops (both "furiously tranquil" and "storm-kissed" appear twice), and the density of abstract metaphors ("swirl a new stanza," "electric scent") stifles narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures and awkward artifacts, such as "waiting while waiting" and the ungrammatical use of "diplomatically fierce." High-concept metaphors ("swords forged from ideas") obscure the physical action, and the text loops on the "questions/destinations" phrase, reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from high-density overwriting and mixed metaphors ("voice a trembling candle," "drawing lines like a pulse") that obscure the physical action. The relentless use of poetic diction ("luminous fracture" repeated) creates a purple texture that prioritizes sound over clarity and grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetition of noun phrases creates a mechanical, stuttering rhythm; "broken anniversary clock" appears six times and "tidal arbor" four times in a very short text. The phrase "steely longing" is repeated three times as a tell. These "scaffold loops" destroy immersion and suggest a checklist approach to drafting.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is polished but dense with "purple" metaphors and noun-heavy descriptions ("language of thunder," "silvered pages turning in a wind of thought") that obscure immediacy. The rhythm is somewhat monotonous, with a tendency toward "X like Y" constructions that feel like stylistic artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is saturated with artifacts: clichéd modifiers ("wind-kissed," "gentle"), abstract noun phrases ("tides of remembrance"), and adverb-heavy constructions ("rhythmically placid"). The story loops repetitively (instruction -> nature responds) and relies on "telling" through metaphor rather than showing through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies with short declarative sentences in dawn scenes, but paraphrase loops on "amplified quiet" and "gently persistent" (e.g., repeated in declarations) create minor churn dulling peak density; figurative language coherent but dense in closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density propels but figurative overload in climax ("exhale turned violet... fog curling like sentient blanket... walls woven from threads") mixes vehicles without full pattern payoff, dulling peak slightly. Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops or scaffolds obscure cause.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density propels via integrated image-action (vines "pulsed a soft luminescence"), but figurative piling ("Möbius strip of foliage," "vaporous threads") risks coherence in sustained lyric beats; minor dissolve/disintegrate paraphrase loops purposeful yet drag slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies with scene (short clicks amid longer imagery); density high, metaphors purposeful like "skeletal witnesses." Minor overwrite in repeated grace phrasing (−0.4), but no loops or artifacts dull closure seed image. Propulsion strong to wall sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "sparks that fell like rain... each spark a tiny imprint" advances image/action/theme). Minor paraphrase loops ("returned... nightly," forge repetition) but purposeful accumulative; no closure muddle, rhythm varies read-aloud. Template cadence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    Figurative density overwrites most sentences including climax ("cascade onto the wick, igniting a flame of pure illumination"), dulling propulsion without patterned payoff; "luminous/glow/light" synonym loops and repetitive poetic stems reduce information density.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    High density with vivid propulsion, but −0.5 for paraphrase loops (repetitive "thawing heart" and "weighty lightness" across beats without fresh pressure) and template cadence in narrated actions ("I lift... I breathe"); metaphors cohere without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    Heavy figurative density in climax ("amber fire ripple," "trembling drum") without pattern payoff obscures propulsion; repetitive "sigh/groan" and "trembling certainty" loops dull peak lever moment; syntax varies but synonym churn evident.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Poetic rhythm propels but hush/ambered repetitions create paraphrase loops dulling mapping propulsion ("ambered hush" x4, "marbled hush" x3); figurative density risks coherence without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "servomotors humming a low rhythm that matched the courtyard’s breath"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density (comets, aurora) in climax but coherent; no loops obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density propels via varied rhythm, but repetitive "ambiguously clear" phrasing (4x) creates minor loop without escalation payoff, bordering artifact in closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.1)
    Heavy figurative density ("blooming withering symphony," "tiny sun," "lattice of truth") in response beats overwhelms propulsion and risks mixed coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.7)
    Repetitive phrasing loops ("icy warmth" 5x, "magnetic nexus at twilight" 3x, "hush of beating wings at rest" 2x, "subdued awakenings" 2x) create paraphrase churn obscuring propulsion in climax cascade; overwriting mixes metaphors like "violin bow on frozen strings" without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with purposeful figurative layering (lanterns "trembling like breath on wet wood") taught early, propels to climax without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in "wordless conversation" echoes dull momentum slightly, but closure image clear.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with multi-job lines (wind sways antennae like vines advances atmosphere/causality); minor figurative density in reflective beats (auroral sorrow recurs) but pattern coherent, no loops obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Paraphrase loops ("drowsy alertness"/"ghost shift" x4+, confession restated late) and dense figuratives ("frozen syllables"/"emotional tonnage") across beats dull propulsion (-1.2); template echoes in repetitive stems harm closure image clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density with vivid propulsion, but minor overwrite in metaphors ("stone floor softened... air thick," clustered in descent) risks coherence without payoff; no loops, rhythm varies naturally to charged final exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density in eclipse beat, vivid propulsion via pulsing shadow. Minor paraphrase loops ("cautious exuberance" x3, "softly adaptive" echoes) and repetitive phrasing like "hush" dull some momentum without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density integrates action/sensory/prose rhythm without loops, though "bronze quiet" motif risks template feel but teaches pattern early for payoff; figurative coherence (compass shards, low tide vibration) propels without muddle in peak chamber beat; varied syntax breathes with scene.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Figurative density high but coherent in lyric pattern ("spiral that mirrored the beam"); minor synonym churn on "secrets" across embedding beat dulls propulsion slightly, no loops touching closure; rhythm varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Purposeful simile/riddle density taught early pays off in illumination without muddle; minor motif repeats like "unraveling stillness" propel texturally without loop drag.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    High density with multi-job lines, but figurative overload in climax ("shards of light that cascaded down the spire, each shard a baton") mixes vehicles and risks coherence; minor paraphrase loops on "mirrored horizon" dull propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motif-driven figurative density propels but paraphrase loops in repeated pulse/glow phrasing ("tablet pulsed... glowed brighter") dull momentum; no closure harm.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Repetitive paraphrase loops ("mist" 10+ echoes, "swirl/hush/pulse" churn across beats) and template cadence (e.g., "She [moved/action] like [simile]" runs) dull propulsion, obscuring escalation density; figurative overload in peak gathering (−1.2). Closure image legible despite artifacts. High info density offset by synonym redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    High figurative density ("notes rose like sunbeams...golden threads spiraled") borders overwriting in climax beat, dulling propulsion slightly; minor paraphrase loops ("forgotten songs" thrice in close proximity). Rhythm varies read-aloud, but synonym churn ("light" motifs) adds scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.3)
    Repetitive paraphrase loops ("moving stillness" x3, orchard inhale x2, glow pulses/steadies across paragraphs) and template cadence in descriptive runs dull propulsion; metaphor density overwrites high-pressure flare beat without payoff. Synonym churn in light descriptors (luminous, quiet fire, starlight). Closure image slightly muddled by redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with multi-job lines like gear-crystal insertion; rhythm varies read-aloud, though minor figurative density in "chorus that seemed to ripple" borders overwrite without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    Overwriting via repetitive motifs ("shingled hush" 5x, "whalebone reverie" 3x) creates paraphrase loops dulling high-pressure ritual beats; figurative density lacks pattern payoff in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    High density with multi-job lines (steam veins marking time), but patterned repetition (kettle sings/boils, rust-hued thrice) risks loop in final third, dulling propulsion slightly. Figurative coherent (whip-edge gouge, amber vault), rhythm varies; minor scaffold in repeated "lifted the lantern."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)

    Figurative density overwrites climax ("tide of remorse, each syllable a drop") with muddled vehicles, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops on guilt/regret in sifting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Patterned "antique drawer pull" (5+ recurrences) and "furrowed hush" (3x) loops create churn dulling late propulsion; paraphrase in peace/weight lifts ("felt the weight lift/soften"); overwrought metaphors obscure peak box beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.5)
    Paraphrase loops on "regrets" (tidal wave, backlash, linger like thunder) and "faith" (flickering to steady ember) across beats dull propulsion; metaphor density overwrites without payoff in reflective peaks, e.g., "sorrow dissolve into light, stitching ragged edges."

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Figurative density like "cathedral of algae" and "phosphorescent world" overwrites most sentences in reflective beats, dulling propulsion; minor synonym loops on "glow/pulse" and "labyrinth" repeat without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm passing ear test, but minor overwrite from clustered metaphors ("filament of starlight," "cosmos contract") in peak ritual slightly dulls propulsion; no loops, clear syntax, purposeful poetic compression taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    High density with vivid propulsion, but overwriting in repeated "choking beauty" and stacked metaphors ("sang like wind-chimes," "velvet" air) muddle peak fissure beat; minor paraphrase loops in glade pulsing dull minor momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; sentences avoid loops. One mixed metaphor—“tomb to a breathing sanctuary”—is minor. Information density is high; each paragraph advances observation or pattern. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—short clauses during fire escape, elongated sentences under star chill. Occasional poetic stack (“glassy hush that seemed to breathe with the wind”) risks purple but stays character-true. Only minor scaffold: “she realized that…” repeats twice; not enough to dull closure. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each image advances atmosphere or stakes; no paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Metaphors stay coherent within the glass/warmth lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”) risks register drift, yet these terms appear outside the POV only in narrative compression, not in peak beats, so clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Information density high: single sentences carry place, tool, emotion (“water pressed…patient sigh”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphor vehicles consistent (glass eye, ribs, pulse). One mixed metaphor—“cracked like the memory of a storm”—but resolved by closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (“breathing dragon,” “lantern chest”) and serve inhale/exhale motif. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “silence reservoir”) slightly overshoots POV register, but never in the closure beat. Rhythm breathes with the scene; no scaffold or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence music is deliberate—long breathy clauses mimic vine-webs, then snap to short beats: “She whispered.” No loops or scaffold; every line adds sensory or causal layer. A few abstract nouns (“texture of time”) could be traded for concrete images, keeping it from full 9.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, cause, or atmosphere. Density is high—“cells divide in hidden hydroponic beds” compresses biology and time in five words. Metaphors stay coherent: forge/void/aurora share celestial fire imagery. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; even abstract verbs (“inhale”) remain embodied. Closure line is clean, sonic, and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm alternates between breath-long fragments and cascading clauses that mimic train-station echo, never looping into template cadence. Figurative density is high but each metaphor (moonbeams as liquid silver ribbons) pays off in the lantern ignition, avoiding purple excess. Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs—lantern as beacon, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates; nominalizations controlled. Metaphors stay coherent (ice as glass) but occasional stacked abstractions—“kaleidoscope of colors that seemed to laugh”—dampen immediacy. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Final third free of artifact; closing image crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density; most sentences dual-task (action + atmosphere). Metaphor strings (“rusted bones,” “second skin”) stay coherent under Accumulative lens; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “trembling certainty” repeated 3×; final instance charges closure so allowed. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. End-line propulsion strong; amber pulse / star-name inversion fresh. One homophone risk—“aisle” correct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is dense and loop-free; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes without synonym churn. Metaphors (“phantom serpent,” “river of stars”) stay coherent within the storm/sea logic; no mixed vehicles collide. Rhythm modulates—long sweeps for calm, staccato clauses for gusts—supporting momentum. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “hush” phrases could be merged, but the repetition is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, so penalty is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensor read, metaphor, and plot advancement. Rhythm breathes—long breathy clauses for twilight, staccato for droplet impacts. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional frost/crystal repetitions fall within pattern-taught allowance; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences multitask (“Through that lens she could read the faint phosphorescence…”). No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent. One mixed moment—“chorus of murmurs that felt like words after words become unnecessary”—is self-conscious but doesn’t obscure causality. Rhythm modulates with discovery beats, accelerating as projections bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic but template cadence repeats (“He… He… Each…” runs) without pattern-payoff, docking −0.4. Mixed metaphors (“blooming withering symphony”) coexist with precise moss-voice image. Density remains high; no scaffolding sentences. One paraphrase loop (“each polished marble would carry… each shine a salute”) noted. Closure line avoids artifact, keeping cap at bay.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exemplary: zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, high density—“the air turned to icy warmth, a paradoxical breath that seemed to both freeze and soothe the steel beams” does three jobs at once. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to staccato “She pulled.” Metaphors stay coherent within physics of station and never muddle causality. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like slow adagio; no template cadence or mixed metaphor. Information density is high—“vellum pages warped and stained” does triple descriptor duty. The single allowed figurative cluster (“amber light trembling like breath on wet wood”) is earned and pattern-central. No loops, no scaffold, no artifact in closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory detail, metaphor, and plot advancement—“ink bled, faint lines of humidity and pressure emerged, echoing the station’s own pulse.” Mixed-metaphor risk—“brittle leaf” vs. “feather caught in a gale”—but internal logic holds. Minor scaffold: “the weight she sought seemed to lift” repeats the lifting conceit. Otherwise crisp, concrete verbs; no synonym churn. Closure image unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene cadence. Figurative language is selective—“rusted artery,” “frozen syllables”—and never stacks in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“weight…weight…weight” across two adjacent sentences) knocks 0.2. No scaffolding, no template cadence, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high; each sentence advances setting, character, or concept.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense: “regenerative silence that healed even broken thoughts” layers metaphor and stakes in one stroke. No synonym loops; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (swan folds = chant syllables). Occasional elevated diction—“conceptual repricing” territory—slightly overshoots POV lexicon but never snags closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with sentence-length variation; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid but leans on soft intensifiers (“quiet that felt like the breath of the earth itself”) and stock dyads (“travelers, locals, children”). No loops or mixed metaphors, yet sentence rhythm can settle into lullaby repetition that cushions rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is dense and image-rich, yet figurative layering occasionally stacks three metaphors in four lines (“mirror,” “echo,” “flag of revelation”), diluting clarity. Several near-paraphrase pairs (“set free... ripple through the world, as familiar as the scent of sea salt”) create micro-loops. Momentum survives, but the final third’s lyric surfeit slightly dulls the closure image’s precision.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense but seldom clogged; clauses carry double duty (sound/ethics). A few metaphor stacks—“spiral of tonal prayer,” “cascade of silent colors”—risk purple, yet they occur at the climax where heightened diction is earned. No loops or synonym churn detected. Strong read-aloud rhythm; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet musical: information carries rhythm, syntax breathes with scene crescendo. Figurative language is patterned early (sound-through-glass) and paid off, avoiding purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory angle or causal tilt. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image without scaffolding. One strained metaphor—“membrane of vibrating chords”—slightly blurs physical logic, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    Metaphors are frequently stacked (“inverted roots,” “broken mirrors,” “dying star”) risking purple overload, yet stay legible. Paraphrase loops minor: “fractured timelines…periodically eternal” concepts reworded across adjacent sentences. Information density high; sentences multitask. Filter-verb clusters absent; pronoun reference clean. Final third carries figurative muddle (“darkening brightness reaching apex”) disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does description + causality (“When she turned the crank…afterglow”). No scaffold loops; metaphors consistent (sound=thread/ribbon). Occasional elevated phrasing—“jagged filament of hush”—justified by lyric mode taught early. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density—single sentences do triple duty: “Tonight…violet…humming” delivers time, color, and threat. No scaffold loops; each metaphor is single-use and precise. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mimic creeping dusk, shorter ones the metallic click of decision. One near-purple phrase (“vines like whispered secrets”) but it passes before any drag on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm modulates—long cadence for descent, staccato at forks, hush at final knot. Sentences carry dual duty (atmosphere + causality) e.g., “frayed coil…echoing the sighs.” One minor paraphrase loop: “texture of time” repeated without new charge at very end (−0.3). Otherwise zero redundancy; no mixed metaphor; spatial tracking flawless. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for lagoon hush, staccato sparks at fire. Some metaphor stacks verge on excess (“charcoal roots,” “skeletal guardians,” “tide seeking hidden shore”) but pattern is taught early and sustains mood. No scaffold loops; nouns specific, verbs strong. Closure line is clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and commercial data. Metaphors are consistent—amber, static, gold, dust—no mixed vehicles. One minor loop: “sealed the vial with a click, the amber glow sealing…” (seal/sealed) could be pruned. No artifacts in closure beat; propulsion carries to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language clusters in descriptive beats rather than high-pressure turns, so density does not obscure causality. Occasional hyphenated coinages (“secret tide,” “quiet shine”) read as intentional lyricism rather than thesaurus drift. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Opening and closing lines are image-driven and ear-tested, providing resonant bookends without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density: “each step cracking the dew-kissed stems as if the ground itself whispered” does three jobs in twelve words. A few soft spots: “webs of kinship” is repeated thrice in identical phrasing; “luminescent ache” risks coined-phrase fatigue. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final paragraph contains three sentences beginning “Together they” – minor template cadence but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: one sentence often layers metaphor, action, and world rule (“luminous ribbon unfurled… sketching a new hour”). Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“lattice of stone ribs”) so payoff at closure feels taught, not overwrought. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Minor scaffold: “the notion of a sleeping giant felt literal” could compress, but does not obscure causality. Closure image is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet mostly precise: “silver shadows,” “luminous petals” evoke without stacking mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“orchard’s quiet lull” / “orchard grew silent”—occurs early; otherwise redundancy is minimal. Sentence openers vary; droplet syntax stays monosyllabic to mimic drip. Final third avoids overwriting, letting petal-fall stand unadorned; this restraint prevents artifact bleed into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is spare yet textured; figurative language is rationed to three controlled bursts, never clogging the final beats. Sentence lengths vary to match stealth vs. reveal cadence, and no scaffold or synonym loops appear. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, cleanly bracketing the arc with minimal clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between luxuriant clause-strings for drizzle and clipped fragments for thunder. Metaphors stay botanic-electric (ozone, filament, conduit) without cross-contamination. Two paraphrase loops (“circuitously sincere” x2, “reluctant metamorphosis” x2) nudge toward template cadence but fall outside final third; no clarity lost. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propulsive, loop-free.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally clean, with strong nouns and varied rhythm, but figurative runs stack in climactic column—“rain trail seemed to converge…spiraling upward…like a lantern”—creating slight purple swirl that dulls immediacy. One paraphrase loop (“meaning she had long been threshing”) repeats concept within three lines. Closure image itself is sharp, so the −0.4 artifact penalty applies, not deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lush but loops: “overlapping shadows” repeated four times with near-synonym churn; “bright darkness” echoed obsessively. Metaphors sometimes mix—“tear of luminescent amber rolls into shadows turning them into ribbons of light”—yet retain dream logic. Scaffold present: “the cave responds,” “the cave becomes,” “the cave continues.” Information density moderate; imagery does triple duty. Read-aloud ear is hypnotic, but pattern risks monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear: cadence mirrors staggered dock echoes without template churn; metaphors stay maritime-consistent (glass → sponge → chord). Information density high—“lanterns flickered like fireflies, but the archivist kept his work” does three jobs in twelve words. Minor scaffold: “each new piece could shift the narrative of the whole” abstracts what we already see. No mixed metaphor, no artifact within final third; closure image remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative layering is dense but purposeful; only one mixed vehicle (“vault opened like a colossal eye” beside “walls inscribed with constellations”) momentarily blurs physical logic. No loops or scaffold; high information density carries reader down the staircase beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors are coherent—whale ribs entwine with heart—without mixed logic. Sentence variety accelerates during tile shifts, then lengthens into calm at closure. Only one near-purple clause—“silver arcs across the horizon”—but it is earned by prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet read-aloud musical; metaphors stay geologic and coherent. No synonym loops or scaffold. A single mixed vehicle—“heart of misplaced destiny” (organic/abstract)—slips through. Information load is high but justified by accumulative design. Final dust image is precise, not overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero scaffold, no synonym loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath; final line (“ink pot clinked softly”) recharges earlier object with after-cost. Figurative language sparse—only “midnight river,” “veins of gold”—each tied to ink’s physical behavior, avoiding purple. Syntax varies; no template cadence; read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythmic variation mirrors dawn’s gradual brightening; sentences lengthen then fragment as light scatters. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor extends optic/botanical schema, avoiding mixed-logic. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Information density high: single sentence often layers time-texture, tool, and motion. Proofing clean; only minor over-modification (“bruised violet sky”) but fits palette.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences layer time, scent, and metaphor (“sepia hue… museum of vanished moments”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“rusted bones” = containers). One mixed vehicle: “layers filter reality” is abstract, but immediately grounded by visual filter of label. Filter-verb clusters absent. Closure sentence—“texture of memory I could touch and share”—is crisp, propulsive, and artifact-free.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise flips the usual ghost-story: the living man is the ghost, the port is the haunted house. Poison-label-as-projector is a fresh optic device; erased histories made literal through tide-timed light show. Risky accumulative structure taught early and paid off. Specificity: timestamps on label match overheard snippets—an indexing system that feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: swap label for generic map and the climax collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—short beats at climax, longer coils during reflection. Metaphor chain (shell=key, cello=compass, dome=page) remains coherent because vehicles stay acoustic. Minor scaffold: “resonant hum” is repeated four times without new inflection; one instance could be cut. No mixed metaphor or register drift; closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. Information density high—“foundation stone chip, barely the size of a fingernail, embedded… resolved into a map”—three jobs in one clause. Metaphors stay coherent: “floating circus,” “tide of change.” Minor loop: “hopeful desperation” phrase echoed three times; doesn’t obscure closure but dulls nuance. No typographical errors or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence either advances the chemical countdown, textures the lunar surface, or sharpens the inspector’s inner calibration. Metaphors are spare and precise—visor “reflecting the thin silver glow”—never competing with the physics. No scaffold loops, no synonym churn, no register drift; the one audible alliteration (“breath of the world before sunrise”) is earned by thematic resonance. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final click, then exhales with the descending footsteps, mirroring heartbeat and exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines (“droplets catching the lantern light and scattering it like tiny prisms”) do double duty: sensory texture + thematic refraction. Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language peaks at closure without muddling causality. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from depot rumble to drone whisper, mirroring departure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: variation between sibilant wind lines and clipped toll beats. No loops or synonym churn; “cracked spine cracking” is deliberate sonic echo, not artifact. Information density high—one sentence often does map, body, and weather. Metaphors stay coherent (ice = silence, bell = herald) and do not tangle the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphor chains (“wild hush,” “lattice of silver”) recur purposefully, forming an accumulative pattern that pays off in the final hush. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated register (“consented to be rebuilt”) fits the mythic tone without jarring. Paragraph breaks mirror footfall beats, sustaining momentum; only minor scaffolding (“each imagined footfall” repeated) keeps this from the 9-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.0)
    High metaphor density sustained across mid-pressure beats; purple tinge (“tide of gathered hush…cradled her like a mother’s breath”) but pattern taught early. Several paraphrase loops—“hush” echoed four times in two sentences; “scent of eternity” restated as “perfume of hope.” No mixed metaphors or grammar slips; rhythm breathes with scene. Closure image clean, so −0.4 for accumulation only.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyric density is high but patterned; repetition of “copperlight repose” and “hush” is purposeful, taught by line 3 and paid off in final image. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “stone walls breathing salty wind” is single coherent vehicle. One paraphrase loop: “lattice from confessional” appears four times with identical noun phrase—minor, does not touch closure. Rhythm modulates naturally; no scaffolding sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: three-beat anaphora (“each…each…each”) escalates like a chant, then breaks into the spare final sentence. Only one scaffold loop—“resonant awakening” appears twice in adjacent lines—minor, non-closure touching. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene pauses; sentence openings vary; no loops or paraphrase clusters. Metaphors stay physically coherent (tide, yarn, frost veins). Occasional modifier stacks (“hauntingly optimistic lullaby,” “orchid veins in frost”) border purple but serve voice, so −0.2 only. Dense information per sentence; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but breathable; nouns and verbs carry weight (“snaked,” “glint,” “clicked”). No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (roots = rivers = clock gears) stays internally coherent. One mixed metaphor—“roots lifting like reverent hands” plus “marrow whispering hymns”—slightly overloads the beat but does not obscure causality. Opening and closing lines are muscular and image-driven, passing the read-aloud test.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene beats; sentence openings vary. Four adjacent sentences begin with “The” in the drone paragraph—minor template cadence (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; “pixelated seas” is precise. Information density high; no scaffold loops. Closure image clear.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no algorithmic cadence. Density high—single lines fuse sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“wind shifted … pattern that matched the rustle”). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay coherent. One paraphrase loop (“echoed silence … humming with promise”) costs −0.2. Otherwise clean of scaffold, filter verbs, or purple excess. Final ash line lands with crisp resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    High figurative density is patterned from first sentence; mixed metaphor risk (“living hymn,” “liquid glass”) is licensed by lyric mode. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Clarity intact at closure. One overripe line—“fierce tenderness rise within, a paradox of strength and gentle surrender”—triggers minor purple flag, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates from long mist-laden sentences to clipped “gentle click of her pen,” propelling attention. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs are minimal; “she felt” appears once and is earned. One paraphrase loop: “shared anxieties...shared anxieties” within 30 words; minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined: each sentence layers light or fog without synonym churn. Occasional soft abstracts—“luminous optimism,” “pensive mirth”—slip in, but metaphor vehicles stay coherent. No loops or template cadence; paragraph cuts are clean. The final line’s imperative whisper edges toward poetic overstatement, keeping it shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, with sentence length varying to mimic wave-build and release; metaphors stay mutually coherent (sound = ribbon = aurora). A faint template cadence—“each…each…each…”—appears mid-text but does not tangle causality or dull the closure. Minor scaffold: “tiny scenes of countless awakenings layered like sound” paraphrases the prior beat; −0.2 keeps it beneath 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence flexes with seed-crackle and spiral verbs; no loops. A few stacked modifiers (“kaleidoscope of fragrant, humming possibilities”) flirt with purple but serve the warp. High density; each line seeds image or sound. Minor figurative muddle keeps it sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm is deliberate and oceanic, but metaphor density approaches purple in stretches—“visual blossom armistice,” “galaxy postcard tucked inside a cracked sea-glass bottle”—slowing momentum. Mixed metaphors occasionally tangle: is the postcard a seed, a treaty, or pollen? Loops are minimal, yet scaffold phrases (“he began to,” “each echo a”) repeat. Information density is high when image stacks serve double duty (glow = joy = memory), but some sentences could lose 10% weight without loss. Closure line is clean, luminous, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet generally precise; occasional perfume—“bittersweet ache that made each breath taste of violet sorrow”—edges purple. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative chain sustained across entire piece without mixed metaphors. High density, but ornamental layer occasionally slows propulsion in mid-paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: one sentence often triple-loads sensorium, metaphor, and causal pivot (“the chain had been gifted with an encrypted compassion…waiting for the right mind to decode”). Rhythm breathes—no template cadence, no paraphrase loops. Figurative language stays coherent under physical logic; mixed-metaphor risk sidestepped by keeping vehicles inside geological/biological family. Clean copy, zero artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; scaffolding minimal. Information density high: one line can layer dust motion, map notation, and emotional import. Figurative language is controlled; only one mixed moment (“bloom with a withering grace”) but it is intentionally oxymoronic and thematic, so allowed. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift; clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is musical; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, clustered only in the mirror-song climax where it belongs. Information density high: “each step shedding the weight of loss like leaves” does three jobs—metaphor, motion, emotional cost. Zero scaffolding; each paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or charge.</question>
    
    <question>8</question>
    <grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Fusion of meteorological code + wooden grain-reading + butterfly-effect maze feels inevitable yet fresh; no template plot matches this synthesis. Risk—quiet lyric ending rather than set-piece escape—pays off via charged poise. Transformation test passed: swap names and the ritual collapses; specificity is the content. Familiar trope of lost child is re-cast through architectural mysticism where cartography becomes devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative layering is dense—every sentence carries metaphor—but pattern is consistent, not chaotic. Occasional scaffold (“softly ingenious” repeated) and abstract noun stacks (“luminous respite,” “shadowseam wonder”) create slight purple tint. No loops obscure causality; clarity holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Figurative layering is dense but purposeful: each metaphor (tide of recollection, cheerful gloom, rose-colored sigh) reappears at a higher register, building a coherent emotional spectrograph. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; the only scaffold is the repeated “seed-press-glow” beat, which is pattern, not padding.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers image, motion, and metaphor without scaffold. Figurative strings are dense but coherent—inked clouds, gull-notes—because they follow physical logic of water, light, sound. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; opening and closing lines act as brackets that recharge motifs. Micro clarity: pronouns, tense, sequence all clean; no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—image plus forward motion. Occasional soft repeats (“obsidian grace” twice) and near-synonym clusters (“pulse,” “cadence,” “rhythm”) slightly dull edge. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph avoids syntactic monotony, letting the last strand of dust linger. A trim of two adjectives per beat would sharpen high-tension lines.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet aerated—each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. Occasional soft repeats (“quiet testimonies…quiet galaxy”) are within lyric tolerance and pattern-taught. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final third is clean. A single paraphrase loop costs the 0.2 that keeps it under 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is mostly loop-free; occasional decorative stacking (“sea-foam draped stone columns…kaleidoscope of potential”) risks purple but stays within lyric pattern taught early. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“stitched equations into fabric”) propel. One paraphrase loop (“trial balloons…trial balloons”) mid-story; not fatal, but keeps 9+ band out of reach.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—each metaphor (ivy as green-threaded artery, negative as bridge) appears once and earns its keep. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory data, historical memory, and tool use. Only a single paraphrase loop (“walls dreamed… walls themselves were living histories”) costs a hairline slip, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high but patterned early (“coded lullabies,” “borrowed heartbeat”) and pays off at closure; mixed metaphors are rare. However, successive sentences often paraphrase the same shimmer (“softened the stone air,” “quiet pulse of the world,” “hush before bells”) creating micro-loops that stall propulsion; trimming one per trio would sharpen the crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is mostly varied; a few “the” openers cluster yet do not drum. Metaphors—sky as choreography, swords as storm—cohere within lyric treaty motif. One scaffold pair: “its darkness now a canvas for the silver light of reconciliation” restates the prior clipboard glow without fresh pressure. Information density strong; each sentence layers symbol atop sensory motion. Closure line free of clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence layers drought-engineering, map-reading, egg-casing, acoustic lore without scaffold. Rhythm breathes with beats—thunder lull = syntactic pause before wire-click. No paraphrase loops; “cracked” repeats only twice and gains new charge. Metaphors stay physically coherent (glass → salt sheet) and do not muddle closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Most sentences carry double duty—image plus motion, metaphor plus stakes—keeping density high without purple overload. A few metaphor stacks (“thousand tiny suns trapped within glass,” “sunrise trapped in ice”) skirt overwriting but arrive at high-pressure beats where extravagance is earned. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; pronoun and spatial references stay clean.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is sonically deliberate and mostly lean; sentence variety is good, but metaphor density is high—almost every sentence carries a figurative vehicle, creating minor purple haze. No loops or synonym churn, yet a few near-repeats (“half-lit epiphany” variants) dull the final beat. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif cleanly. Clarity never breaks, but compression could sharpen the ember-bright instant.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is rhythmically alive—varied sentence lengths mirror breath of stillness vs. wingbeat—but occasional modifier stacks (“fleeting amber veil that made the grotto blush with a rosy hush”) slightly dilute clarity. Metaphors stay coherent within lyric logic; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Minor paraphrase loops (“quiet hymn,” “quiet anthem”) keep it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyric density is high but patterned early—aurora, frost, copper—so it reads as taught texture rather than ornament overload. Mixed metaphors are rare; “snowmelt ardor” is abstract but single-use. Occasional template cadence (“each loop…each name…each syllable”) creates liturgical rhythm that serves theme, not monotony. No paraphrase loops; sentences advance. A few adjectival stacks (“brittle rectangle of paper with tiny perforations”) could trim, but none obscure causality or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence variety strong; openings rotate between participle, noun-phrase, and verb-led. One paraphrase loop: “paths choose their walkers… paths choose new walkers” recycles in adjacent clauses—minor. Metaphors stay coherent (vine/time, seal/mirror). No template cadence or synonym churn in peak beat. Final line lands cleanly. Density is high without purple overload; momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is scaffold-free; no loops, no synonym churn. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“bridge of light” extends the ledger metaphor without spillage. Information density high: one sentence often sets time, tool, and mythic weight (“between regimes...he aligned...”). Rhythm accelerates into the violet click, then exhales with the palace’s inhale—exact cadence match to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean and image-rich; high density without loops. Metaphors (“muted mural of shifting grace”) stay coherent and restrained, avoiding purple drift. Occasional elevated diction (“vaulted heart,” “cellular memory”) is justified by the mythic register; no mixed vehicles or paraphrase loops detected. Final line breathes cleanly, recharging the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense but patterned—“silvered glass,” “silver ribbon,” “silver glow”—teaching a metallic-fog motif that pays off in the mirror’s final hum. Zero paraphrase loops; each image adds new functional detail (sextant arm straightens, fog seals cracks). Strong verbs—“coaxing,” “welding,” “coiling”—propel without adverb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long cadences for leaf-whisper exposition, tighter fragments during needle-work. High info density—each sentence layers task, sensory filter, and metaphor without synonym loops. No mixed metaphors; cracked glass / cracked cathedral light stays coherent. Closing chime is sonic single-word payoff, not cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences breathe and contract with revelation pace; metaphor density peaks only at the mosaic pulse where it is earned. No paraphrase loops, but “luminous” and “starlight” recur enough to approach template cadence; the repetition serves the accumulative design so the artifact is light. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line resolves by image-action (“he turned, ready to write”) that recharges the orchard hum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, only one paraphrase loop (“unheard symphony” thrice in 60 words). Metaphors stay coherent (store as cathedral, fungi as chorus). No scaffold sentences or synonym churn. Density is high: each sentence layers image, action, concept. Minor register drift—“conceptual repricing,” “micro-setting”—is genre-apt, not jarring. Closing image is crisp; earlier clauses never cloud it.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    High figurative density almost every sentence; pattern is taught early (“mist clung,” “stitched feathers”) and justified by lyric mode, so −0.3 not −0.7. Mixed metaphors rare; “rusted chains of light” is coherent. One scaffold: “echoed with the sound of a distant carousel music” could compress to “distant carousel music echoed.” Closure line clean, so remains above 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “ticking gears” simultaneously world-build and foreshadow the stopped clock—keeping density high. Occasional velvet folds (“cascade of copper-glinting strands”) verge on ornamental, but they cluster in low-pressure beats; no mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and musical—“low, reverberating tones,” “hammered repose,” “bloom of hush”—yet each phrase advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; vehicles stay acoustic/ geological. Information often twin-loads: “dripping silence” is both sensory and causal (ice melting signals success). One near-purple phrase—“living auroras”—is acceptable under lyrical license. Closure line breathes cleanly without figurative muddle.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
    <comment>Premise fuses acoustics and archaeology: a mapkeeper who reads fracture-chords to locate a silence-stone is fresh. The inversion—energy beings soothed not by banishment but by calibrated quiet—reweights familiar “storm vs. sanctuary” trope. Specificity sells it: ripple-mark skin, sapphire tunnel, gold-veined charts. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure; it pays off when the final hush lands as felt vacuum. Not quite a 9 because the beings remain generic bright auroras without individuation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally vivid, but metaphor density clusters (“glass walls sing like thistle… ribbon of light unfurls… shard remembers”) create slight purple drag in the pivotal ignition beat. Paraphrase loops (“hope that refuses to be crushed… no wind can fully extinguish”) dilute momentum. Grammar clean, pronouns stable; scaffolding minimal but present.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet mostly propulsive; metaphor strings (“clouds peeled back…bruised violet”) are purposeful, not purple, and echo the color logic of memory-bruised sky. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Minor scaffolds: “He recorded…He recorded” within 40 words; a small paraphrase loop −0.2. Final third avoids clutter; closure image is clean, so high-band eligibility remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyric density occasionally tips into purple (“velvet blank that swallowed hope and sound alike”) but pattern is taught early and paid off at burst. No loops; each sentence adds tile or spark. One mixed metaphor (“note in mosaic” as both acoustic and visual) but does not obscure causality. Final line earns echo without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: each sentence layers image, motion, and metaphor without scaffold. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors; vehicles stay aquatic. Rhythm modulates—clause length mirrors tidal inhale/exhale. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line releases with salt-sprayed cadence. A single over-ripe adjective (“emerald wing dusted with ancient lacquer”) could be trimmed, but the beat is not dulled.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; most sentences carry double duty (image + interior shift). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed-metaphor watch: “molten gold” sun and “gilded hush” share semantic field, so coherence holds. One metaphor contradiction: “weightless and heavy” is deliberate paradox, not artifact. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers image-based resolution. Micro-registry drift noted above is the only line-level flaw touching a peak beat, holding it shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor extends the glass/wind/sound mesh—so coherence holds. One paraphrase loop: “silence grew” echoed by “vaulting hush” twice within forty words; minor, but it blunts climax. Otherwise high-density lines advance either image or beat; no scaffold redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is assured: varied sentence ingress, controlled paragraph breathing, zero template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative language is dense but coherent—veins of light, embers of memory—each vehicle obeys the sanctuary’s physics. No mixed metaphors; every image either advances atmosphere or constrains motion. High information density (a single sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work) with zero scaffolding or paraphrase loops—clean enough for immediate typesetting.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is vivid yet occasionally overwritten: three “glow” relatives in one sentence; “kaleidoscope that painted the farm in a shadowseam wonder” stacks two metaphors without payoff. Several filter-verb clusters (“I felt,” “I realized”) dull immediacy at peak beats, though not in the final line. No scaffold loops, but repetitive adjective-plus-noun cadence (“phantom glow,” “violet curtain,” “amber night”) leans toward template music. Information density is high; each paragraph advances image or concept, satisfying momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush yet controlled; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. Minor loop: “eloquently silent” is repeated four times—pattern taught but risks mannerism; no mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences; momentum holds until the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high but purposeful under accumulative design; mixed metaphors (“script unfurled like a living serpent breathing fire”) verge on excess yet serve the climactic reconfiguration. Occasional scaffold (“the night itself seemed…”) is minor; rhythm breathes with escalation. No loops or filter stacks; clarity intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no paraphrase loops, no template cadence. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“dust unfurling like a silent flag”). One mixed image: “weight…press the unseen narratives into sharper relief” is abstract without physical corollary. Density remains high; each sentence advances either atmosphere or discovery—no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm consciously musical, but figurative density in places (“silver veil,” “molten gold,” “phantom fireflies”) approaches purple threshold; one mixed metaphor—“starlight like scattered coins” then “lagoon… molten gold”—slightly blurs physical logic. No loops, no paraphrase, momentum clean.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but purposeful—mist as grammar, dew as lanterns—supporting the textural lens. One paraphrase loop (“in mist” x3) and occasional adjective stacks (“softly shimmering colors”) slightly dull momentum. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; only minor loop (“each leaf… each pattern… each seed”) and occasional stacked epithets dull momentum; metaphors stay coherent, and final beacon image is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; sentences advance at least two jobs (e.g., “tunnels…hummed with damp air and the distant roar” sets acoustics, humidity, scale). A few metaphor stacks verge on purple (“silvery sheets…ozone and old iron”) but stay legible and payoff-linked. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold detected. Opening and closing lines are crisp, anchoring voice and recharging motif respectively.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary from liquid longs to hammer shorts. Figurative density is high—“luminous regret,” “sunrise caught in a river of steel”—yet each image pays off by echoing the fused coin. One paraphrase loop: “weight of names” appears three times with minor rephrasing; trims −0.2. No scaffold; no mixed metaphors; pronouns clean. Final line lands with snap.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: stacked modifiers in glow descriptions accelerate toward brace moments, then short sentences mirror recovery breath. No synonym loops; “violet” recurs but each time reweighted by new sensory data. Metaphors stay coherent—light as scalpel, equation as heartbeat—without mixed vehicles. Final line’s color shift lands clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density; most sentences dual-purpose (e.g., “glass cold yet humming with a pulse… eternal instant captured”). Figurative logic stays coherent—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes: long accumulative clauses build to short release: “dissolve into the market’s night.” Scaffolding minimal; only two near-paraphrase echoes (“anchors… anchors…”) but do not touch closure. Clean proofing.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm alternates fluidly; clauses breathe during discovery then tighten during hatch pry. Figurative language is selective—“marquee flapped like a tired animal”—and stays coherent. Minor scaffold: two “faint” repetitions within three lines; not intrusive enough to dull closure. High informational density: each sentence layers setting, tool, and spectral cue without paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; no template cadence. Metaphors (glass orchard, bottled whisper) stay internally coherent and mutually reinforcing. High information density: one sentence often layers frost, ink, sound, and concept. A single mixed vehicle—“liquid darkness humming”—is permissible at lyric pitch. Line-level artifacts absent; closure image (“sunlight fractured across the lattice”) lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is compressed cathedral: every sentence refracts twin jobs—image and stakes—without scaffold. Metaphors (gilded relic, mirrored rain) stay internally coherent and physics-loyal. Zero filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“etched,” “stitch,” “reecho”) carry motion. The closing line’s “asteroid seemed to inhale” risks personification, but the breath is Lira’s, so the image holds.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet rhythmic; figurative chains (rust-garden, iron-vines) remain consistent with metallurgic logic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each sentence advances texture or action. Occasional elevated diction—“resonant pulse,” “conceptual repricing”—fits the mythic register taught early. The final lattice image is crisp, but “tinkersong wonder” recurs four times without new inflection, a minor cadence artifact that keeps the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Metaphor density is high yet coherent (petrified guardians, star-water) because each vehicle extends the central “resonant hush.” No mixed metaphors or contradictory physics beyond the untaught water-stair, accepted under lyric contract. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences in descent, then clipped fragments at crystal chime. Only minor scaffold: “the lagoon accepted her weight” → “the surface rippled outward” restate the same beat without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative density is high—storm-arch-throat, lantern-breath, rope-threads—yet pattern holds because metaphor family (sea, carving, breath) is taught early. A few paraphrase loops (“layered meanings” repeated; “turbine-hum reverie” thrice) mildly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors confuse spatial logic; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; information density is extreme—one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and carries texture: “zeppelin drifted above the endless desert, its brass hull humming like a distant prayer.” Metaphors are coherent: brass hum = prayer; dunes = echo cathedrals; crystal = spectrum paragraph—each vehicle obeys physical logic of sound/light. No filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice/stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “covenant” with new social contract between sand and sky.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lush but loops: “flickering thoughts… flickering… lanterns… lanterns” repeats within 50 words; “he imagined… he imagined… he imagined” creates template cadence mid-text. Metaphors stay coherent (lantern = memory spark) yet density approaches purple in the rebuild paragraph. No scaffolding or synonym churn at closure, so artifact does not touch the final image. Overall momentum breathes, but middle beat could lose 20 words without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: long breathless coils for spiral light, staccato for “cap vanished.” Figurative language is dense (≈70% of sentences) but patterned and paid off in final crystal-snowflake image. No mixed metaphors; frost-flame fusion stays physically consistent. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“resonant,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift, yet feels minted for this cathedral setting rather than thesaurus show.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, economical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“retired hymn”) are sparse and coherent. Information density high—each sensor datum advances stakes. Clause variety supports hush-to-crescendo arc. Minor elevated register (“solstice hush,” “conceptual repricing”) fits ceremonial tone without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and hypnotic; sentence variety supports the accumulative arc. Figurative language is patterned—star/death/light cycles—never crowding a single beat. No synonym churn or template cadence. One mixed metaphor (“polished by invisible hands”) is minor and does not touch closure. Information density is high; every clause advances texture or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is high: no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors, strong read-aloud rhythm. Information density is excellent—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and chronological data. Opening and closing lines are crisp; final amber tear sentence is flawless. Minor overindulgence in abstract nouns—“memory,” “promise,” “silence”—keeps it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening structure; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is selective (“liquid glass,” “sky stitched with constellations”) and never clusters in high-pressure beats. Information density is high—each garage-sale item does double duty as clue and emotional anchor. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive, and free of scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Metaphors are dense yet coherent: “salt air settle like a gentle sigh” keeps physical logic; no mixed vehicles. Clause-length modulates from long tidal sweep to abrupt kite-snap fragments, propelling beats. Minor scaffold: “woven dawns” is repeated 7×; the pattern is taught early and pays off in closure image, so loop penalty waived.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varies: long anaphoric “each…” sentences mimic coil rhythm, then fracture into shorter pulses as islanders feel pressure. Mixed metaphors are intentional—“petrified trees,” “conductive tendons”—and cohere within biomineralogic logic. No loops; every clause adds texture or knowledge. Density peaks when copper “humming” translates to “tree sighs,” marrying material science with animist lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or conceptual data. No loops, no scaffold, no filter stacks. Mixed-metaphor risk in “bronze quiet resonance” is paid off by rhythmic return. One near-purple line—“tower seemed to breathe as one organism”—is justified by the climactic synesthesia, keeping artifact control high.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from ceremonial rolling clauses to the staccato of pods unfurling. Metaphors (bleached bones, bruised violet) are spare and anchored in POV. No loops or scaffold; one near-repeat of “narrow vastness” is purposeful reprise, not churn. Final image is clean, luminous, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with sniff-paced sibilance and metallic percussion of rust-grooves; no template cadence. Figurative control keeps mixed metaphors coherent: "letters trembling like fireflies in a storm" blends light and sound without violating physical logic. Information density is high—each sentence layers history, color, scent. Minor scaffold: "vanished engines and empty promises" is abstract, but compression serves elegiac tone and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet textured; most sentences carry double duty (advance image + emotional valence). Figurative language is selective—no metaphor chains clog high-pressure beats. One scaffold trace: “stretched like taffy” borders cliché, but the confection image fits the sweet elongation motif and is isolated. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-driven economy; no loops, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each sentence advances image or tactic. Only minor loop—“each exchange felt like a prayer” echoes prior “silent amendment”—slows momentum. Metaphors stay coherent within ice/gear lexicon. Read-aloud rhythm propels toward the thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is textured but disciplined: “thin ribbons,” “benevolently ruthless,” “nomadic penumbra” offer fresh vehicles without stacking. One mixed metaphor—“luminous absence, a space where possibilities glow rather than darkened”—reads self-correcting and purposeful. Rhythm modulates: opening spondaic weight gives way to lighter footfall cadence during word-walks. Only minor scaffold: “small gestures” is repeated three times in closing paragraph; the echo is thematic but slightly redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose breathes: long sensory sentences coil, then snap to short clauses at the book-opening beat. No loops, no synonym churn; each detail either advances image or tightens pattern. Metaphors stay internally coherent (glass, mercury, thunder) and do not crowd high-pressure moment. Opening line anchors tone; final line returns to breath-melody, satisfying read-aloud cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled, with sentence variety that mirrors emotional ebb. Figurative layering is dense ("king’s strategy in a silent game") yet remains coherent. One scaffold tic: "the woven hush" is repeated four times with diminishing returns; trimming one instance would sharpen the music. Otherwise, high information density and zero grammar issues.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    High figurative density is justified by pattern-taught refractive motif; mixed metaphors (“wounded beast… bone towers… frozen finger”) cohere under optic/sonic refraction theme. Occasional scaffold near-duplicates (“refracted… refracting”) create micro-loop; not severe enough to dull the final image. Clause variation and sensory specificity keep propulsion alive.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but patterned; figurative chains (“tangle of gears-and-cogs…sky of bubbling acid…skeletal ship”) risk density overload yet serve the lyric mode. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory angle. Occasional elevated phrasing (“dire enchantment,” “golden seams”) flirts with register drift but stays consistent with alchemical idiom. Closure line is clean, crystallizing prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences often carry double duty (image + motion). One paraphrase loop (“each curve revealing a new echo… echo of distant waves”) is minor. No scaffold, no register drift; figurative logic stays coherent. Closure image is crisp, unpolluted by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: every sentence layers scent, sound, or light without paraphrase loops. Rhythm climbs with repetition of “pulse,” “whisper,” “vibration,” then exhales in the single-sentence final paragraph. Metaphors stay coherent (garden scent = tide; cork = heart valve) and physically trackable. Only hairline slip: “bright cascade of light spilled into the sea” edges toward purple, but the image is literalized by droplets humming, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies strategically; opening lyrical cascade gives way to leaner motion beats. No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors are dense (“broken cathedral of fruit”) but consistent with arboreal imagery and do not obtrude during climax. One mixed vehicle—“cathedral of fruit whose roots hung on sheer cliffs”—is forgiven for vividness. Scaffolding almost absent; each paragraph advances knowledge or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Metaphors (bruised lavender, brittle petals) are controlled—never more than one per high-pressure sentence. Information dense: one sentence often layers tide, emotion, and symbol. No scaffold; opening and closing lines are crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lush but leans on cumulative modifiers; several sentences perform the same atmospheric job, creating micro-loop drift (“creek rises / rising creek / rising louder”). No artifact touches closure, but density slows mid-story. Metaphors stay coherent; rhythm breathes with scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud cadence musical; however, 14 instances of “-ing” participles in 60-line mid-section create template sway that dulls propulsion. Mixed metaphors (“cascade of light that seemed to bleed”) are coherent within lyric pact but still mildly clutter. No typos; pronoun reference clean. Density high; each sentence advances image or motion.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lush but loops: “revalue,” “returning differently,” “density of presence” repeated without new inflection. Mixed metaphors—“spiraled into a dome of soft amber”—blur spatial logic. Template cadence in brush-dip beats dulls momentum. No artifacts touch closure; image remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Most sentences carry double duty (image + interior shift); occasional poetic overload (“feral nostalgia… jaded wonder”) slides toward template cadence but stops short of muddling causality. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffolding: “the letters rearrange themselves as if jealous…” could trim one qualifier, yet the figurative logic stays intact and the closure line stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.0)
    Figurative layering is dense—fog, breath, gear-oil, heartbeat—but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final silver line, so it avoids artifact penalties. Occasional paraphrase loops (“tremor of purpose… calm exterior… trembling calm”) create micro-scaffold, trimming immediacy, yet never obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (crystal shards as sung wind) advances atmosphere. One paraphrase loop: “breath between storms” repeated without new inflection; otherwise high density, zero scaffold, no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm modulates: long aromatic clauses build, then shorten into axe-fall cadence. Figurative density high but patterned early (induced currents metaphor taught), so avoids purple overwrite penalty. One minor scaffold: “metaphor…metaphor” restatement. Mixed logic in “induced currents pulsed…like prayer”—electric vs spiritual metaphor mash, but does not cloud closure. Strong final line anchors echo cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary and compress under count-pressure. Occasional lyrical stacks (“silver glass of water that seemed to hold its breath”) flirt with overwriting but serve atmospheric density. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Line-level artifacts do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.9)
    Metaphor density is high—almost every sentence carries a figurative pulse—yet pattern is taught early and paid off in final "soft click," so qualifies as purposeful texture. No mixed metaphors; all vehicles stay within farm/light vocabulary. One paraphrase loop: "quiet wildfire" appears three times with diminishing returns. Scaffolding minimal; prose propels through sensory specificity. Final image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Only minor scaffold: “the promise of new insight urged her onward” could be cut without loss. Metaphors stay consistent (books as veins, lantern as compass) and physically coherent. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates down tunnel then exhales at desk—sentence length modulation supports pressure without drumbeat repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is musical—varied cadence, strong verbs (“the concrete itself recognized a new cadence”)—but leans on ghostly/haunted modifiers in adjacent sentences, creating a faint echo loop. No scaffolding or paraphrase loops obscure causality. The final clause “promise etched into the very walls” is elegant yet slightly abstract; a tactile image would sharpen closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; metaphor vehicles stay coherent within maritime nocturne. One scaffold loop (“haunted euphoria” twice in four lines) and a single filter-verb cluster are minor artifacts. Otherwise clauses multi-task, rhythm breathes with scene tempo, and closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative language is selective—ivy “like a green curtain,” moon rock “like a captive star”—and paid off. No mixed metaphors or template cadence; “hacked together a contraption of old signal lights…” is dense, propulsive. One paraphrase loop spotted (“rumor that…rumor chains…”) but not in closure third; artifacts do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences perform double duty: “platinum compass ring that glowed faintly against her palm” anchors object, light source, and imminent cost in one clause. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends sonic logic—ring “resonates,” bark “crescendoed.” No register drift; diction stays within poetic fabula. Final line “horizon of her own becoming” risks abstraction but earns resonance by echoing “map of her soul” two beats earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned early—garden, tide, star-talk—so reads as taught rather than accidental. A few paraphrase loops (“strange comfort” repeated, “unbend” over-used) dull final third momentum. No contradictory vehicles; physics metaphors stay internally consistent. Strong paragraph cut test: each graf advances texture or knowledge. Overall propulsive but hairline surplus of shimmer adjectives keeps it under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrically dense yet propulsive; information dual-loads—each image carries sensory and symbolic weight. No scaffolding, loops, or mixed metaphors; “luminous harbor glittered on restless waves” is the single allowed ornament because it initiates the musical metaphor. Sentence rhythm mirrors tide: surge, crest, withdraw. Minor over-decoration in “joyful sorrow filled Arlen’s chest” is the only near-purple line, but it is anchored in paradox and does not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density—each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (“lava, bright and tender”) stay coherent and tied to fire motif. One paraphrase loop: “volcanic tenderness” is repeated without new charge in closing paragraph, a −0.2 scaffold hit that keeps the category sub-8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: most sentences perform double duty (sound + image, motion + theme). Occasional soft scaffold shows up—“each ripple sang a note of sorrow, auroral in hue”—where the appositive repeats the sorrow-aurora link already implicit, but the beat is brief and doesn’t recur in the closure third. Mixed-metaphor risk in “funeral veil” + “promise of renewal” is justified by the thematic tension. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym churn; punctuation and clause control stay precise, supporting the musical pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences advance at least two jobs (e.g., “storm’s electric tang” delivers sensory data plus stakes). One minor paraphrase loop—“glowing line… twisted… like a living vein” followed by “vein” again in next paragraph—costs a tick. No mixed metaphors or overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    High metaphor density in nearly every sentence; while pattern is taught early, it flirts with overwriting in peak beats (“cathedral” flash). Several near-paraphrase pairs (“silent empathy” / “hush that stretched like fog”) create synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, but sentence openings cluster around “The guardian / It / The water”. No mixed metaphors or tense slips; clarity stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is musical but density is uneven: three consecutive sentences start “It was…”; “quiet” is repeated eight times, diluting impact. Metaphors occasionally stack (“magnetic grotto under starlight… compass pulls iron… newborn rebellion”) risking purple hue. No paraphrase loops or tense slips, and opening/closing lines anchor the cadence effectively. Would benefit surgical trimming of echo words.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Syntactic variety propels: long tide-like sentences crash into fragments at crystal flare. No filter-verb clusters; “she felt” appears once, justified as tactile bone-pulse. Metaphors stay sea-true (“moon-struck daggers”) without mixed logic. Zero loops or scaffold; each descriptive line also advances choice (slipping boots → need for balance → readiness for flight).

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and imagistic yet avoids purple overload; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. One scaffold ripple: “carving a path for lightness” is echoed three clauses later—“carving light from sorrow”—but the variation rescues it. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final line earns its lift: “leaving the world a little less empty.”

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm is deliberate incantation, but cumulative figurative layering creates micro-muddle: “breath held in moonlight” atop “cloud-shadow poet” atop “watercolor of doubts” in first 100 words. Some paraphrase loops (“tremor of certainty” repeated thrice without deepening). Strong verbs (“carving,” “blur,” “weave”) and clean grammar keep propulsion. No artifact touches closure; final amber image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet selective; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“folded metal surfaces shimmering like a tongue ready to speak”) risk density but serve the reed’s animate logic and do not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density: “amber slipping into the mind’s void” packs sight, motion, metaphor in one clause. Occasional template cadence (“Each successive note questioned…”) but never in closure zone. No mixed metaphors; physical logic of light-to-sound holds. One paraphrase loop (“texture of connection” repeated) trims the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—information + atmosphere—without scaffold bloat. Metaphors stay coherent within light/astronomy register: lanterns as conjured stars, cranes as constellations. A few soft filters (“felt the faint promise,” “seemed to weep”) could be compressed to stronger verbs. No loops or synonym churn; final image lands clean, but earlier density of “genuinely artificial” refrains edges toward thesis-statement repetition rather than texture.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm is deliberate incantation; occasional stacked modifiers (“rain-beaded skylight loft glowed with a soft amber haze”) flirt with purple but serve the hush. No synonym loops; “rain-beaded skylight” is the only repeat, flagged above. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and mythic data. The final droplet image is crisp, no metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence; metaphor strings (“liquid memory,” “vortex of forgotten childhoods”) are dense but coherent under the lyric mode. A few near-paraphrase pairs occur (“steady yet unpredictably shifting light” vs. “steadily unpredictable”) yet do not obscure causality. Closure image is clear, allowing mid-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative density is high; stacked abstract metaphors (“library’s ribs of a great wing,” “moonlight-cold promise”) create atmospheric haze that slows propulsion. No scaffold loops, but near-paraphrase clusters (“shadow unbound” repeated with minor adjective shifts) dull urgency. Final paragraph blooms into sunrise without syntactic let-up, obscuring the thin causal chain. Read-aloud rhythm is musical yet information-poor; many sentences perform atmosphere rather than advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold: “layers of mistrust… layers of deception” restates without new pressure. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final third avoids artifacts, allowing high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences multi-task: “sand fell like soft snow, each grain marking a moment that slipped away unnoticed” advances image, theme, and stakes simultaneously. No paraphrase loops; each descriptor adds new angle (frosted—>clouded—>cleared). Metaphors disciplined to meteor & glass families, avoiding mixed vehicles. Only minor scaffold: “its glass clouded as if winter itself had been trapped inside” could compress, but doesn’t stall beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with staircase descent, accelerating at alignment climax.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Almost every sentence layers image, sound, and motion; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are audacious yet internally coherent (“river of memory” follows naturally from melted celluloid). A few stacked modifiers (“slow snow of forgotten reels”) flirt with purple, but they occur early in a low-pressure zone and establish tonal contract. Closure beat is clean, unpolluted by artifice, sustaining high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary length and opening; metaphor density high but patterned (stardust ↔ melody) and taught early, so earns its lyric weight. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “unspoken words” recurs with purpose. One mixed metaphor hiccup—“darkness scented with hope”—slight muddle under peak pressure, preventing 8+. Otherwise clean grammar, strong verbs, information-rich lines doing double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from long incantatory sentences to clipped fragments (“He lifted the chess clock”) that mirror the first tick. Metaphors stay physically coherent—sand petals, clock heart—and propel rather than stall. Minor template echoes (“the guard whispered… the dunes responded”) are too brief to obscure the luminous closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: clause-layered sentences swell then ebb, matching mist-rolls. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“dreaming clouds,” “heartbeat lighthouse”—so it reads as texture, not purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn detected; each image advances mood or motif. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual re-pricing”) sits slightly above Mira’s fisher lexicon, a hairline slip that keeps 9 at bay.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long frost-drifts and short pulses. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal weight. Minor template cadence in triple adjective clusters (“slow, deliberate flakes”) but does not stall closure. Metaphors stay internally coherent; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    High figurative density but patterned: “stone and dust,” “slow tide,” “graceful collapse” echo and repay at closure. No synonym loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with collapse tempo. Strong verbs, sensory nouns, minimal filters. Final line “ancient stones sang a low hymn” clinches aural echo cleanly. Micro-flaw: occasional stacked modifiers (“regally unpretentious crown of faded glyphs”) but not obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and double-tasking: “drifting moored, a calm sway that kept them anchored while thoughts floated like kelp” marries image to psychological state. Metaphors stay marine-coherent; no mixed vehicles. One loop near-miss: “periodically eternal” is repeated thrice—because it is a motif, the pattern justifies itself. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating circular ear-music without algorithmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: each sentence layers metaphor *and* propels (“glyph pulsed, matching the rhythm...”). Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are coherent—hum as rain on quiet lake—rather than contradictory. Opening and final lines act as bookends: margin of daylight → first true sunrise, satisfying paragraph cut test. Minor purple moments (“rusted cathedral,” “key forged from starlight and steel”) but they serve the lyric register and do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density high but patterned—steam, mineral, botanical motifs—taught early and iterated, so permitted. Paraphrase loops minor: ‘reconstruction… rebuilt… rebuilt tradition’ cluster near end (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; sentence rhythm varied. Information density good; lines multitask scenery + emotion. Final image clean; artifact friction slight, holds story under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense but not overcrowded; most sentences carry dual duty (e.g., “The gardens were a tapestry…” anchors setting + metaphor). Two adjacent “wind” sentences near midpoint verge on paraphrase but diverge in function; minor loop, not closure-touched. Mixed-metaphor risk (“map of loss and hope”) is brief and contextually grounded. Final paragraph varies cadence effectively, closing on an image that recharges “pearl” without textual clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening sibilance mirrors sea-spray. Metaphors stay coherent (cards as loose threads, lighthouse breathing) and payoff in closure image. No loops or synonym churn; “luminescent ache” recurs with reweighted meaning, not repetition for filler. Strong verbs—“slipped,”“sealed,”“whispered”—propel without adverb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence variety is strong; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Figurative density is high but patterned (ink = memory), so tolerable. One scaffold loop: “patterns…patterns” across two adjacent clauses. No mixed metaphors; clarity intact at closure. Temporal sequence clean; no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, with high information density—each sentence layers image, stakes, and metaphor without scaffolding. Occasional lyrical stacking (“letter’s ink…bled through the snow-white walls”) risks purple but stays purposeful under the accumulative lens. No loops or paraphrase beats; spatial and temporal sequence stay clear. A few adjectival strings (“ice-bound council,” “cryogenic coil”) flirt with register drift but do not obscure causality or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; sentences avoid template churn. Metaphors occasionally layer three-deep (“wounded bird” spiraling into constellations) but do not obscure closure. Information density high; most lines twin atmosphere + motion. Minor paraphrase loops (“hum,” “sing,” “echo” synonyms) dampen peak intensity −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence variety strong. However, metaphor density reaches nearly every sentence in the climax block (“floating thought,” “ink…rain,” “orbits of regret”) without pattern payoff, triggering −0.5. Occasional scaffold phrases (“a method that turned assumptions inside out until only truth remained”) summarize what the action already shows. No typos or pronoun drift, but the lyric overlay occasionally obscures precise causality; still, closure image is clear, so cap sits mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Varied sentence openings and lengths create acoustic ebb and flow; no template cadence detected. Metaphors stay sonic-consistent, no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers beetle, recorder, and emotional register. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; only minor adjectival lushness (“meteor hush tone”) but justified by textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive: “tile hummed a low vowel,” “lilac unease dissolve into curiosity.” Figurative layering is dense but patterned—each metaphor circles breath/silence—so density penalty waived. One paraphrase loop detected: “emergent hush” repeated three times within eight lines without new pressure; minor scaffold. Otherwise clean syntax, strong verbs, no mixed metaphors; final line lands with sonic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Occasional elevated latinate clusters (“retrocognitively trapped,” “conceptual repricing”) risk register drift, but the diction remains internally consistent with the mythic tone. Final line lands with crystalline concision that recharges every prior motif.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is thickly figurative yet never loops; each metaphor advances atmosphere or stakes. No synonym churn or template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors are intentional (“rusted brass and liquid violet”) and coherent within synesthetic rule-set. Minor scaffold: “the orchard answered” anthropomorphizes without set-up, but the figural slip is brief and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Density high—“fractally precise intervals,” “somatic markers as conduit”—but figurative load is patterned early and pays off. One scaffold loop: “light…light…light” triplet within 40 words, but it echoes LED strobe, so functional. No mixed metaphor; “willowglass” recurs with consistent glass-light semantics. Pronouns clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates from cavernous clauses to short pulse beats at lantern merger. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Occasional loftiness (“factually mystical”) is the lone register drift, but it is early, flagged, and absorbed. No loops, scaffold, or filler; every sentence advances image or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: single sentences fuse sensorium + action (“amber walls breathed slow glow”). One paraphrase loop—“the truth unravels” twice—costs −0.2; no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs throughout—“jar sang,” “cliffs listened”—avoid nominalization bloat. Final line achieves charged poise without explanatory tag.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong rhythmic control and sensory density, but frequent abstract qualifiers (“simple yet profound,” “quiet resolve”) create scaffold that softens impact. Mixed metaphors (“zephyr bluff…silver hush…breathing crags”) are coherent within lyric mode yet verge on stacked figurative excess in already dense paragraphs, trimming clarity. No paraphrase loops or syntactic templating; however, nominalizations (“renewal,” “redemption”) occasionally substitute for concrete verb-driven action. Overall read-aloud flow is musical; minor tightening would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric density flirts with purple, but metaphors stay coherent: river = manuscript, fog = spindrift, needle = stylus. No mixed vehicles; no template cadence runs. Occasional scaffold: “quiet serenity that seemed to percolate…percolate into the mist”—near-paraphrase loop clipped –0.2. Sentence variety excellent; paragraph cuts tidy. Final line earns its propulsion. Within high band, but metaphor crowding keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—long cadenced sentences for heat-haze, staccato clauses at hive awakening. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “sun rose like a careful sigh” sets tonal aperture; no mixed metaphors thereafter. Information density high: one sentence often performs sensory anchor + causal link + thematic overtone. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances lantern-position or timeline fracture. Clean copy; no grammar artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm is tidal—long rolling sentences break against single-beat fragments (“The latch clicked”). Figurative language is dense yet coherent; vehicles stay maritime (moon as ribbon, vines as oars). Micro-loop spotted: “quivering hush” appears three times in closing paragraph—minor because it accrues mantra power rather than clutter. No scaffold, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors; closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    High figurative density in every sentence risks purple overload, yet the maritime-light motif sustains internal logic; mixed-metaphor count is zero. One scaffold loop detected—“the hum of an ancient stone circle” repeated with near-paraphrase twice in mid-text—subtracts propulsion. Opening and closing lines are sharp; middle paragraphs rely on cumulative anaphora (“The library… The clouds…”) that can feel templated. Overall, ear-test passes; information is layered, but trimming 5% synonym shimmer would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is thickly figurative but patterned early (“prismatic quiet” repeated) so density reads as deliberate texture, not clutter. No mixed metaphors; water-to-star continuity is coherent. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and plot work (“The light traced the invisible thread…”). Minor scaffold: “gentle” occurs three times in 100 words, but rhythm never stalls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses, but paraphrase loops recur (“cautiously hopeful” x4, “power plays” x3). Minor scaffold: “the same frequencies could be weaponized…those who thrived on chaos” restates threat. No mixed metaphors; images stay electromagnetic. Information density high; paragraphs advance stakes or texture. No artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses metaphor, kinesthetic motion, and world rule (“the architecture staging its own quiet rebellion”). Figurative logic stays coherent—compass/constellation/organ form one celestial-mechanical lexicon. No filter-verb stacks or loops; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “the explorer” openings in paragraph 6; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is textured but disciplined: each sentence either advances the canvas or the quarry’s breathing. One paraphrase loop (“stone…stone…stone” in adjacent clauses) and a soft near-churn of “echo”/“hush”/“whisper” slightly dull the ear. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud rhythmic with no closure-touching artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors across 700 words—and each serves pressure (“rain hammered the tin roof like a thousand muted drums”). One scaffold: “nervous confidence” is repeated label-like. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density high; each paragraph advances stakes or image. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates from short dusk clauses to long sunrise sentences, supporting breath of climb. Few near-loops (“luminous disbelief” 2×, “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” 2×) but they land at emotional crests, not hidden. Metaphors stay internally coherent (echo, flutter, pixel); no mixed vehicles. Information density high; each paragraph advances exposure or map knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: single sentences often do double duty (“the office…resonated with a dusky harmony that matched his own calm”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay consistent (lantern, twilight, arena). One mixed image—“gunfire dissolve into dust”—is fleeting. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that re-charges markers. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Minor: four “dusky” repeats; else variety is natural.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—e.g., “the daylily-pressed telegram…curling like a sigh” delivers scent, object, mood, metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each repetition (shared burdens, variable stars) accrues new semantic layer. Metaphors stay coherent within astral/flowery field. One micro-slip: “the night grew softer” is cliché, but it does not touch closure beat. Rhythm breathes with Mara’s heartbeat, satisfying read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for dusk shimmer, staccato pulses at portal threshold. Information density is high; one line can layer color, scent, and myth. Minor scaffold: “anxious elation” is reused twice; the second could be cut. No mixed metaphor; moon-metal and violet light coexist within dream logic. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “root shivered, and a faint luminescence rose”—propelling while texturing. Metaphors stay internally consistent: veins/ink/threads all serve the same vascular logic. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sigil, root, and bone variant adds new visual data. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without mechanical symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is textured yet propulsive: “iron-kissed leaves humming with static that bent the very light” does triple sensory work in one breath. No synonym loops; each metallic image returns with altered charge (dust → snow → bridge). Figurative language thins at climax—final paragraph trusts plain image of blossom drinking bark, letting metaphor cede to wonder. One micro-scaffold: “she whispered the ancient tablet verses, each glyph mapped to a pulse” could lose “ancient” without loss; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density is high—each image carries moon/sea/gear triple duty. Occasional template cadence (“the librarian… the librarian…”) and abstract labels (“wonder in routine”) dull immediacy but do not obscure causality or closure. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops in peak beats; artifacts stay below closure-touch threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but patterned; occasional modifier stacks—“soft, trembling gleam,” “golden cascade”—risk purple yet stay legible because they serve the accretive color logic. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence adds chromatic or tactile increment. Rhythm modulates: longer breathless clauses for ascent, short beats for shell opening. Closure line is clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies between long tidal sentences and staccato map references. No scaffold loops; information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and cartographic work. One strained metaphor: “sky bruised with dusk” is minor. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with the scene: long, luminous clauses for discovery, staccato noun phrases for glyphs. Information density is high—each sentence does two jobs (atmosphere + decoding progress). No scaffold loops; “cyclically reversed” returns with purpose, not paraphrase. One near-mixed metaphor—“mist wrap around us like a veil”—but the physical logic holds. Final line cadence matches the watch’s chime, sealing the sonic motif.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence lengths and openings modulate without algorithmic drumbeat. Figurative language is dense but patterned (ice, lattice, perforation) and paid off at ceiling-crack climax—no coherence break. No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; props track cleanly. Highest pressure beat (“She chose to propagate the vines' dissent…”) keeps syntax tight and information multi-layered. A single mixed metaphor—“mulberry ache…flavored every decision like bitter fruit”—is vivid enough to pass.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but coherent—vehicles (flower seeking dawn, silent lake) stay within auroral lexicon. One paraphrase loop: “radiant hush” echoed as “luminous hush” in adjacent clauses. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density high; each sentence advances atmosphere or action.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence fronts; information density high—one sentence often carries sensory, symbolic, and plot work. Two scaffold traces: “quiet breath echoed...hush” and “scalloping with a rhythm” repeat stem concept unnecessarily; neither touches closure. Mixed metaphors (“heart scalloping”) momentarily jar but resolve. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacking; peak beat keeps figurative language spare and luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density, lyrical yet propulsive; occasional alliterative cadence (“breath of the sea and the sigh of the stone”) is patterned and thematic, not scaffold; no loops, no mixed metaphors, no clarity loss at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and musical; figuratives are disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Rhythmic variety supports trance momentum; paragraph cuts are clean. Only minor loop risk: “sycamore hush” repeated thrice could feel incantatory or redundant, but each reprise shifts context (dawn, chamber, final image), so it accrues rather than loops. No filter-verb stacks; no artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new layer (echo, glow, lattice). Figurative language is patterned and taught—“ancient ribs,” “living compass”—paid off when towers “breathe a sigh of relief.” No mixed metaphors; stone/bird/echo logic stays coherent. Information density high: one sentence often couples sensory detail with mythic register (“channeling the endless echoes that had layered themselves through centuries of dust”).

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent—long sentences for climb, fragment-like pulses at keystone touch. Information density is high; most lines do setting + interiority + metaphor in one stroke. Two micro-loops: “accommodates impossibilities” appears twice in close proximity; “lingering luminance” thrice. Mixed metaphor risk at “garden folly keystone… humming” is absorbed by fairy-tale register. No artifact touches the closure beat; momentum stays airborne.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence is deliberate and oceanic, but metaphor density approaches purple in places (“river of stars,” “sleeping leviathan”) without pattern-teaching justification. Two near-paraphrases: “promise that rose with the wind” + “lanterns drifted higher” within 30 words (−0.2). Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“slipped,” “sang,” “wrapped”) drive propulsion. No scaffolding, no synonym loops in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly. Minor figurative muddle keeps out of 8.8+ zone.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pressure: long clauses for meditation, staccato fragments for pops. High information density—each sentence does two jobs (world + emotion). Zero loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (coins = memory, amber = preserved sun). Only hairline slip: “rebellion against the inevitable darkness” edges toward abstraction, but saved by next concrete beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless clauses for aurora ascent, clipped fragments for naming beats. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative chain (crystal→droplet→aurora) stays coherent, physics intact. One mixed metaphor minor: “second heart” for monster pulse, but does not blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances drip, bell, or emotional cadence. Metaphors (“frozen river of light,” “shards of sky”) remain coherent within the water-light-sound axis. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is tactile—“he recorded each patter with a slender reed.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the droplet pulse, accelerating into the single-word ring that ends the valley’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, high density: “lantern a promise,” “hush settle like mirrored glass.” No loops or mixed metaphors; only a single template cadence in “the town… began to stir” is minor. Opening and final lines frame with image payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, sentence openings varied; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (phosphorescent snow, heartbeat flame) pays off in the final spiral. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional shift, and world rule. Copy-clean; no mixed metaphors or coherence breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Figurative density is high but patterned early (“cathedral of leaves”) and paid off in the closing confetti, avoiding clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, muscle motion, or stakes. Occasional elevated flourish (“soundless echo”) risks purple yet stays in-character. Rhythm breathes with climb-descent trajectory, propelling to buckle-bite close.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, with strong verbs and varied sentence rhythm; only minor paraphrase loops (“slice through pretense” repeated). Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. One filter-verb cluster around “felt a surge,” but it clears quickly. Clean copy, high density, momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong opening cadence; mid-section thins into template cadence—“each puzzle a promise,” “each tale a river,” etc.—slight loop penalty. No mixed metaphors at climax; final bloom image is clean. Density high; scaffolding minimal except for repeated anaphora.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long fugue sentences swell, then fracture at cord-click. Metaphors stay coherent—leaf-blower as baton, sound as surgeon’s blade—without mixed logic. No synonym loops; “mournfully eager” recurs twice but reweights at closure. Information density high: one sentence = blower-breath + ash motes + joke-embers. Only micro-slip: “vanish into shadows” is slightly generic; does not dull final image clarity. Well within elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density without scaffold: every sentence layers image + action + interior (“pendant seemed to hum a promise, a pact of uncertainty”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (frost, light, pages). Rhythm varies—fronted participles, em-dashes, paragraph breaths. Peak beat (“uncertainty it had long avoided now shimmering as a possible companion”) is clear, uncluttered. Minor elevated diction (“dimensionally homesick,” “conceptual repricing”) fits lyric mode; no clarity break. Proofing clean; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long accumulative clauses (elixir ingredients) to staccato pulses (“Nothing sparked, but…”) mirroring trial-and-error tension. Figurative density is high yet coherent—ember, hearth, bloom, phoenix form a closed metaphor set taught in paragraph 1. No mixed vehicles; cold flame logic is sustained without contradiction. Minor scaffold: “the penny dropped” repeated four times, but pattern is purposeful metronome, not artifact. Closure image is crystalline, no overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, technical, and emotional data. Mixed metaphors avoided—harp/city, comet/stairwell, lantern/moon stay coherent. One minor loop: “serenely electric glow” repeated near opening and close; distance blunts echo. Otherwise rhythm breathes with escalation, no filler, no filter stacks, clean grammar; closure line (“Genesis in Echo”) is crisp kicker.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies from hymnal parallelism to tight maritime beats; information density is high—each sentence layers image, stakes, and world-rule. However, figurative language stacks in nearly every sentence of the climax (“silver coin,” “phosphorescent threads,” “vein of water”) without pattern-teaching differentiation, triggering −0.6. Occasional scaffold near-duplicates (“the ferry vanished… the ferry never vanished again”) dull momentum. No grammar or pronoun drift; spatial tracking clean.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay internally coherent—liquid glass, fractal arches, golden rain—all obey optical logic. High density: “sinew thread, thin as a whispered promise” does double work (tactile + auditory scale). No artifact in final third; closure image is clean, uncluttered, luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Metaphor density high but patterned early; mixed metaphor risk in “sky whispered through stone” yet pays off in closure resonance. Some scaffold phrases—“faint tremor rose,” “pulse beckoned me”—repeat stems; minor loop artifact. Information density strong; sentences layer sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Final image crisp; no artifact touches closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and varied—“hulking mouth that swallowed daylight” does double atmospheric work. Only scattered filter verbs (“she felt”) and one mixed metaphor crash (“phase fields shimmered… concrete walls translucent”); clarity endures. No loops or template cadence; paragraphs advance knowledge or charge. Rhythm modulates with tide pulse, supporting momentum without overwrite in peak beat. Final sentence lands clean, echoing “crashing hush” opener.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; sentence length and paragraphing breathe with scene temperature. Metaphors are sustained—ink as star-field, shard as tuning fork—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold pair: “ink…ink” in adjacent clauses, but it advances image. No loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks; clarity preserved under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds pressure or texture. Metaphors are coherent—bone towers as ribs, diamond as shell—without mixed logic. High information density: one sentence often fuses setting, stakes, and sensory gear (“He whispered to the flawed diamond, inviting it to listen, to drink the invisible song of the birds”). Read-aloud rhythm modulates from cavernous long vowels to staccato chimes; paragraph cuts land on cadence shifts. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts propel descent then ascent. Information density high—single sentences do setting, object, mood. One paraphrase loop: “gravitationally playful” echoed twice without new charge; minor. No mixed metaphors; syntax stays within lyric narrator’s lexicon. Final line cadence mirrors garden sealing, earning momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    High information density; most sentences dual-task image + motion. Figurative layering stays purposeful, but three consecutive sentences beginning “The violinist...” and a near-paraphrase loop (“each beat into a subtle vibration... each stroke resonantly soft”) dull momentum mid-scene; artifacts never reach closure, permitting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with motion or object, avoiding template cadence. High density: “the roiling clouds sealed by glass and a whispered promise” does triple duty. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to listen”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. Final line lands with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear is impeccable: cadence mirrors wind-bell chiming, no template drums. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor extends the acoustic warp (train sighs, gears pray, fog veils). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence adds new sensory layer or causal push. Minor slip: “misting hush inside the chime of wind bells” teeters on tautology, but pays off at closure when the tautology becomes the symphony’s engine.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies, but occasional stacked modifiers (“quiet rustle of vellum and electronic sighs”) and conceptual loops (“stories truly reside… where stories truly lived”) create micro-scaffold. No mixed metaphors in the climactic projection, yet earlier “lattice of verses and equations” is repeated almost verbatim, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative layering is dense but serves image-accumulation; only one mixed metaphor (“tide spilling into a hidden cove” beside “glass of her camera”) momentarily blurs physical logic. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. High information density: each sentence layers light, memory, tool, and emotional charge. Closure image is crisp, undiluted by scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Metaphor density is high—almost every sentence—but the cosmic tenor is taught early and held, so −0.3 not −0.7. Mixed metaphors (“tapestry woven from forgotten dreams”) risk purple yet stay within dream-logic. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openers vary. Momentum breathes with long phrasal units; filament release line is clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences advance image or mythic pulse. Occasional lyrical surplus (“the sea that had both taken and given back stories”) but never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Information density high; each paragraph adds sensory or mythic layer. Closing line crisp, salted, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is dense but purposeful, never clogging the high-stakes noon beat; only minor scaffold—“the combative tenderness of the moment” is repeated within four lines—stopping short of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence variety carries the incantatory lift without drumbeat. Occasional modifier stacks (“hues of sunrise and midnight”) verge on purple but stay within lyric contract. No loops or scaffold; each image adds new sensory angle. One mixed moment—“seed answered by scattering”—risks anthropomorphic cliché, yet fits the taught magic. Closure line is clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; metaphoric layering (“dark river,” “muted hymn”) advances atmosphere without clutter; occasional adjectival stacks (“cascade of muted colors”) slightly dilute peak beats; no loops, no scaffold, grammar clean; final sentence achieves earned hush.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, creating rain-like cadence without algorithmic repetition. Metaphors (“stone echo,” “bruised purple sky”) stay coherent and local to the henge/vault world. No loops or synonym churn; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Minor scaffold: “the rain outside drummed…each tap a reminder” could trim, but it occurs early and does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and musical, doing triple duty: atmosphere, physics, emotion. Only hairline slippage: two adjacent “he thought / he realized” sentences could be fused, and “physics of letting go” edges toward template phrase. Otherwise no mixed metaphors, loops, or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally with the filament releases.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud cadence varies: long breath-lines for mist, clipped fragments for thunder cracks. Metaphors (“sky pulsed like a living circuit”) stay consistent to the code/flower fusion. One scaffold loop—“the graffiti sang...a tinkersong of electric hues” slightly repeats prior sense—keeps it from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled, sentences vary, no scaffold loops. Figurative language is dense (“sun trapped inside the stone”) yet patterned—light imagery taught early and paid off. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge the motif. Minor near-repetition of “scattered light” but it functions as refrain, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    High figurative density but patterned: starlight=ash, telescope=ledger, void=fabric—each recurrence re-weights meaning, earns its place. Zero loops, no filler; sentences carry double duty (image + emotional notation). Occasional elevated diction (“reverence on the foot”) fits ceremonial stance. Closure line clean, cadence slows to lullaby, no artifact interference.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is disciplined: no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse but exact—“sunrise trapped in timber”—and never obscures causality. Information density high: one sentence often fuses pigment recipe, emotional stakes, and time pressure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are clean, each advancing knowledge or image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry double duty—e.g., “starling murmurations…like living constellations” layers metaphor without stalling motion. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (sky-light / bird / copper circuit). One mild purple puff—“amber breath” of lantern—does not obscure causality. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for drift, staccato as chalk snaps to final square, supporting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive: “filament of light that curled like a whisper around his wrist” compresses image and action in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; metaphor logic stays internally consistent (light = key = whisper). Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. One near-purple phrase (“heartbeat steadied”) is forgiven because it lands inside the closure beat where emotional inflation is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is near-loop-free; only tiny echo “soft/softly” in adjacent clauses. Metaphors stay physical (vapor inhales sighs) and coherent. High density: one sentence often does description, mythic overtone, and causal push. Final line avoids scaffold, ending on listening arches—image carries reverb. Artifact-free in closure third: 9+ eligible.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Metaphors are internally coherent—“lighthouse rose like a scarred thumb,” “pane of hush”—and do not contradict physical logic. Information density is high: single sentences layer sensory, symbolic, and causal work. One minor purple patch: “quiet river of silver light spilled” risks prettiness, but it is immediately grounded by floor-level tactile spill, so momentum recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with stakes—long sentence for orchard sigh, fragment at nut-glow. High density: “ash on my tongue” does sensory triple-duty. One mixed metaphor “dragon” for frost is minor. No loops or filter stacks; closure image clear. Achieves 9-territory control save for single figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: foam-pop staccato under high-pressure beat, then longer cadence at twilight glow. No scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphor chain (DNA-ravine, foam-lattice, bridge-conduit) is coherent, not mixed. Information density high—“she wove the polymer solution through the reeds, allowing the natural flow to pull it into the gaps” does world, action, and metaphor in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet transparent; sentences carry dual duty (description + metric advance: “each leaf-book aligning by quantifying the absence”). Mixed metaphors are rare and functional (“liquid glow fracturing into shards” keeps within light logic). One minor scaffold: “the vendor smiled, feeling the weight of his quest dissolve” recaps what the image already shows. Otherwise clean, read-aloud rhythm, no loops or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence length varies, no template cadence runs. Metaphors are consistent (tide, kitchen spice, geological fracture) and mutually coherent, avoiding mixed-vehicle muddle. Occasional near-loop: “stone… stone… storm-worn shield” in adjacent sentences, a minor echo not at closure, so −0.2 only. Information density high—each sentence layers taste, touch, and emotional valence—prose rarely stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphorical, and plot work. Occasional lyrical overlap—“quaking reverie” appears twice within four lines—triggers minor paraphrase loop (−0.2). Metaphors stay internally coherent (stone synapses, liquid quartz moonlight). No filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines are crisp, propulsive. Overall rhythm breathes with escalation, but the loop keeps it from flawless polish.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but several sentences sprawl with stacked participles (“the stone arches pulsed with a rhythmic light, echoing the seeds of vigilance she felt within”). Metaphors stay consistent—light, seeds, prisms—yet occasional abstraction creep (“language of reality itself”) leans toward pseudo-profundity. No loops or paraphrase drift, but tighter cuts would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.6)
    Metaphors are vivid yet sometimes stack two-deep (“porcelain... trembling like a glass harp”) in the same sentence, creating faint purple tint. Repeated template “He [verb] gently, each [noun] [verb]” appears three times; not taught as pattern, so reads as cadence drift. Clause rhythm is musical but occasionally stalls momentum—e.g., three consecutive participial phrases describing light. Copy-clean; no typos or pronoun confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative layering serves pattern-building, not ornament. One scaffold loop (“hopeful melancholy” repeated thrice) and two near-paraphrase lines dull momentum slightly. No mixed metaphors; syntax breathes with scene tempo. Artifacts stay clear of closure—holds high band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense but musical; figurative chains serve accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; each image advances texture. One mixed metaphor—“windows black as midnight parchment” conflates transparency with writing surface—barely grazes clarity. Otherwise precise, varied rhythm; read-aloud ear test passes. High density fits 800-word ceiling without stall.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud cadence is musical, with purposeful repetition (“within motion,” “wildflower hush”) that teaches its pattern early and pays off in the final line. Some metaphor stacks verge on excess (“secret garden suspended in the sky,” “silent hymn that stretched across seasons”), but they never obscure causality or closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; pronoun antecedents stay clear. Final line lands with imagistic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often handles motion, sensory filter, and world rule. No loops or scaffold; “whirling silence” returns only when the image gains new weight. Metaphors (translucent coral, emerald fire) remain consistent with orchard/sea hybrid aesthetic and do not crowd high-pressure beats. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with gravity shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information density is high—one sentence often layers sensorial, emotional, and symbolic work (“shadows stretching like hopeful fingers” reprises the tarp threads and civic renewal). No paraphrase loops; each gust reading adds new vector data. Metaphors stay consistent (wind as ghost, compass as talisman) without contradictory vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; closing line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, momentum breathes with scene tides, and almost every line carries dual duty (e.g., “each echo a brushstroke that opened fissures”). Occasional stacked modifiers (“oscillating repose that mirrored the cavern’s own breathing ice”) flirt with overwriting but stay within the taught lyric pattern and do not obscure the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Figurative control: “seam of light pulsed, thin as a breath” is precise; mixed-metaphor risk avoided. Information density high—each driftwood piece, flute inversion, echo-catch does double narrative work. One micro-loop: “first light slipped… light slipped” in adjacent clauses; too minor to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm modulates from languid opening cadences to shorter pulses at the fragment crack, mirroring rising stakes. Figurative layering is dense but patterned, not cluttered; mixed metaphors are avoided. Occasional scaffold—“each borrowed personality seeped… each whispering a fraction”—is repetitive but does not obscure causality or dull the final image. Clean grammar and strong verbs throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, high density, few filters. Minor loop: “germinate” is over-leveraged (×5) and becomes incantatory rather than evolving; a single metaphor mix (“river of colors” vs “tunnel of shifting greens”) blurs spatial logic but not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate across participle, prepositional, and subject-start patterns. No loops or synonym churn; “shifted hush” returns only to reweight meaning. Figurative density is high but patterned early, so payoff justifies risk. Minor tightening: “the truth of her hypothesis crystallized” is tell-ish; a physical shard-image could have shown it.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm modulates from long botanical sentences to short filament clauses, supporting momentum. Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“loom of absence”) so reads as taught texture, not overwrite. One paraphrase loop—“stoically sparkling” repeated twice within four lines—triggers −0.2. Otherwise high density without scaffold; closure image clear.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence variety and ear-rhythm are strong; no template cadence runs. Occasional soft modifiers—“quietly determined,” “gently determined”—repeat stem without deepening nuance, a minor loop. Mixed metaphor “comet draped stalactite” is fleetingly strained yet visually anchored. Closure line “planet’s own steadfast chorus” skirts drumbeat but lands cleanly, so artifact touches do not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—world, body, metaphor—without clogging. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances map, shard, or crew. Metaphors stay internally consistent (light, weaving, lattice). Proofreading clean. Only micro-tick: two adjacent “whisper” uses 23 words apart; not enough to dull momentum or touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening. No loops or scaffold. Two adjacent “glow” references verge on repetition but are saved by refracting contexts (stone vs. pocket). Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to exhale”) is minor; closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.7)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“green stone walls humming,” “serpent of light”) and coherent under Accumulative lens. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Some sentences lean purple—“a chorus of silver syllables”—yet they serve imagistic crescendo rather than obscure causality. One paraphrase loop: “the wick’s glow intensified, feeding the prism…causing the beam to split” restates the same cause twice; minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density: “amber kettle,” “quietly explosive,” “sapphire ribbon” compress world and mood into single phrases. Rhythm modulates; no template cadence detected. One lapse—“quietly explosive” is used twice within 30 words, creating a micro-echo that slightly dulls the second hit. Otherwise metaphor vehicles stay coherent; no mixed logic or simultaneity errors. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lines are dense: “lattice of sorrow, each filament humming with a quantified sorrow” twins the noun for sonic pattern yet avoids paraphrase because the second adds measurability. Metaphors stay physically coherent—moonlight mending brass, filaments floating like sighs. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are purposeful. A single register twitch: “mundane miracle” verges on thesis-talk but is earned by prior imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphor chains serve the orchard’s transformation without overwriting. Occasional paraphrase loops (“woven dawns that knit communities together...binding strangers into families”) repeat across two adjacent sentences, a minor scaffold −0.2. Rhythm modulates with scene breath; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Closure line “the bound release become a permanent sunrise” lands clean, propelling the ear outward.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Loops are light: “enlarged tranquility” appears twice but earns reprise. Mixed metaphor cluster in first paragraph (“rain-kissed,” “secret sigh,” “nested paradox”) risks purple overload yet sets lyric contract. Filter verbs minimal; action is immediate. Final mirror image is crisp, no scaffold. A few adjectival softeners (“modest,” “gentle”) cushion tension that could have been sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sensitive ear-varied rhythm and high information density; occasional purple layering (“world tilt toward the ordinary,” “uncloak its hidden purpose”) and two paraphrase loops (“quiet protest that unmasked…”) prevent 8.0+, but prose never stalls momentum or blurs closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose carries high density: each sentence layers sensory data, metaphor, and causal nugget—e.g., “each measured degree whispered a promise back” simultaneously advances plot, theme, and temperature reading. Figurative language is patterned (ice, light, resonance) and pays off in the lantern constellation, avoiding mixed-metaphor penalties. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “each” anaphora beats could compress, but they occur early and do not ghost the closure. Rhythm modulates from hush to single pulse without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence can anchor smell, heritage, and stakes—“antique watch fob… warm from forgotten voyages.” Metaphors are clean and motivated: “comforting unease like a soft blanket” embodies her paradoxical calm. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances prop, choice, or atmosphere. No figurative muddle in the blackout beat where clarity is life-or-death.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm is deliberate and varied; paragraph cuts land on sensory beats. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor returns to taste/compass/aurora triad—so the overwriting cap is waived. One scaffold lapse: “luminous yet skeptical” repeats twice in adjacent sentences. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final line cadence earns its lullaby without lapsing into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Density is high: “each step resonated with an auroral sorrow” does triple duty—setting, emotion, foreshadowing. No loops; no filler verbs. Metaphors stay coherent (light = grief = creativity) without mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by image, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, high density: “the wind carried the taste of rust” does image double-duty (weather + decay). Each sentence either advances discovery or tightens atmosphere. Figurative language peaks only once, at the sky-vent beat, and the pattern has been ear-trained by earlier fragment glows, so the heightened metaphor feels earned. Opening and closing lines are crystalline, anchoring voice and resonance respectively.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry double duty—sound, light, motion compressed into single image-clusters; only occasional “glisten”/“glistens” loop edges toward synonym churn, not enough to dull closure. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“coaxes,” “bows,” “ripples”) propel. Rhythm breathes with sunrise-to-dusk arc, paragraph lengths visually swelling then ebbing. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif cleanly; minor elisions (“after words become unnecessary”) are pattern-taught and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathing: “the dome’s panels glowed, reflecting a mosaic of molten sky and cracked earth” does triple sensory work. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds texture or advances causality. One mixed metaphor—“glass dome throbbed with heat”—is minor. Rhythmic control peaks in the burn paragraph where longer sentences flare then contract into the quiet hiss of containment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Slight template cadence in “each note she heard…each paragraph she heard” and a touch of synonym churn (“sandstorm calm” thrice), but rhythm supports the accumulative design. Mixed metaphors are avoided; images stay coherent. Density is high—every sentence layers postcard, scent, or sound—without purple overload. Closure image is crisp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative density is high but sustains one coherent liquid-cipher register; metaphors (sea-foam lines, spider time) stay internally consistent. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or breath-pattern. Strong verbs—sang, twirled, clattered, sealed—carry motion sans modifiers. Final line cadence mirrors tide exhale, giving closure sonic snap. Minor POV adjective stacks (“rusted steel met the sigh of ancient tides”) forgiven because atmospheric stakes are the point.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: single sentences perform triple duty—“The sand fell away like sifted dreams, revealing a smooth slab etched with symbols that shimmered under the lantern's glow” advances action, setting, and metaphor cleanly. No synonym loops or template cadence; figurative language sparse except where pattern-taught (spiral, salt). Read-aloud rhythm pulses like quiet tide; paragraph cuts purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, sentences lengthening then curtailing to mimic breath-ritual. Metaphors are coherent—water as “molten glass,” sky as “veil”—and never mixed. One scaffold loop: “the quiet unfurled like silk” followed immediately by “spreading across the meadow” reiterates without new pressure. Otherwise density is high; each line layers image or causality. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences twin image and motion (“the garden’s night air felt suddenly conspiratorial” advances both atmosphere and social pact). Mixed metaphors are rare—“meteor shower painted silver streaks” is acceptable synesthesia. One paraphrase loop: “agreed upon lies” is repeated three times in close succession; the echo is thematic but still stalls the ear slightly. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (cracked, brushed, dissolved). Final line recharges “borrowed sugar” and “agreed upon lies” with earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythmic control is strong—long breathy sentences for dusk, shorter clauses at sunrise—but figurative density is saturated; nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, risking purple haze. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors occasionally clash: “roses unfurling like pale hands” beside “garden breathed” within two lines, yet garden as organism sustains, so logic holds. Information density is moderate; some lines repeat emotional gist in new imagery. Closure beat is clear despite ornament, so penalty stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned—ink/rose/stone/water—paid off when thorn glows and key melts. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. One paraphrase loop (“marble sanctuary under aurora” repeated near opening and close) is purposeful reprise, not artifact; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift from participial to subject-verb without template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“ice filaments through a loom of memory”) and paid off at closure, so penalty waived. One paraphrase loop detected—“each fragment mirrored the broken pieces of the snow globe / Each fragment mirrored…” within a single beat—triggers −0.2. No mixed metaphors; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, with liturgical cadence that supports the accumulative design; sentence openings vary. Some metaphor density in firefly descriptions borders on purple but is pattern-taught and re-cited at closure, so tolerated. No scaffold loops or paraphrase churn; each sentence advances image or concept. Occasional elevated diction (“scintillatingly somber”) is motivated by tone tag, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is scaffold-free: no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn, no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“wounded star” for the diamond—never overwrought. Each sentence at least dual-purpose: “She collected them, sorting fragments by ink hue, paper grain, and the faint scent of ozone” simultaneously reveals method, obsession, and world detail. Opening line anchors stakes, final line (“truth could bloom”) reprises orchard-as-garden image without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    cadence is deliberate and read-aloud musical, but near-duplicate phrasing (“lyrically prophetic,” “ancient shadows,” “variant allegiance”) cycles six times, blunting momentum. Metaphors occasionally tangle (“stormlit observatory above clouds” is clear; “scaffold for tomorrow’s light” is abstract). Still, the lyric loop is pattern-taught early and sustains coherence through the close.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is musical—varied rhythm, strong verbs—but figurative density clusters heavily in every sentence of the climax, slightly muffling causal beats. One paraphrase loop (“the sea’s sigh now a lullaby of redemption” echoing earlier “tide’s own sigh”) and occasional template cadence (“she… she… she…”) keep it from top-tier compression.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative language is selective: only two metaphors per high-pressure beat, each extending the magnetic/ice conceit. Sentence variety supports breath and surge; no template cadence runs. One near-loop—“patient revolution” repeated at open and close—is earned thematic reprise, not scaffold. Clarity never buckles; information density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic—every sentence advances image or causality. Few modifiers, strong verbs (“echoed,” “surged,” “loosen”). No paraphrase loops; metaphor chain (droplets→memories→stars) is coherent and payoff-linked. One clause drifts toward abstraction (“controlling influence of the city’s old bureaucratic neglect”) but occurs mid-text, not in closure beat, so penalty minor.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “coat bore the weight of iron bars and whispered confessions” does triple duty (setting, backstory, body). Metaphors stay coherent—sunbeam as moral ignition—without purple sprawl. One paraphrase loop (“vibrant hush” repeated) but it is pattern-taught and pays off in closure beat. No scaffold sentences; strong verbs (“traced,” “clasped”) replace modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences layer metaphor upon metaphor; at times three consecutive lines each carry a new vehicle (“rebellious kite,” “rusted gears shudder,” “acid vapors crack”) without pattern-payoff, blurring physical logic. Loops of “the ___ sea” and “the ___ gears” create template cadence. Information density is high, but overwriting softens the final image’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long lyric sentence for choir-of-data opener, then staccato discoveries (“17, 42, 108—spiking”). Information density is high; every sentence advances archive lore or Lia’s tactic. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay consistent (sound/echo motif). One mixed metaphor—“glow… whispered echoing verses”—is minor, does not obscure causality. Closure image is clean, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but stacked abstract metaphors (“tickling metronome against the hull of distant icebergs”) risk purple overgrowth. Information density dips where setting description repeats the same cold/light binaries. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. No scaffold loops or synonym churn, but two near-repetitive clauses (“wind sang…lullaby”) appear in closing beat, dulling final edge. Metaphors stay coherent within lyric logic; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high—each sentence layers image, emotion, and conceptual turn—sustaining momentum through accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong rhythmic control; sentence length varies to mirror seasonal inhale/exhale. Figurative layer is dense but purposeful—every metaphor rooted in vineyard body. No mixed metaphors; “liquid memory” is earned. One minor scaffold: “gentle hush…gently persuasive” proximity loop (−0.2). Information density high; each sentence advances image or interiority. Clean copy, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush but loop-free; metaphors are sand-lit and coherent. Occasional pleated phrasing—“a conduit of calm and truth”—leans toward thesaurus uplift yet stays within established lyric register. Rhythm modulates: longer lull sentences for heat, shorter fragments at night-breath, sustaining momentum without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with paragraph breaths matching emotional swells; no template cadence runs. Figurative density is high—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is set in paragraph 1 and sustains cohesion, so −0.3 instead of heavier penalty. Mixed metaphor count is low; “vines climb… feeding the story” is the single physical-logic stretch, forgiven as animism. Occasional scaffolding: “the assembled arcs formed” repeats the prior sentence’s content, one paraphrase loop (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths contract around light-crescendo, then lengthen into quiet echo. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors; “sonically reflective” is patterned early and paid off. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, knowledge, or stakes. One minor filter cluster (“she realized… she could trace…”) but occurs pre-closure and does not dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric density is purposeful; metaphors (sea-foam breath, ghost-ship horn) stay within fog-tide logic. Occasional modifier stacks (“mist-laden paths,” “translucent monolith”) flirt with overwrite but serve atmosphere. No paraphrase loops; each image advances texture. Final two sentences crystallize without clutter—ear-test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense: each sentence layers light, sound, and motion. Metaphors stay internally coherent (starlight filament, sunrise hum). Occasional stacked epithets (“luminous ache,” “radiant sigh”) flirt with purple, but the beat is meditative, not frantic, so density feels earned. No loops, no scaffold, no simultaneity errors; clauses track sequentially. A single-slip would be the late-introduced “escape velocity” phrase—technically precise yet lyrically abstract—but it rings rather than grates.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence advances image or cadence. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled, with vehicles (vinyl = memory shard) kept consistent. One mixed metaphor risk—“quiet duty settle like dew” versus cloud hospice—barely grazes clarity. Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic without drumbeat monotony; paragraph cuts are deliberate, each anchored to a sensory beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and musical; sentences vary in length, avoid template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“time folded back on itself”—never clustering to obscure causality. One minor scaffold: “quietly deliberate method” is repeated almost verbatim; a −0.2 loop keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Almost zero scaffold; only micro-loop is “honeyed hush” echoed four times, but it functions as pulse track, not filler. Metaphors stay coherent (icicle drip = spiral score) and serve information density; final clause “stitched together a future where pain could rest in honeyed hush” lands without syntactic drag.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“mist…curling like applause around her shoulders”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral as compass, current as逆流—without muddled logic. Minor elevated diction (“feral nexus”) reads intentional, voice-motivated. Final line cadence mirrors inhale/exhale, satisfying ear.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts tight. Few scaffold phrases; one near-loop (“golden stories… golden halo… golden threads”) is earned by motif. Metaphors stay coherent (light = story = pollen). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Information density high; each line does dual atmospheric-character work. Minor prop certainty: lyre origin given in one clause, sufficient for lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful; no mixed metaphors or template cadence. Each sentence layers job: “Each discarded shard she arranged in spirals, mimicking the pulse of a heart” = action, metaphor, stakes. Opens with anchoring concrete triad: who/where/when. Final line “awaiting the next heartbeat to map” supplies resonant cadence without overwriting. Minor scaffolding—“she felt” filter appears twice—drops score from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function (“suspended from a rusted arch, dangled a broken timer mechanism, its gears half-exposed, its ticking halted by a missing tooth” sets object, stakes, and metaphor in one breath). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent within light/echo domain. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested memorable. Minor filter verb (“he sensed”) is voice-motivated, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Metaphor density borders on purple overload (“dreamlike fog of memory,” “kelp in a tide”) yet stays purposeful to the lyric-accumulative mode. No mixed vehicles or paraphrase loops, but several template cadence runs (“the… the… the…”) stall propulsion. Scaffolding is light; final image clarity survives. The prose sings itself into a lull but never accelerates breath under peak pressure because no true pressure exists.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies, read-aloud ear test passes; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor (steam veins, amber vault, tail-curl steam) recharges the same grief-transmutation axis, so coherence survives. One mixed risk: “rust-hued peace” / “amber blanket” overlap slightly in color space but do not contradict physics. Information density strong; minor filter verbs (“seemed to hold”) do not cluster in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies from pulsing anaphora to clipped final stride, propelling the accumulative design. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “metallic heart,” “quilt of regrets,” “golden ribbons” all orbit the machine-versus-memory axis. One scaffold paraphrase (“each ripple a silent testimony to the passing of time”) is permitted under lyric license and does not recur. No loops or register drift in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong information density—most sentences perform dual duty of image and engineering logic. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. However, three near-adjacent “dormant” repeats and a scaffold clause (“the abandoned spaceport hummed quietly, its revived pulse echoing the promise of hope she had engineered”) dull the final beat. Artifact touches closure-adjacent line, disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    High figurative density risks purple but stays coherent because every metaphor serves the tactile stakes (clocks, rain, crystal breath). One paraphrase loop: “excruciatingly gentle” appears 5×; repetition is thematic but edges toward scaffold. Otherwise lines are lean, propulsive, and do dual duty. Final amber spill is image-rich yet uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, high information density (“antique pocket sundial, its brass face dulled by centuries of dust and forgotten suns” telescopes age, function, cosmology). Metaphors are coherent—water sings, time bends, architecture unravels—without self-contradiction. Rhythm modulates: languid glide → metallic scrape → sunrise crescendo. A single hairline slip: “serene upheaval” is used twice; the repetition is purposeful cadence but still a micro-loop, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    Metaphor density is high but coherent—fulgurite, tide, serpent—taught as collector’s perceptual code. Occasional template cadence (“He… then he…”) appears twice but does not stall closure. No mixed metaphors; spatial choreography clean across dock, rope, chest. Minor paraphrase loops (“oceanic hush” variants) deduct.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence layers job—image, motion, metaphor, forward pull. Rhythm modulates from long leaf-rustle clauses to fragment “He smiled.” Figurative vehicles stay internally coherent: thread as sun, rose as waypoint. Opening and final lines frame voice and re-charge motif. No overwrite; density is earned, not stacked.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but stacked metaphors in peak beats (“bitterly sweet aria…quaking reverie…suspended garden”) create paraphrase loops that dilute propulsion. Filter-verb clusters (“seemed to mock…seemed to listen”) soften immediacy. Line density is high—many sentences carry dual duty—yet figurative excess obscures causal clarity at closure. One mixed metaphor: “stone could be pulled into the sky” momentarily breaks physics logic.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varied; read-aloud flows without template cadence. Figurative layering is dense (>60% of sentences metaphoric) but patterned—sand=ember, clouds=migrating chorus—so allowed under taught-pattern rule. One scaffold: repeated “she whispered a vow / black sand whispered stories” could tighten. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ear-test rhythm: paragraph lengths swell and contract like breath; no template cadence. Figurative density is high yet patterned (light = memory = firefly = star), taught early and paid off. One mixed metaphor: “sidereal patience stretched beyond earthly clocks” is abstract, but rescued by concrete inhalation of silence. No loops, no scaffold, no clarity artifacts at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is lush yet controlled: assonant cadences, varied sentence lengths, no scaffold loops. Occasional stacked modifiers ("slow, mournful tides") flirt with purple but stay in voice. Information per sentence high; each image advances atmosphere or symbolic layering. No mis-tagged pronouns or tense drift; opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush yet selective; each sentence layers image or sound without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors (“flock of butterflies” carrying sorrow fragments) risk conceptual clutter but stay legible. Filter verbs minimal; strong nouns/verbs dominate. Final paragraph achieves rhythmic cadence that mirrors ribbon coiling. One notch below 8+ because metaphor density peaks at closure, slightly dulling causal edge.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor (ink-tide, molten rose, cymbal-waves) advances atmosphere without crowding a single beat. Minor loop—“inscriptions glowing” appears twice within five lines—dulls rather than charges, but the repetition is local and does not obscure closure. Opening and final lines frame and echo with cadence precision; paragraph cut test passes—every block advances breath, image, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    High figurative density risks purple overload (“velveteen gloom,” “cobalt silo under stars”) but pattern is taught early and pays off at finale. No mixed metaphors; each image reappears to reweight meaning. Minor template cadence in “he… then he…” sequence (−0.2). Final line ear-tests strong; closure image unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and musical; most sentences carry double duty (image + causality). Occasional template cadence (“its surface a mirror… its frozen lake reflecting”) keeps it from 9-band. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative language is dense but patterned—radio glow as “fireflies trapped in amber” teaches the luminous motif that recurs in ink and dust, paying off at climax. Mixed-metaphor risk is avoided by keeping vehicles within the organic/electronic palette. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence either advances transcription action or thickens atmospheric texture. Occasional adjectival stacks (“shortwave radio dial glow”) read as voice rather than padding.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences alternate with fragment beats ("A soft luminescence emerged"). Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interiority: "walls stretched toward a single vanishing point, turning every step into a slow surrender to perspective"). Figurative language is patterned and paid off: ash/scatter/porcelain lattice returns in final image. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent "she whispered" lines paraphrase; deduction −0.2. No register drift, no simultaneity errors, no filter-verb clusters. Opening and closing lines are sharp anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is textured yet lean—every sentence at least doubles duty (image + concept). No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (cog = heartbeat, sediment = text). Strong nouns/verbs: “silt,” “sync,” “seep.” One mixed metaphor hairline: “abrasive calm” recurs but never visually embodied beyond adjective pair. Grammar clean; opening and closing lines carry punch. Information density high, momentum steady. No artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally clean, with purposeful metaphor chains (music/silence) that accumulate rather than stall. Two mild scaffold spots: “each a fragment of a vanishing art that once filled festivals and battlefields alike” adds encyclopedic flourish; “across unlearning hatred” pre-positions an abstraction before scene earns it. No loop artifacts in final third; rosette image lands uncluttered. Strong auditory specificity—“breath that seemed to pull autumn leaves into dance”—keeps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, body, and stakes—“She set a copper kettle over a fire made from salvaged solar panels, letting the water hiss as if the air itself were whispering.” No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (rust → ruby veins). Occasional elevated diction (“synaptic plasticity,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by conceptual frame and POV’s intellectual bent. Closure line is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences breathe with dusk cadence. Information density high—each sentence layers metaphor and action. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned (light = nectar, sound = echo) and pays off. Minor overwriting: “tower sang with the echo of its own heartbeat” is mixed metaphor (towers don’t sing with hearts) but occurs after closure so does not obscure final image. Overall propulsion clean.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; most lines layer image and theme. Occasional perfume—“daydream” as verb, “lazy thoughts across the quiet bay”—approaches purple but stays pattern-consistent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor (“tide that never ceases” alongside “dust on shoulders”) is minor enough to keep below artifact threshold. Final line cadence earns its quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with paragraphic tides; sentence openings vary between participial drift and noun-chiseled declaration. Occasional modifier stacks (“foxglove-stained glass ampoule, its violet veins catching light”) flirt with density but serve iridescent effect. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each recurrence reweights the image. A single near-mixed metaphor (“threads of a loom” underwater) is forgivable amid otherwise precise sensory economy.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density, no filler; each sentence pilots image and concept simultaneously. Metaphors stay consistent (wounded star, breathing marble) without purple drift. Minor scaffold echo (“each step a…”) is pattern-taught and paid off—acceptable. No loops obscure the final image; read-aloud cadence breathes with escalation.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Infinite staircase + perpetual motion dice is fresh synthesis; trope of flawed randomness driving infinity feels inevitable in hindsight. The chipped die as constant offset that stabilizes motion is a non-obvious engineering twist. Risk of abstraction is high, but specificity of bronze frame / glass disc grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density—most sentences layer pigment, memory, and civic haze simultaneously. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph lengths vary. A faint scaffold loop—“each stroke a promise / each line a syllable”—but it’s motif-taught, not artifact clutter. Mixed metaphor (“lantern… breathed a saffron quiet”) is audacious yet coherent under painterly lens; no clarity break. Closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.5)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence; density risk is partially offset by accumulative design, yet metaphors sometimes stack (“echoing the waterfall that roared”) and create minor coherence drag. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Several near-paraphrase pairs (“displaced persons, refugees of a vanished valley”) could be tightened. Closure image avoids purple overload, saving 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “latent radiance spilled onto the cracked floor like a dying star” compresses light, mortality, and spatial grounding in one image. No filter-verb clusters, no scaffold loops; each sentence either advances mechanism or sharpens atmosphere. Metaphors stay coherent—yoyo as prayer-wheel, stone as stellar conduit—without mixed collisions. Opening and closing lines act as dovetail joints, locking tide and light into circular time. A single 9+ gate requires zero artifacts; this clears, but one near-purple “mournful rhythm” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, but metaphor density is high in every sentence of the climax beat (“ribbons of black smoke,” “nauseating aurora,” “spray of ink”) creating slight purple fog that dulls causal clarity. Several near-repeats: “repulsive allure” appears three times with identical phrasing; “lingering luminance” cycles six times—template cadence rather than escalating image. No paraphrase loops, but stacked modifiers strain (“photographically cursed rose” used as noun pile). Grammar is clean; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.7)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence shapes, high sensory density. Overwriting flashes: “restless euphony” 2×, “sketched resonance” 3×; “fractal…echoing loops…mirrored” cluster without taught pattern justification. Mixed metaphors: seaweed twisting around driftwood circles followed by “exploded outward” ripples—physics clash. No paraphrase loops, but glittering diction stack in final third caps score beneath 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Information-dense lines (“the city… perched on the backs of gargantuan turtles that trudged eternally…”) world-build without stall. Mixed-metaphor vigil is avoided; vehicles (molten ribbon, ancient scarps) stay sea-tectonic. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances discovery or pressure. Rhythm breathes with discovery beats, then compresses at tunnel emergence. Reed whistle’s thin tone skittering is tactile and fresh. Closure line is crisp image, no overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold, zero loops; each sentence advances image or causation. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“ivy… green veins that pulsed”) and paid off when veins retreat under light. No mixed metaphors, no register drift; “moonlit water” is the single lyrical reach and it’s apt for silver ink. Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentence for arrival, staccato triad for prying, crystalline final line: “truth… would travel onward on unseen rails.” Proofing flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“skeletal fingers,” “cloak of flame.” Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, historical echo, and bodily risk. Rhythm breathes—long sentence of pavilion description followed by clipped “She waded.” Only micro-slip: “hushed blaze” used twice; second instance could vary.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and largely loop-free; however, “dappled resolve” recurs four times, creating template cadence that dulls the final paragraph. Mixed metaphors (“quiet proof,” “tangible foundation”) stack in closure beat, slightly blurring the image. Information density is high; every sentence advances cataloguing or myth-testing. Minor scaffold sentences appear (“She was tranquilly perceptive…”) but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, yet figurative density averages >1 metaphor per sentence; in the final third this tips into purple haze that dulls the closure image. Mixed metaphor risk: “origami cranes…tiny satellites toward the basilica’s crown” layers vehicle on vehicle. Template cadence appears: “He lifts…He watches…He smiles” triple openers near end, noticeable because earlier syntax varied. No paraphrase loops, but redundant anaphora (“the lantern maker…”) costs propulsion; still, grammar is clean and pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensorium, tool-action, and conceptual map. Metaphors are coherent—geode as suns, deck as patient heart—and do not stack in crisis beats. Minor scaffold: “hum” repeated four times; justified by resonance motif so penalty waived. Final line cadence lands cleanly without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long lyrical sentences build to hum, then staccato “She pressed a slender lever.” Metaphors stay internally coherent (chip veins = heart, stone aurora = echo) and pay off in final image. One template cadence spotted—“the brilliant dimness that...” repeated twice—minor loop, not touching closure. No mixed vehicles or purple overload; information density high.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic variety and high information density; occasional stacked modifiers (“night-black water,” “tempered regret”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality. One template loop—“the weight of…” repeated in adjacent sentences—dulls momentum slightly before the close.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. One paraphrase loop—“furrowed hush” repeated within 30 words—subtracts a fraction. Metaphors (moon as metronome, pull as compass) stay coherent and physically grounded. Clause variety and paragraph rhythm support the Accumulative cadence, propelling toward the final sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is dense—sunrise painting, liquid glass—but pattern is taught early and pays off in final image. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. One minor scaffold: “flickering faith” is repeated four times without new inflection; still, it charges closure, so penalty is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence variety and sonic layering propel the read-aloud ear; only minor filter-verb clusters (“felt oddly comforting”) dull immediacy. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent. Density high—most lines do double duty. Artifacts minor, do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor extends the moon-fire-plant axis; no mixed vehicles. Occasional cadence loops—“ever steady, ever loving, ever bound”—slow final momentum; a 0.3 deduction for ornamental triad that repeats prior beat without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    High figurative density risks purple overload—every sentence carries a metaphor—but the piece teaches that lyric texture is its idiom, so the mode is earned. A few mixed metaphors (“the glade seemed to inhale, the air thickening with a choking beauty”) slightly muddle physical logic. No paraphrase loops or template beats; pronouns and tense are clean. Final paragraph achieves luminous cadence yet would benefit from one stark concrete anchor to cut the haze.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varies: spondaic hull-hums, then liquid pre-rupture anaphora. Metaphors stay coherent (tear as needle, fireflies as photons), no mixed vehicles. One scaffold near start (“patched panels humming…”) quickly absorbed into action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and emotional work. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to short pulses (“The glass trembled”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally coherent. Minor overwrite: “smoldering amber” + “velvet black” in same sentence flirts with purple, but it’s contained within a single beat and doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: “luminous fort…loomed like a sleeping giant” sets tonal metaphor then cedes to concrete action. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds either sensory precision or causal step. Figurative layering is high but patterned—light, pulse, spark—so coherence holds. Peak beat (“cascade of invisible currents”) avoids purple by anchoring in bodily effect: “fluttered through the fort’s veins.”

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “violet ribbons of aurora painted the night sky” packs sight and motion in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent (dust = powdered iron, flame = second sunrise) and never clash. Scaffolding is minimal—only two instances of “the tide… the tide…” that drum mildly. Information dual-loads throughout: “She placed the final stone, bright red” simultaneously marks sequence apex and color code. A single mixed image—“promise settle like a mantle upon her shoulders”—slips toward cliché, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: thunder-long sentences vs. single-beat “timer clicked.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—storm as parchment, scars as cities—without mixed vehicles. Information density high: timetable hollow, 23-minute exactitude, glowing ink all serve closure. Minor template cadence in “He…He…” ascent sentences (−0.2), but does not touch final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual breath. Figurative density is high but patterned early, so forgiven. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “rusted,” “blooming,” “luminous fracture” recur with semantic escalation, not padding. One mixed metaphor risk—“veins of light” beside “mosaic of green light”—but both serve the same body/garden conceit, so coherence holds. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the image carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Metaphor density is high but coherent—film reel, tide, arbor, clock form one sustained cinematographic fugue; no mixed vehicles violate physics. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, paragraphs sculpted for visual breath. Only micro-loop: “steely longing” appears three times within 100 words mid-text; the reprise is purposeful, not scaffold, so minimal deduction. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and echo, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density: single sentences fuse sensory, symbolic, and plot work (“lanterns…flickering like questions in a bright hall of doubt”). One paraphrase loop on monsoon deadline noted above costs −0.2. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay physical. No template cadence. Final third clean—no artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varied. Minor hedge: “tasted of citrus and rain” could compress, but does not stall beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density high but patterned; mixed metaphors (“lace instructions,” “tide of remembrance”) coexist without collision. Loops appear: “rhythmically placid” repeated conceptually; “diffuse/diffusing” 3× in closing paragraph. Scaffold evident in stacked participial phrases that slow momentum. Clarity intact, but cadence grows hypnotic rather than propulsive—acceptable for accumulative design yet caps excellence.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“wounded beast,” “garden ghosts”) and paid off (“breathing sanctuary”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“kindled humility,” “stripped drama”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence variety supports rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with declarative summary, but image carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Rhythm varies effectively, though occasional overwriting appears (“glass towers, reflecting the first pale light and amplifying the drifting resonance”). One paraphrase loop: “stubborn spark that refused to die” / “spark that refused to die” conceptually echoed later. Figurative language is mostly coherent, but “charcoal stacked like black snow” slightly muddles texture (snow implies softness; charcoal is gritty). Closure beat remains clear despite minor density.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: “frozen cathedral,” “ghostly harp,” “rose veins” serve atmosphere and theme. However, figurative density occasionally borders on overwriting (“invisible music,” “lighthouse beam” tremor)—not muddled, but near the threshold. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “silently expressive” appears twice with slight redundancy. Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, but “living bridge between loss and wonder” edges toward abstraction. Momentum holds, yet one or two lines flirt with purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“boots echoing through the water as if they were footsteps on a grave” merges sound, metaphor, and profession). Rhythm varies effectively: long, flowing sentences for atmosphere; short pulses for action (“He placed the last shard”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“fractured hope,” “chased stillness”) borders on purple but serves tone. No loops or scaffold; every image advances plot or theme. Closure beat (“silhouette merging with the lantern’s gleam”) is clear, resonant, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “lanterns flickering like fireflies” conveys hope, scale, and transience in one image. Figurative language is purposeful but slightly dense in peak beats (e.g., “knowledge curled like smoke” risks abstraction). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“Mara had been...”, “She would declare...”, “Night fell...”). Final paragraph’s “reflected glow of the bell’s echo” borders on mixed metaphor but sustains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“arches humming with the secret of bloom,” “exhale turned violet”—but occasionally overloads figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., “chest expand like a lantern,” “lattice of glowing potential”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “breathing changes” appears as near-summary late. Sentence variety supports rhythm; closure image (“blossoms now glowed with the memory of compassion”) is resonant and clean. One minor mixed metaphor (“map of veins that throbbed”) slightly muddles clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“vaporous threads that stitched the present to the past,” “Möbius strip of foliage”—but avoids overwriting through rhythmic variation and concrete anchors. Sentences advance atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously. Minor flaw: slight synonym churn in “dissolve,” “disintegrate,” “peeling away” across adjacent lines, creating a faint loop. No scaffold or template cadence; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final line (“a reverie that quaked with the promise of endless discovery”) resolves with charged specificity, echoing the opening’s “mutable sanctuary.”

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“rusted cathedral,” “forgotten throat,” “sleeping hearts”), though occasional figurative stacking (“sky that seemed perpetually twilight,” “air thrum with possibility”) risks slight overwriting. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for two adjacent metaphors in the descent (“forgotten throat,” “pulse with quiet vitality”) that border on redundancy without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Sentence openings vary (“The sunken…”, “Within…”, “She had come…”), avoiding monotony. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “ashen forge under the trembling aurora that rippled across the brine, its soot-gray fire feeding on the void between stars” stacks modifiers without propulsion. One paraphrase loop: “broken trust and new hope” / “past betrayals and future hope” dilutes closure impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often doing double duty (e.g., rails “humming like distant heartbeats” conveys sound and mood). But overwriting creeps in: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“glimmered,” “glowed,” “luminous disbelief”), and metaphors occasionally strain (“petal’s vibration echo like a heartbeat”). Final paragraph avoids summary, closing on strong image. Minor scaffold in mid-story (“she understood… she realized…”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, high information per line, and rhythmic variation. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “veins of glass,” “thawing heart,” and “kaleidoscope of colors” verge on stacked modifiers, slightly blurring clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the final paragraph risks ornamental flourish (“laugh at the seriousness”) over propulsion. Still, sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts serve emotional beats, and the read-aloud ear test passes with nuanced cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors (“metal shelves groaning like old bones”) are consistent. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“trembling certainty” appears twice; “betrayal... weapon” then “betrayal... beacon”). The phrase “stunt-trained eye” followed by decoding via “stunt move I had rehearsed” verges on scaffold repetition. No fatal artifacts, but density in peak beats slightly blurs propulsion—e.g., “amber fire ripple through my veins” after “pulsing with amber light.”

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion: “phantom serpent” and “river of stars” verge on mixed metaphor, and “ambered hush” repeats four times without evolving function. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm, but two adjacent lines paraphrase (“summarizing silence” / “quiet between gusts unfolded into symbols”) triggering a minor loop penalty. Still, information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously—and the final paragraph’s cadence lands with earned resonance, avoiding scaffold or purple excess at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “looped timelines protocol… creating subtle feedback”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“crystalline chord that vibrated the courtyard walls, each note carrying a whisper…”), slightly muddying causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one run of participle openings (“scattering… brushing… completing…”) risks monotony. Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “eavesdropping through the lens of honesty” borders on mixed metaphor, and “resonant hush” repeats four times, verging on scaffold. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with the scene’s mood. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, though “ambiguously clear” recurs as both motif and slight redundancy. Still, information density remains high, and closure image shines clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion: “coaxing each crack to reflect the garden’s own tentative bloom” and “lattice of truth” verge on abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“polished marble,” “freshly polished marble”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with the ritual. However, the final third’s elevated diction (“measured hymn,” “conceptual repricing” implied) risks register drift, though it doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, concrete verbs, and high information density. However, figurative language occasionally overloads peak beats—e.g., “amber arcs,” “frozen strings,” “cold fire” in close proximity risk purple prose. One paraphrase loop: “subdued awakenings” appears three times with minimal variation. These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+; momentum remains intact due to rhythmic control and purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“lanterns flickered, their light no longer trembling but steady as a promise” links image, emotion, and closure). Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “wordless exchange of reverence” edges toward abstraction, and “spaces in between the sounds that the ghost had kept sacred” risks label-speak. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences slightly paraphrase the water’s effect (“imprints merged… creating images” / “resembled ancient staff lines”). Clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bruised gold” dawn, “frail stems of the illustration’s vines,” “cloud that knows its own density.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (smudging = questioning) and pays off in glowing ink. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“swaying certainties of weather and memory intertwined”) slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure image lands with crystalline clarity—no artifact obscures cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: “rusted artery of stone,” “frozen syllables,” “steel ribs” create figurative density without payoff. Paraphrase loops appear (“drowsy alertness” repeated verbatim three times; “ghost shift” invoked six times with minimal variation). Final third suffers from scaffold sentences (“He realized…”, “He chose…”, “He emerged…”) that tell rather than embody. Still, rhythm varies purposefully, and key images land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“stone floor softened,” “silence grew louder”). Figurative language is coherent (library as living organism, silence as healing agent) and pattern-taught. Minor overwriting in “regenerative silence flooded his senses, erasing the weight of centuries”—slightly abstract—but immediately grounded by “cold fingers brushing his cheek.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; most lines multitask (e.g., “branches cradling the sky like hands” conveys setting, metaphor, and theme). However, adjacent paraphrase loops appear: “cautious exuberance bubbling… mixture of awe and professional responsibility” restates emotional state. Figurative density peaks during eclipse without payoff—“shadow pulse like living heart” isn’t echoed later. Final paragraph tightens effectively, but mid-story has minor scaffold (“she believed that…”) that could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “pages curled like scorched leaves” conveys state, history, and fragility in one image. Figurative language is consistent (tactile/musical motifs: hum, pulse, cadence) with no mixed metaphors. Template cadence avoided; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm effectively. One paraphrase loop: “fragments of memory, each faint flicker” slightly redundant, but not in peak beats. Closure lines (“stories walls have heard are finally being gathered”) land cleanly without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “captured reality that could be read only under a microscope of whispered light” strains metaphor coherence. Adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“steering ships through fog” / “guiding those who dared to listen”). Sentence openings vary well, but figurative density in peak beats risks muddle—e.g., “encoded breaths,” “newly forged key of humanity.” Final paragraph’s “flag of revelation” verges on mixed metaphor. Still, rhythm supports theme, and most lines advance atmosphere or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language, but occasional overwriting risks clarity: “rosary of reverberations,” “rhetorical devices that dripped like honey over stone” verge on mixed metaphor. However, the pattern is taught early and pays off—the indigo “spill like ink onto the air” directly enables the climax. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and information density is high (e.g., “muffled clarity” does thematic, atmospheric, and tonal work). Minor deduction for two adjacent lines restating “unraveling stillness” without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density (“phosphorescent memory,” “frost-etched glass”) and rhythmic propulsion, varying sentence length to mirror breath and baton strokes. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “shards of light that cascaded down the spire, each shard a baton of luminous sound” slightly stacks modifiers, risking blur. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere or character. Closure beat (“lake shimmering with color, each ripple a note”) remains clear despite lyric intensity, avoiding artifact penalties that would block 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “darkening brightness that seemed to swallow the lingering mist”). Sentence openings vary, and rhythm accelerates toward climax. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “fractured timelines, flickering like broken mirrors” followed immediately by “periodically eternal” creates slight metaphor bloat. One paraphrase loop: “retrace the steps… mapping each fork” restates intent without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful: metaphors (“yawned like a throat of stone,” “splintered like a jagged filament of hush”) are coherent and sustained. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“invisible ribbons,” “ghostly drumheads”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One near-redundancy: “mirrored hush” appears three times, but each use deepens meaning. Final image (“droplet of feeling a tiny drumbeat”) earns its lyricism without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sky bruised violet,” “vines like whispered secrets,” “breathing fountain” do triple duty. Minor redundancy in “layered tranquility” repeated three times—slight paraphrase loop—but not in closure beat. Figurative language is coherent (storm = silence, truth = breath). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No scaffold or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density: “amber glass panes caught the dying light like mute witnesses” establishes tone, setting, and motif in one clause. Minor overwriting occurs in the vapor description (“collage of moments… distant echo of a forgotten hymn”), where figurative density briefly edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary effectively. Final paragraph’s “crystal shadows cling to his coat like silent witnesses” echoes the opening cleanly, though “teach the world how tears were born from fragrance” risks slight thematic overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“frays echoing the sighs of those who had once dared to slip through bars of light” conveys history, texture, and emotion). Figurative language is coherent—rope consistently symbolizes connection/memory—but occasionally overused in high-pressure beats (e.g., “tapestry of time,” “marrow of the universe” risk purple prose). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor redundancy in “pattern” descriptions slightly dulls propulsion, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—“flickering with the last embers of a rainforest that had once burned itself to ash” establishes tone without overwriting. Minor redundancy in “unfinished world” / “story left untold” slightly dulls momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the lingering refrain, with syntactic variety supporting emotional cadence. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “walls humming with low, resonant static that seemed to taste of old rain” establishes setting, mood, and sensory logic). Figurative language is pattern-taught (static as emotional sensor) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “vortex of colors forming… each hue a fragment of a story” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the opening, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“constellations twinkled like lanterns,” “mind swirling like the sea breezes”), risking figurative density in calm beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “cautious exuberance” appears thrice as a near-label. Sentence variety sustains momentum, and the final line (“negotiate... the flow of kindness”) recharges the opening cargo motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but patterns are taught early (“whispering” reeds, “luminescent ache”) and paid off cohesively. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“webs of kinship Arlen had imagined” slightly redundant after prior descriptions), costing clarity points. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the end restate the orchard’s sigh and ache, triggering a −0.2 paraphrase penalty. Otherwise, rhythm, diction, and propulsion are masterful, with strong verbs and specific nouns (“phosphorescent moss,” “black glass bark”).

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with image and metaphor, but largely avoids overwriting—figurative language serves momentum (“city rose like a lattice of stone ribs,” “ripples turned into a spiral staircase of light”). Minor redundancy in “borrow time” phrasing (lines 6, 10, 14), and one paraphrase loop (“interrupted cadence… began, faltered, then resumed” echoed later). No scaffold sentences or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s “chasing the next interrupted cadence” perfectly echoes the opening, creating resonant closure without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, each sentence advancing atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“In a cavern…”, “After the orchard…”, “He carried…”), and paragraph lengths shift to mirror pacing. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“polished ivory gleaming as if they held a secret heartbeat”), but metaphors remain coherent within the established logic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; the only artifact is slight thesaurus-itis (“amber fog,” “luminous petals”), but it doesn’t obscure closure. Final line (“ever‑lasting wonder”) risks sentimentality but is anchored by preceding concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“exhaled a cool breath of dust and ink”), but risks overwriting: “sapphire hush” appears four times, verging on motif fatigue. Minor redundancy in describing the reel’s pulse (“faintly,” “faint echo,” “soft blue glow”). No paraphrase loops, but figurative density in high-pressure beats slightly dulls propulsion. Final image lands cleanly despite slight cadence repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “droplets that refracted light like tiny prisms” conveys optics, beauty, and invitation in one image. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the storm’s cadence, and paragraphs shift purposefully. However, slight overwriting appears in mid-story (“laboratory of patience, each droplet a data point…”), where figurative density risks tipping into abstraction. No loops or scaffolding, but one near-paraphrase: “reconstruct by releasing control” recurs with minimal variation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “bruised” sky, “salt-slick stones,” “pulse like a heartbeat” all advance atmosphere and theme. Minor overwriting occurs in the climax (“meaning… pour into the air, each hue… coalescing into a single, trembling note of hope”)—a slight figurative stack that borders on abstraction. Otherwise, sentences vary rhythmically, avoid templates, and carry multiple duties. No loops or scaffolding; every line serves momentum. Final image (“ribbon of rain threading through stone”) crystallizes the story’s textural logic without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense with figurative language—often exquisite (“shadows moved like slow tides,” “laughter ripples like a warm breeze”)—but overwriting blurs propulsion in peak beats. Adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“overlapping shadows that moved like slow tides… slipping through each other… dance that let unseen forces inhabit the space”) creating mild synonym churn. Mixed metaphors emerge: shadows “weave,” then “settle like dust on parchment,” then “pulse in rhythm”—vehicles shift without cohesion. Final third avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity, but density occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“harbor held its breath,” “lanterns flickered like fireflies”) and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“staggered intervals of storm and calm” borders on redundancy), but no loops or scaffold mar clarity. Sentence openings vary, and paragraphs breathe with visual rhythm. The final line’s cadence perfectly echoes the opening, creating closure without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “arrows pointing like skeletal fingers”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “ghostly impression shimmering,” “tremor of certainty,” “amber light where voices whispered equations”—figurative density borders on purple without dulling closure. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“She placed… and the ghostly imprint glowed”) verge on paraphrase. Rhythm varies effectively; final paragraph’s cadence resonates without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Opening line (“sea breathed mist into the night”) establishes voice and stakes; final line (“quiet resonance that would echo whenever someone entered”) recharges motifs. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“entangled memories that the ocean and the sky had woven together”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors mar peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally, though one adjacent paraphrase (“sculpt space for reflection” / “carve a quiet alcove”) nudges score down.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but mostly clear; sentences advance atmosphere and causality. However, figurative language occasionally overloads (“magnetic fields wrapped like a lover’s sigh,” “spatial mutiny,” “prismatic echoes”) without payoff, risking purple prose. Minor scaffold in “he realized… he wondered… he sensed” sequence dulls immediacy. Final third avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “grief would breach the veil” conveys setting, stakes, and method in one phrase. Sentence openings vary (“In the corner…”, “Outside…”, “When the fog…”); paragraph lengths shift with tension. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“veins of gold,” “wind from another shore”) risks purple prose but pays off thematically. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final sentence (“twin vessels for change”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield (e.g., “trunks twisted like whispered verses, each leaf a careful inkstroke”). Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“textures of different times, to press them like pressed leaves”), risking slight redundancy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Figurative language is coherent—refraction, light, ink, and hum form a stable metaphor system. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its quiet crescendo without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “corrugated metal, smooth like polished glass” conveys texture and thematic contrast). Figurative language is controlled—sepia filter, ghostly murals—and coheres physically. Minor redundancy in “collect fragments... stitch them together... layering” slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes theme without overwriting; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet controlled, with high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. However, adjacent paraphrase loops appear: “the hum vibrated through the cello’s strings… each vibration spelling…” and later “heard the story flow through resonant hums… each vibration spelling…”—redundant phrasing dulls momentum slightly. Also, “resonant hums” repeats four times in climactic section, bordering on scaffold. No clarity loss at closure, but these artifacts prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “hulls beneath the booths creaked in rhythm with the tide” merges setting, sound, and metaphor). Figurative language is pattern-taught (carnival as circus, resistance as encoded art) and pays off in the phoenix. One paraphrase loop: “hopeful desperation that rose like steam” echoes later as “hopeful desperation that felt like a tide turning back.” Otherwise, syntax varies, verbs are strong (“lashed,” “sprayed,” “reorganize”), and closure line resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “copper coils, designed for timed chemical reactions” conveys tool, purpose, and era). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“ghost of the nightwatch itself”), slightly muddying clarity. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “breath of the world before sunrise” verges on cliché. Closure beat remains sharp despite one ornamental phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: metaphors (“anchor… massive iron claw,” “mist… tiny prisms”) serve character perception, not decoration. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“shimmering beams traced delicate patterns that mimicked… flight path”), slightly slowing momentum, but peak beats remain clear. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image is sharp, though one adjacent sentence pair verges on paraphrase (“sealed the tear… as seamlessly as a bird’s feather mends”).

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“dog-ear curled like a tired ear,” “air tasted of iron and old promises”). Figurative language is coherent—condensation as script, ice as silence—and avoids purple excess. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“world tilt as the glass became a portal”) slightly muddles causality, but closure remains sharp. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop (“convergence… singular convergence”) triggers a −0.4 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. However, adjacent lines occasionally verge on paraphrase (“stones sliding into place, timber aligning” / “cracked column as though tuning a great bell”). Figurative language is consistent but pervasive; in high-pressure beats (e.g., fork touching dust), metaphor density risks overwhelming clarity. Final paragraph’s “laughter weaving into rhythm” slightly abstracts what earlier lines rendered concretely. Still, rhythm varies skillfully, and closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (“kelp-draped pillars,” “bioluminescent fish surged”). Sentence variety supports emotional arc. However, minor overwriting occurs: “unsnael” appears four times with diminishing returns, and “gathered hush” verges on repetitive motif-churning. No fatal artifacts, but slight density bloat in the climax dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in peak beats: “copperlight repose” repeats four times, diluting its charge; “scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades” appears verbatim twice, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high but coherent—light/shadow, lattice/prayer motifs sustain logic. However, template cadence emerges (“He stepped… He followed… He reached…”) and “sustains impossibilities” reads as label-speak without embodied demonstration, dulling climax impact.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with imagery but avoids overwriting; most sentences multitask (e.g., “her veil a whisper of ash that clung to her shoulders as if grieving the sun itself” conveys character, setting, and emotion). Minor redundancy appears in phrases like “mournful elation” repeated near start and end, and “resonant awakening” used thrice with slight variation—triggering a −0.3 loop penalty. Still, rhythm varies skillfully, and the final lines land with clean propulsion. No scaffold or muddle obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but overwrought: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff, creating density without propulsion. Mixed metaphors (“loom humming like distant tide,” “stitching hope along the cracks,” “seams of memory”) blur coherence, and repetitive stems (“each… each… each”) induce syntactic monotony. The closure beat suffers from scaffold phrasing (“a testament to a weaver who dared to dream”) that summarizes rather than crystallizes. While rhythm varies, overwriting dulls emotional precision in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“pale rivers of memory,” “lullaby of renewal”) risks figurative saturation but remains coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure beat is clean, though “quiet gratitude of the bones” slightly anthropomorphizes after earlier restraint, creating a faint tonal wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“neon signs flickered like distant memories while machines whispered promises of tomorrow”) that advance atmosphere, character, and theme. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with ritual cadence, and rhythm accelerates toward dispatch. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“lattice of light,” “pulse of encoded hope”), but metaphors remain coherent within the established logic. No loops or scaffold; every image serves the accumulative drive. Final line resonates without redundancy, though one or two modifiers edge toward purple (“crisp logic of code”).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sky bruised with dying stars,” “echoed silence that pressed on ears,” “threads crossing like conspiratorial lines” all advance atmosphere and theme without overwriting. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the embroiderer’s work. One minor flaw: “adjacent possibilities” appears three times with slight synonym churn, risking template cadence, but never in peak beats. Final line (“truth could be sewn”) perfectly recharges the core motif.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—most lines multitask (e.g., “roots intertwined like whispered verses” establishes setting, tone, and metaphor). Figurative language is consistent (water/voice motifs) without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “fierce tenderness” appears thrice, bordering on label-speak. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Closure image (“golden hue” shard) avoids redundancy while echoing moonlight motif.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often doing triple duty (e.g., mist as atmosphere, emotion, and collective memory), but overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “twilight mist deepening into a dream-like veil that wrapped the translator in a lotus-hearted ache” stacks metaphors without clarifying causality. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“unknotting the fear-laden knots,” “unknot the tangled narratives”). Sentence openings vary well, yet the final paragraph’s cadence leans on repetitive structure (“each whispered story… each unknotting…”), dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density (“exposed film of ancient pigment hovered just beneath its cracked surface” conveys object, history, and mystery in one phrase). However, figurative density occasionally borders on overwriting—e.g., “orchard breathed, its fog thinning into a soft sunrise”—where metaphor slightly obscures causality. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“luminous stories,” “luminous optimism”; “pensive mirth” repeated four times), creating slight redundancy. Still, rhythm supports emotional arc, and closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound as colored ribbons, awakenings as Russian dolls) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“cascade of miniature auroras that painted the garden walls… nested awakening within each brushstroke”) edges toward density without muddle, but avoids purple prose. Final paragraph’s momentum falters slightly with repetitive “ripple” imagery, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“seeds spilling like tiny drums,” “kaleidoscope of fragrant, humming possibilities”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match scene needs. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “warped the ambient air into a low-pitched chant that only the Loom's initiates could hear” edges toward explanatory redundancy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one instance of near-synonym stacking (“converging chaos… storm of colors and scents that threatened to dissolve order”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is dense yet coherent: metaphors (“sorrow like slow-growing coral,” “verses as leaves that drank moonlight”) build a unified texture. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“luminescence that felt both tender and triumphant”), but no loops or scaffold mar clarity. Final line (“blooming eternally within the heart of the shell”) perfectly echoes the opening, creating resonant propulsion without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“clouds swirled like parchment,” “translucent organ”), but occasional overwriting appears: “foxglove regret” and “violet sorrow” risk label-speak, though they’re grounded in sensation. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary. One minor artifact: “gently systematic” repeats as descriptor rather than demonstrated constraint. Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative density in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: metaphors (“ink shimmered like sunrise”) serve theme. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats—e.g., “fragile chord that pulsed like a heartbeat” borders on mixed vehicle (sound + biology). No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences use “promise” repetitively (lines 12–14), slightly dulling immediacy. Final paragraph’s “soft symphony swelled” risks abstraction, yet “beacon for future seekers” grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“rusted links singing a low hymn of measurements once taken over seas now forgotten” conveys history, sound, and decay). Figurative language is coherent—stone “breath,” water “lullaby,” ash as “notes”—all reinforcing the sonic/textural motif. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“encrypted compassion pulse through her fingertips, a quiet revelation…”) borders on label-speak but is redeemed by immediate action. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line’s “sapphire thread” crystallizes theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative, with strong verbs (“cascade,” “interwove,” “bloom”) and sensory specificity. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “luminous whirl,” “otherworldly chorus,” and “withering grace” verge on stacked modifiers. A paraphrase loop occurs in “paper trails grew dense… labyrinthine network… intertwined,” slightly dulling momentum. No scaffold or template cadence, but figurative density occasionally edges close to muddle without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“fractured hush,” “necessary distances”) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“whispered of storms past… memory of the wind”) borders on ornamental but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush and musical but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “luminous respite that felt like a breath held in amber” and “shadowseam wonder” verge on self-conscious ornamentation. Some adjacent lines paraphrase (“shared exhale,” “held this shared exhale of wonder”) creating minor loops. Figurative density is high throughout, including in peak beats, slightly blurring causal clarity. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and key images land with precision—especially the feather’s ash igniting constellations.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“cracked pillars… bearing a fragment… missing its ending”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (emotion→color→sound) and payoff-rich (amber glow = longing; rose sigh = warm melancholy). Minor overwriting in “kaleidoscopic shadows… light seemed to weep and smile” risks purple prose, but cohesion holds. Zero loops or scaffolds; syntax varies naturally. Final line’s “hopeful sorrow” crystallizes tone without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “neon ribbons flickered, casting patterned shadows that danced around the chess pieces” does triple duty—setting, motion, metaphor. Minor overwriting in “inked clouds” and “marble pattern into shards” slightly muddles imagery, but not enough to obscure closure. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the tide’s retreat—controlled deceleration that enhances emotional landing.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“The tide dancer moved…”, “She claimed…”, “Night deepened…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “obsidian grace” used twice, once redundantly—and the phrase “fragments of the night itself” edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density occasionally borders on ornamental (“velvety black that seemed to swallow time itself”). Clarity remains intact, but hairline artifacts prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally tipping into overwriting: “prismatic shards across the mist, each fragment catching a fragment of sunrise” verges on recursive ornament. Some paraphrase loops exist (“read between lines” appears three times with diminishing variation), and “clear complexity” is repeated as a near-tautology. Yet rhythm varies effectively, sentence openings diversify, and images propel atmosphere. The final paragraph’s momentum sags slightly under accumulated abstractions (“noctilucent reckonings,” “ordinary lines of tomorrow”), but clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but figurative language occasionally overwhelms propulsion—e.g., “stars twirling in patient arcs that seemed to echo the beats of her own heart” risks mixed metaphor (twirling vs. beats). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: “a promise she had traded for the lives... Now she walked not to rescue but to enlighten” borders on paraphrase-loop. However, information density is high, sentence openings vary, and the final paragraph avoids purple prose. Closure image remains clear despite lyrical intensity, though one or two mid-story metaphors flirt with opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but controlled; most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot. High information density: “reflected light turned the air into a kaleidoscope of potential” merges setting, theme, and action. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “quiet throb of shared ambition” edges into abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines near the end (“decorating them with luminous ribbons… turning the entire coast into a living textbook”) verge on paraphrase. Still, rhythm and clarity hold through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “pages curled like wilted leaves,” “echo faded and where it lingered like a sigh trapped in stone.” Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (sound as visual shadow, stone as dreamer). Minor overwriting in one beat (“swirling ivy and shifting light”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t dull closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm supports accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense with figurative language—often beautiful—but occasionally overwrought (“stone air,” “choir of tiny glass singers”). While rhythm generally supports mood, some sentences stack modifiers (“graceful strokes he painted air itself, each line a secret phrase woven through coded lullabies…”), risking purple prose. No major loops or scaffolds, but the high metaphor density in peak beats slightly obscures causality. Final image remains clear despite textual richness.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: “fire's amber glow fighting against the silver hush” conveys conflict, tone, and setting in one phrase. Minor overwriting in peak beats—“fragile magnificence of humanity’s attempt”—edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. One slight redundancy: “muster the courage to turn ritual into resolution” and later “muster compassion” reuse “muster,” though with evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (map/veins/cracks motif) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“sound like a thousand whispered wings” borders on purple), but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Final line (“carve a song from silence”) recharges the core tension with elegant concision.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: metaphors like “threads of the sanctuary’s magic were woven like delicate cobwebs” verge on mixed imagery (threads vs. cobwebs), and phrases such as “harvest of echoes” repeat without deepening. Sentence openings vary well, and information density is high, yet some lines stack modifiers (“a cascade of light, the harvest of echoes spilling into the winter sky”) that blur propulsion. No fatal loops, but minor figurative muddle in peak beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “meteor hush” conveys aftermath, silence, transience). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“rag-doll marionettes to act out ancient fables with modern moral twists”) slightly bloats, but figurative language remains coherent—no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One near-paraphrase (“half-lit epiphany” repeated) costs 0.3, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “blushing stillness,” “interrupted cadence,” and “transiently rooted” recur with near-synonym variation, risking scaffold loops. The final third leans heavily on figurative language (“knot of light,” “dewy poetry,” “quiet anthem”) without grounding in new action, slightly dulling propulsion. However, sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and information density remains high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. No clarity breaks, but the lyric intensity borders on self-referential in the closing stanzas, warranting a modest artifact deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled (“silver serpent,” “snowmelt ardor”) and coherent. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“choir of lives once thought lost”) slightly dilutes propulsion. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Final paragraph’s lyricism enhances rather than obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“The trail was not merely a route but a sentient filament…”) and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“luminous stream that rose above the trees” borders on purple). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one minor redundancy: “decaying directive” repeated without added pressure. Final paragraph’s rhythm modulates effectively, and the last line (“ready to welcome the next dream‑guided traveler”) resonates without summarizing. Figurative coherence holds—vines, light, sound motifs remain logically consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured: “universe’s tight ledger,” “spirals of possibility,” and “cosmic ledger” verge on repetitive metaphor. Minor scaffold in mid-section (“hoping the diagrams would coax…”) slightly slows momentum. Yet high information density prevails—most lines advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Final paragraph avoids redundancy, and the “gentle click” closure beat lands with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“In the vaulted heart…”, “She had spent years…”, “At the center…”), and paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“resonated within his fingertips” / “vibration traveled through Kovan’s skin”) and the phrase “shifting grace” repeats four times with diminishing returns. No scaffold loops, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax, risking density overload without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is cohesive—fog as silver ribbons, sextant singing, frost as crystal facets—without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“glass‑mountain tone of silence”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly echoes the story’s breath-cycle structure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (light as choir, fractures as seeds) and never contradictory. Minor overwriting in “bruised with storm clouds” and “dripping onto the child’s mind,” but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths modulate rhythm, and the final line resonates without redundancy. Closure beat is artifact-free and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“pond of starlight,” “cracked shells mosaic”) and avoids paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional rhythm, and information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“whispers of futures that had already happened”) borders on abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure. No syntactic monotony or filter-verb stacks; momentum sustains through poetic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (symphony, vines, gaps) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“humming an unheard symphony of forgotten tongues” followed by “unheard symphony of the store”)—a slight redundancy that borders on paraphrase-loop. Otherwise, rhythm varies skillfully, paragraph cuts breathe with discovery, and the final line lands with earned lyricism. No scaffold or artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“rusted chains of light,” “lighthouse born of ink”), but pattern-taught and paid off. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each image advances atmosphere or theme. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor deduction for mixed metaphor logic: “river of ink, flowing backward” contradicts physical behavior without prior world-cue, slightly muddling the climax’s mechanics. Otherwise, high information density with lyrical propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“copper-glinting strands,” “bright filament of golden light”), and sentences vary rhythmically. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “faint hum of latent enchantment awaken beneath her fingertips” edges toward ornamental density. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one or two stacked modifiers (“centuries-old ceremonial rope”) slightly blur immediacy. Still, line-level craft sustains momentum and clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (resonance, luminosity, fracture) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“luminous bodies rippling like living auroras… shaking the calm”) edges toward purple, but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Final paragraph’s rhythm enacts the “steady lull” it describes—a masterful read-aloud cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “shard of hush” conveys concept, object, and atmosphere in three words. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“invisible lines that converge on the beacon… whispering directions”) edges toward redundancy. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (thistle, hum, light). Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“vowed to map each star path”), but closure image redeems momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting dilutes peak beats: “stormlit hall seemed to inhale the clouds” and “heart sang along, feeling grief and joy in equal measure” verge on purple. No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences begin with “He…” during climax, creating slight cadence drag. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme—and closure image (“shadows remained… quiet testament”) is crystalline. Figurative coherence holds despite poetic risk.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“petals catching amber light” conveys time, mood, and perception), but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion—e.g., “fireflies” simile slightly redundant after “sparks filtered through the night.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “blooming fortress” repeats more than necessary. Final third avoids artifacts, and rhythm supports the Accumulative build. Minor deduction for two adjacent sentences restating the fortress’s response to chants.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“She placed…”, “From that point…”, “All the while…”), avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“woven silk,” “metallic trill”) borders on excess but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffolding; every image ties back to the core metaphor. Final line (“ready to chronicle the next ripple”) perfectly echoes the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“his breath echoing off stone like a trapped sigh” establishes setting, character, and mood). Figurative language is coherent—silences have “flavors,” filaments “sing”—without mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “sour bite of a market’s final bell, the sweet aftertaste of rain on stone, the bitter quiet of a forgotten prayer” leans slightly into cataloguing, but rhythm supports accumulation. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the terrace was built from translucent stones that sang with wind, each note a reminder of the world in transit”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats—e.g., “the silence swelled” followed by “droplet a tiny bell ringing without sound” risks mixed metaphor. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density borders on excess in the silver-droplet passage. Still, rhythm varies naturally, and every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line lands with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is richly textured but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “nostalgic reminder of forgotten futures” and “histories tug at her sleeves” verge on abstraction. Figurative density is high, especially in climactic beats, risking slight muddle (e.g., “bridge of fire” lacks physical grounding). However, rhythm varies effectively, sentences advance atmosphere and plot, and there are no paraphrase loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor register drift in peak moments prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language, but avoids overwriting: metaphors (“stitched darkness,” “veins pulsed”) serve theme and action. Sentence openings vary (“The ashen…”, “Within…”, “He wore…”, “After…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One minor flaw: slight synonym churn in describing the threshold (“fading,” “blurred,” “shimmering”) across adjacent lines, though not enough to dull closure. Final line (“darkness would learn to breathe”) recharges the opening premise with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “phosphorescent spores,” “seam of light thin as a thought,” and “quantum promise embedded in a simple algorithm” do triple duty (atmosphere, concept, character). Minor overwriting in the climax (“kaleidoscope that painted the farm in a shadowseam wonder”) slightly blurs the image, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary (“When the world…”, “She claimed…”, “That night…”), and paragraph cuts align with emotional beats. Register stays consistent—no academic drift—even when discussing quantum concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“eloquently silent” recurs meaningfully) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in “vibrations dancing like ribbons of light” slightly strains physics, but the metaphor serves theme. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One small redundancy: “bridge of intuition” appears three times with diminishing variation. Otherwise, line-level craft is near-flawless, with strong verbs and specific nouns (“vellum scroll wrapped in silk”).

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “every step stretched the night like a canvas awaiting a painter’s breath” borders on mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines (“bending shadows into elongated ribbons… turning the endless night into a symphony”), risking paraphrase-loop. However, rhythm modulates with scene needs, and key beats avoid filter verbs or redundancy. Closure image remains sharp despite density, though one or two high-pressure beats flirt with figurative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: metaphors like “dust unfurling like a silent flag” and “pulse of empathy” risk purple edges, though most images earn their weight through recurrence. A paraphrase loop appears in “fragile illustration she rescued from oblivion” echoing earlier “rescued” logic. Sentence variety sustains momentum, but the final paragraph’s cadence (“button shining softly… promise… voice”) flirts with sentimentality that slightly dulls the closure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but largely precise—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative density is high yet pattern-taught: water-as-memory recurs with evolving function. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“reflected map faded, but its lessons remained etched”; “freedom was not a shout but a coded ripple”)—minor loop artifacts. No scaffold or synonym churn, but the phrase “quiet persistence of coded freedom” in the penultimate line edges toward thematic echo, slightly dulling the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“quietly vivid hymn that swirled with memories of forgotten festivals”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences repeat “vested hush” without added pressure. Figurative coherence holds—mist, light, and sound interweave logically—and the final dewdrop image crystallizes impermanence without strain. Momentum never stalls; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly crafted, with strong verbs (“cradling,” “prod-ed,” “ignited”) and purposeful figurative language. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “mossy delight of centuries-old bark” borders on label-speak, and “luminous script across the ground” risks abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the climax (“She filled her brass vial… knowing that the mixture would amplify…”) lean toward explanatory telling. Still, momentum holds, and the final paragraph’s mist image redeems with concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“leaves swirled faster, as if applauding her resolve”). Figurative language is purposeful—“sky bore a bruise of twilight”—and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold in “pattern of coincidences… had aligned just when coincidence becomes pattern” slightly paraphrases, but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with rhythm, and information density remains high without purple excess. Final line’s “swirl of hidden currents” recharges opening’s “hummed with damp air” without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-functional lines (“the crack catching a glint of amber light that seemed to pulse with the rhythm of the storm” advances atmosphere, stakes, and character). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “luminous regret that had settled in her heart… now glowed with purpose” edges toward label-speak, though quickly grounded in action. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One near-mixed metaphor (“sunrise caught in a river of steel”) works due to established metal/liquid imagery, but slightly muddles the vehicle. Otherwise, high propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the gorge swallowed shadows while a lone harp… sang distorted notes that trembled the water”) and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—“fragile thread of pain that shimmered like sunrise glass” risks mixed metaphor—but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image remains sharp despite figurative richness.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“ultraviolet fire,” “lattice of bruised memories”), but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the amber-softened finale. A few adjacent lines verge on paraphrase (“braced herself… braced again”), and “rhythm could be transmuted into kindness” leans abstract. Still, information density is high, sentences propel momentum, and the final paragraph’s cadence resolves with earned warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“glass cold yet humming with a pulse that seems both present and forever delayed”) and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—“eternal instant captured in a drop of light” edges toward abstraction—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line resonates without redundancy, though one or two metaphors (“constellation of stories”) flirt with convention.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shattered marquee flapped like a tired animal” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (cracks as pathways, dust as traffic routes) and pays off. Minor overwriting in “tremulous glow that seemed to coax the dust motes into a slow, spiraling dance”—“seemed” weakens immediacy. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line’s rhythmic closure (“ticking heart she now carried”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “ink-stained fingertips traced hidden codes on vellum” conveys profession, secrecy, and tactile detail). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“rustling awakenings were not merely sounds but the pulse of a world renegotiating its own rules”) edges toward abstraction but recovers quickly. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere within established physics of this world. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with imagery but avoids purple overload; most figurative language serves momentum (“sky into a cascade of silver rain”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“burnished sorrow that seemed to mourn both loss and potential”) edges toward label-speak, slightly dulling immediacy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary effectively. Final paragraph’s rhythm breathes with thematic closure. One near-redundancy (“resilience and rebirth” after “rise, fall, and rebirth”) costs 0.3—but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful—figurative language serves accumulation (“rust behaved like a garden of iron vines”) without muddling causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with action. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“silver threads through the rust, binding the covenant anew”) edges toward density overload, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight through prior patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful; figurative language accumulates meaning (e.g., “liquid glass,” “petrified guardians”). However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “fragments of a memory that did not belong to any living mind” edges toward abstraction, and “sigh of ancient tectonic plates” risks mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“The vibration grew into a chorus, each note a whispered secret…”) verge on paraphrase. Still, propulsion remains strong, and closure image is undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“palms still smelling of salt and pine” conveys setting, character, memory), but occasional overwriting appears: “weathered throat, breathing wind” followed by “turbine-hum reverie” risks mixed registers. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“reimagine… reimagine”; “layered meanings… layered tableau”). Final third avoids artifacts, but figurative density in mid-story slightly blurs propulsion. Still, rhythm supports pressure, and closure line (“the lantern waits, ready to shine again”) resonates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“rivulets that glittered like silver threads,” “frozen waterfall” of stained glass), and nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “phosphorescent rhythm that matched her heartbeat” edges toward cliché, and “collective memory embedded in the postcards” risks abstraction. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight, though “world exhaled a gentle sigh” flirts with personification excess. Still, propulsion remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “kelp remnants, shattered shells, and sea-glass shards” advances setting, character, and plot. Figurative language is consistent—light, flame, hum—and avoids mixed metaphors. Slight overwriting in “searing reverie” repeated twice borders on scaffold, but not enough to obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, and the final line (“new covenant”) resonates without summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“skeleton of boarded windows,” “fountain… of light, each beam a memory of a child’s laugh”), though occasional overwriting appears (“fragile glass of remembered desire” borders on abstraction). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor paraphrase-loop in describing the town’s revival (“reassembled… refilled… lit up”) slightly dulls momentum. No scaffold or register drift, but one mixed metaphor (“sealed its fate in amber” then “bottle with no opening”) creates slight dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “velvet disquiet,” “wax cylinder phonograph shaving,” “stone roots” all do multiple jobs. Figurative language is coherent—sound “unfurls,” tone “curls,” prophecy “settles like dew”—no mixed metaphors. Minor redundancy in “ancient perfume… dead languages he could still speak” slightly dulls opening, but no loops or scaffold in closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“shards of time like crystal snowflakes that settled on the phoenix's wings”), yet avoids overwriting. Figurative coherence holds—frost/flame/knitting metaphors interlock logically. One paraphrase loop: “furiously tranquil” repeated without progression. Final third’s “texture of borrowed time” refrain edges toward scaffold, slightly dulling closure’s freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “silver strand interwoven with conductive filaments” conveys tech and texture in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“retired hymn,” “heartbeats of the sky”) and pays off in closure’s “lullaby.” Minor redundancy in “microclimate variations” (lines 12/28) slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence (“spiraled like a vortex… promise… rebellion”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “flourishing stillness” and “spiritually curious mind” border on label-speak, and adjacent sentences sometimes paraphrase (“each trajectory became a story… each star’s fall a lesson”). Yet rhythm varies skillfully, sentence openings diversify, and information density is high. Figurative coherence holds—lantern as captured sunrise, star paths as threads—though “polished by invisible hands” risks mixed metaphor. Closure beat remains clear despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “wind rose, it carried a whisper of forgotten hymns” does triple duty. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“kaleidoscope of colors, each shard carrying a fragment…”) risks purple prose but avoids muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s “molten amber tear” lands with clarity and propulsion—zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied syntax, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence earns its place. Minor overwriting appears in “shimmering with stories yet untold” and “sky stitched with constellations made of silver sand”—beautiful but bordering on decorative. These don’t obscure causality but slightly dilute propulsion in peak beats, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought—figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, risking density overload. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“harmonizing discord” repeated verbatim; “woven dawns” used four times with diminishing returns). The phrase “warmly attentive” recurs as a label rather than embodied action. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and the final image lands with clarity despite ornamental tendencies.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “chlorophyll clouds from entwined roots” conveys biology, atmosphere, and theme in one phrase. Sentence openings vary (“Six months had been handed…”, “She moved…”, “Visitors who entered…”), avoiding template cadence. Minor overwriting appears in “interspecies dialogue” and “architectural secrets revealed by compassion”—slightly abstract for peak beats—but doesn’t obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances character, setting, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: “silvered sentinel,” “chemical fingerprint,” “bronze quiet fire” sustain a unified metaphor system. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“artificial pilgrimage that bridged…”, “artificial pilgrimage had reached its apex”), and “luminous skeptic”/“academically rebellious” read as label-stacking. Final third avoids scaffold loops, but “rain intensified… metronome… breathe as one organism” edges toward purple prose. Information density remains strong—most lines advance atmosphere and theme simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: most lines multitask (e.g., “coral skeletons lay like bleached bones” establishes setting, tone, and stakes). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“dry husks unfurled like pale scrolls, each whispering a forgotten promise”) edges toward purple but serves theme. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One near-paraphrase (“narrow vastness” repeated thrice) borders on motif but slightly dilutes final impact—prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“veins glinting like copper in a sun-lit river”), but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion: “wild hush” repeated thrice, “tinted revelations” used abstractly. No paraphrase loops, yet “distance into closeness” borders on refrain-as-scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm falters slightly with stacked clauses. Still, high information density and vivid specificity outweigh minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“sky... smear of violet and ash,” “needles pointing not only outward but also inward”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “temporally stretched into a lingering breath of possibility” risks abstraction, and “universe waited with patient arms” edges toward sentimentality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the climax restate the compass’s alignment with slight variation, dulling propulsion. Information density remains high overall.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“coat of midnight velvet stitched with silver threads that whispered of past heists” establishes character, history, and texture). Figurative language is coherent—ice has “teeth,” clouds “pulse like living ribbons”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“soul expand like a sunrise”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence (“steps light yet deliberate… sacredly playful echo”) perfectly echoes opening, rewarding attention without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“echoes lingered like half‑remembered prayers”) is coherent and recurring. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“benevolently ruthless resolve to protect any fragile truth”) edges toward abstraction, and “nomadic penumbra” risks obscurity, but context clarifies. No loops or scaffold—each image evolves (chessboard → scroll → streets). Deduction for slight register drift in “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing, though not enough to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mercury glass, hidden thunder) and never muddled. Minor overwriting appears in the phrase “wind‑blown pages” (slightly generic), and one adjacent pair (“towering libraries… corridors that smelled”) edges toward paraphrase-loop, but momentum remains unbroken. Final lines achieve lyrical propulsion without sacrificing clarity; the mountain “breathing with her” crystallizes the core metaphor without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “lightning had broken the sky hours before” establishes setting, mood, and temporal paradox). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“frayed like old nerves,” “twisting like a king’s strategy”) and coheres. Minor overwriting in mid-section: “corridors glimmered with reflected thunderclouds” slightly stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly echoes “game well-played.” Closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid but over-dense in high-pressure beats: “shards of secret confession,” “kaleidoscope that seemed to whisper the price,” “refracted truth she had scattered” stack metaphors without propulsion. Some paraphrase loops (“refract,” “bend,” “split” used interchangeably). Final third avoids artifacts, but mid-story figurative saturation risks muddle. Still, rhythm supports accumulation, and key images land.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but figurative language occasionally overloads high-pressure beats (“heart throbbed like a clock-gear,” “narrative grew stronger, a bulwark of purpose,” “quilting memories together”). Minor redundancy appears in “breaths held underwater” repeated twice. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports escalation. However, phrases like “dire enchantment” and “fragile alloy ready to shatter” verge on purple prose, slightly dulling immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“sea’s sighs,” “heartbeat of old ships”) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting appears in the oasis description (“twisted like the brushstrokes of a tempest”), slightly slowing momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar the text. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors tidal ebb, fulfilling the “read-aloud ear test,” though one mixed metaphor (“cascade of tiny painted seashells that glowed like lanterns”) nudges clarity just enough to prevent a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “vibrations of intent rose from the vial like a quiet chord, each pulse gently purifying the air, each note coaxing the garden's scent…” stacks figurative clauses without propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops (“trembling in rhythm with her heart” / “humming vibration… echo his own heartbeat”). Final third avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively overall.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “eyes sewn together from half‑remembered maps” conveys trauma, profession, and vision). Figurative language is pattern-taught (moon phases, patina, hum) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“raw solace: each metallic click… confession of perseverance”) edges toward abstraction, but momentum holds. Final paragraph’s rhythm—breath, ships, lanterns, quiet—resolves with perfect cadence. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts mar clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (“roots hung on sheer cliffs,” “leaf-dust like confetti”). Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“broken cathedral of fruit… brine and old sorrow”) risks figurative clutter, but pattern pays off at closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. One register drift (“psychological safety”) slightly jars the fungal lexicon but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exquisite: high information density (“coat frayed like old sea rope” conveys age, profession, and wear in six words), varied sentence openings, and rhythmic propulsion that breathes with the tide. Figurative language is cohesive—no mixed metaphors—and elevated diction (“nautical twilight,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied) fits Marlowe’s contemplative POV. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “softly persistent” (repeated verbatim), which edges toward label-like emphasis rather than fresh embodiment in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; figurative language serves propulsion (“creek rose to a roar,” “doorway shimmering with possibilities”). Minor overwriting in midsection (“brass teeth etched with letters that seemed to rearrange themselves”) borders on density overload, but never muddles causality. Sentence variety sustains momentum, and the final paragraph’s cadence mirrors water-drip rhythm. One paraphrase loop (“glow… glimmer… glimmer”) slightly dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: “bleeding starlight” appears four times with diminishing returns, and metaphors like “lacy menace” or “silk ribbons stained with dark ink” verge on mixed registers. A paraphrase loop occurs: “dissolved like mist at sunrise” / “dissolved like frost at sunrise.” Final third contains elevated diction (“tempered by starlight”) that borders on label-speak. Despite high information density, figurative saturation slightly dulls the climax’s emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery but occasionally over-ornamented (“powdered moonstone, crushed carnelian, and a whisper of sunrise” risks stacked modifiers). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary effectively. One minor register drift: “density of presence” leans abstract amid otherwise concrete language. Closure beat remains clear, though figurative density slightly slows momentum in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “letters rearrange themselves as if jealous of the past selves”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“feral echo of nostalgia that makes my heart ache and smile simultaneously”) edges toward abstraction, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “wind carve new stories into my skin” slightly strains physical logic. Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally over-ornamented (“cryptic tableau,” “emotional topography”). Most lines multitask—describing fog while advancing theme, depicting action while embodying emotion. Minor redundancy in “trembling calm” appearing twice, and slight metaphor stacking in the climax (“conduit for love's first sigh” + “quiet tear shedding light”), but clarity never falters. Final paragraph propels momentum to earned closure without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but propulsive, with high information-per-line: “crystallizes when stressed, turning pressure into tiny glass shards that sang with the wind” does triple duty. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “saturated hush that wrapped every stone and leaf” followed by near-redundant “saturated hush that promised more breaths”—triggering slight paraphrase-loop friction. Yet rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings diversify, and closure image (“wind carrying the scent of jasmine and the echo of her grandmother’s chant”) lands with clean resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly precise, with high information density (e.g., “induced currents pulsed… turning sheet music into a living map of regret”). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity: “gritty, ethereal chorus,” “cracked saint,” and “smoky incense” risk mixed registers. No paraphrase loops, but minor scaffold in “imperfect miracle” repetition slightly dulls the final beat. Read-aloud rhythm remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “tangled narratives of creation be harmonized” verge on abstraction, and metaphors accumulate without always clarifying (“constellations that the universe had stitched together during its restless dreaming”). Minor scaffold appears in repetitive structures (“each… each…”), and “resounding hush” recurs four times—effective as motif but bordering on incantatory redundancy. Final paragraph maintains propulsion, though “vanished like a breath of wind” edges toward cliché. Overall, high information density with only slight momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“shoulders humming with the pulse of water‑driven gears” conveys setting, character, and sound). Figurative language is coherent—water as breath, gears as heartbeat—and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in “amber and steel” blur, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with the ritual. Final line’s rhythm echoes the discovered cadence, closing the sonic loop cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled—“pulse like soft lanterns,” “quiet wildfire”—and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy in “permeable barriers” repetition and slight overuse of “quiet wildfire” (three times) nudges down from 9+. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies naturally, especially in the storm sequence’s urgent cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“casting a prism of shadows that made the rows of books seem like veins of possibility”) and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“phosphorescent symbols… formed a map… each intersection corresponded to a lesson”), slightly slowing momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (light/shadow/veins motif). The final paragraph’s cadence falters slightly with repetitive structure (“She knew… She placed… She wrote… She closed…”), but clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“forgotten vein,” “fireflies trapped in glass”) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “each night thereafter...” paragraph risks slight paraphrase-loop, but propulsion remains strong. Final lines avoid redundancy, landing with resonant compression. No register drift or syntactic monotony; read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often exquisite (“ink dark as walnut bark,” “jetty sang a mournful hymn”), but suffers from overwriting: “haunted euphoria” appears four times, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls its impact. Figurative density peaks in every sentence of the climax (“luminous memory,” “lanterns in the night’s embrace”), risking purple prose without pattern payoff. The phrase “proximate causes” is repeated mechanically, functioning as jargon rather than organic diction. These artifacts obscure emotional precision in the final third, disqualifying 8.5+ despite strong individual lines.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“laughter like a rusted hinge,” “ivy fell back like curtains”) without muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “polite anarchy defined her approach” edges toward abstraction but is immediately grounded in action. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; information density remains high. Final line resonates by echoing the opening’s ivy motif, closing the textual circuit cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“skin that absorbs languages like a sponge” immediately establishes trait and metaphor). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“river of sound that only she could perceive”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language remains coherent—forest “sings,” notes “crescendo,” light “paints”—all reinforcing the sonic-tactile motif. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight through prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“tangled ribbons of light, each one a contingent relationship…” risks abstraction). Sentence openings vary effectively, and rhythm breathes with scene needs. One paraphrase loop: “unbend the logic… unbent my own expectations” slightly dulls momentum. Figurative coherence holds—comet fragment, garden pruning, tidal gravity—all serve central metaphor. Closure line (“quiet rebellion against the chaos”) resonates without purple excess, though “strange comfort” borders on label-speak if not embodied earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, high information per line, and rhythmic control. Figurative language is coherent (e.g., “silver sigh,” “living stave”) and taught early. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “mournful beauty of creating harmony from absence,” slightly bordering on abstraction, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with the narrative pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “murals spread like lava, bright and tender” merges image and motion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances plot or character. Figurative language is coherent (fire motifs sustain logic). Minor overwriting in “volcanic tenderness” repeated thrice, but payoff justifies recurrence. Final line (“invites strangers to linger and listen”) resolves with resonant image, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with image but rarely overwrought; figurative language serves accumulation (“blossoms into luminous bells,” “funeral veil” of aurora). Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“entangled memories that whispered through the ripples… each ripple sang a note of sorrow”), slightly blurring cause/effect. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but three adjacent sentences beginning with “The…” near climax flirt with template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes—yet momentum dips briefly during descriptive peaks, costing a half-point.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“creases like age-worn veins,” “shadows that danced like the storm’s aurora”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and information density is high—e.g., the map’s glow conveys plot, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Minor deduction: slight overwriting in “faint as a moth’s wing” (cliché adjacent) and “steel veins” (repeated motif). No scaffold, no artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but over-dense: metaphors (“dental mirror held gently against the darkness,” “shutters of water”) repeat without evolving, creating near-loops. “Spiralingly calm” appears three times with diminishing returns. Final paragraph suffers from stacked modifiers (“quiet reminder of the night’s quiet triumph”). High information density is offset by occasional purple prose that dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies skillfully, though occasional overwriting appears (“dust danced like quiet fireflies,” “magnetic grotto under starlight”)—figurative density slightly exceeds pressure needs in early beats. No loops or scaffolding; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final lines avoid summary, resolving through image. Minor deduction for two adjacent metaphors in opening that border on ornamental, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“seafoam clung to stone,” “salt that smelled of freedom”) and varied syntax. However, figurative language occasionally overloads high-pressure beats (e.g., “note rise like a blade” followed by “veil that hid the island”), risking coherence. No loops or scaffold, but minor register drift in “combative tenderness” edges toward label-speak. Final paragraph maintains propulsion and clarity despite elevated diction.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “silence stitched from broken songs”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “fragrant as well as heavy” and “quiet cultivation of lightness” verge on abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines summarize similar ideas (“carving light from sorrow… leaving the world less empty”). Figurative coherence holds; metaphors (snow, theater, hymn) align with established logic. Closure image remains sharp despite slight inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense, musical, and largely free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“lantern-moth hush” recurs meaningfully) and coherent (ice/sky, sound/thread, quartz/hum). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“watercolor of doubts and dreams” borders on abstraction), but no muddled metaphors or register drift. Final lines land with clarity and propulsion; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose achieves high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but occasional overwriting dulls peak beats. Phrases like “bruised with orange and violet” or “metallic sighs echoing the rhythm of Selene’s brush” verge on stacked modifiers, risking purple prose. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences mar momentum, yet the final third’s density (“garden of glass flowers sprouted, each reflecting a fragment...”) slightly obscures causality between ivy/lotus contact and glass bloom. Still, rhythm varies purposefully, and concrete verbs (“coaxed,” “stitch,” “humming”) anchor abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density: “fractured the golden shadows into a spectrum of audible ribbons” merges visual and sonic. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“synaptic sparks,” “amber drop slipping into the mind’s void”), risking figurative saturation, but coherence holds. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure image (“reverberations of what had been learned”) avoids summary, trusting resonance. One near-paraphrase (“texture of connection” repeated) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“wind whispering through brass lenses and ancient maps” establishes setting, mood, and history), though occasional overwriting appears (“curtain of intention that could be pulled to reveal hidden light” borders on mixed metaphor). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary effectively. Final paragraph’s “fold waiting to be opened” elegantly echoes origami motif without redundancy. Minor figurative density in mid-story slightly dulls propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (tape as “conduit,” crash as “shattered glass”) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“arteries of commerce pulsing beneath rain-kissed rooftops”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence variety supports cadence; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Closure image (“single clear droplet”) is crystalline, with zero artifacts obscuring cost or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“walls themselves breathed a sigh of anguished joy” conveys setting, tone, and theme). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“cascade of light descended like liquid memory”), risking figurative density, but clarity remains intact. No loops or scaffold; every image serves momentum or closure. A single mixed metaphor (“atoms of nostalgia coalesce… vortex”) slightly muddles physics but doesn’t obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“his eyes, sharp as dusk, caught the faint outline...”) and rhythmic variation. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “softly deliberate” repeats as label and descriptor, and “luminous regret” borders on diagnostic abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences near the climax restate the stone’s glow slightly redundantly. These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ eligibility per Q7 guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“tail tip... trembling comet,” “shimmering stillness”—but avoids overwriting through rhythmic variation and concrete verbs. Sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. One paraphrase loop: “fragile convictions wobble... tremor become a blaze” followed by “convictions steadier... anchored” risks redundancy. Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, though “quietly vivid resolve” echoes earlier phrasing without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language, though occasionally risks overwriting (“meteor hush” appears three times, verging on motif fatigue). Sentence openings vary effectively; paragraph cuts serve rhythmic and emotional pacing. One minor paraphrase loop: “displaced miracle” described twice in close succession with near-identical phrasing. Overall, high information density and propulsion, but slight figurative repetition in peak beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but figurative language occasionally overwhelms propulsion: “dust... like slow snow,” “labyrinth of rooms that folded,” “river of memory” appear in quick succession during high-pressure beats, risking purple prose. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, yet mixed metaphors (“cartographer mapping invisible continents” vs. “letters as tiny birds”) slightly blur coherence. Final paragraph’s momentum falters with stacked clauses, though the last line (“carrying... like a lantern”) redeems clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: metaphors like “constellations that pulsed like quiet hearts” and “shadowed rapture wrapped his senses” verge on purple in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“unspoken words… verses that never reached sunrise… unvoiced poems”), and elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “conceptual repricing” implied in tone) occasionally drifts from plausible dreamer lexicon. Yet rhythm varies skillfully, information density is high, and the final lines land with clarity. Artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line: “petals of sand shimmering with soft violet hue” conveys color, texture, and unnatural beauty in one phrase. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“lattice of wave functions that could charm the very fabric of existence”)—slightly abstract for the otherwise concrete lexicon—but doesn’t obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s rhythm masterfully echoes the “fractured lullaby” motif through syntactic variation, fulfilling the read-aloud test.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled; high information density (e.g., “pistoned moss,” “amber veins”) advances atmosphere and theme simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, figurative density occasionally borders on overload—e.g., “hum of insight thrummed beneath the canopy… promising probable miracles” followed immediately by “rusted trunk sang the sound of wind…” risks stacking metaphors without breath. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“He realized his motivation… was not a quest… but a reclamation”) verge on restatement. Final third remains clear, so no artifact cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “lantern glowed like a lullaby” and “darkness to part like a gentle tide” verge on mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold in “gentle pressure of the star as if it were a pulse of hope” → later “pulse like a distant bell”—redundant sonic motif. Sentence openings vary well, but “each turn reminded… each stroke a reminder…” shows slight paraphrase loop. High information density overall; every image serves theme or character.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“walls shimmering like bruised sapphire” establishes setting and mood). Figurative language is coherent (snow as “soft footfall,” silence as “unpardonable”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “nerve regeneration experiment that pulsed through the fortress like a slow heartbeat” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“ink spread like a slow tide,” “shelves seemed to melt”) without muddle. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“radiating a presence that felt almost planetary”), but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final line (“turned treachery into dust”) risks slight abstraction but earns it through prior concrete buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Rhythm varies naturally, mirroring oceanic pulses and tapping beats. Minor overwriting in “periodically eternal” (used twice) slightly dilutes its impact, but no loops or scaffold mar clarity. Final paragraph’s “anchored and adrift” crystallizes tone without redundancy, and the closing image lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often doing double duty (e.g., “dust into spirals that glittered like distant galaxies”). However, overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “thunderous serenity” repeats three times, and metaphors stack without pattern-teaching (“rusted cathedral,” “bruised sky,” “secret lens to the cosmos”). A paraphrase loop occurs in the final paragraph (“rebellion, lull, and relentless hum” echoes earlier triads). These artifacts slightly dull the closure image but don’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “frayed but still bearing an indecipherable script” conveys object state, mystery, and hope in one phrase. Figurative language pattern-taught (plants “trembling,” “sang,” “whispers”) pays off in closure chorus. Minor overwriting in “translucent column that hovered”—passive verb slightly dulls propulsion. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“Steam rose…”, “She had discovered…”, “During a night…”).

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “edges frayed like the coastline” merges object and setting; “pearl of stillness” avoids purple prose by grounding metaphor in heartbeat rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “anchor optimism in realism” appears twice, slightly redundant. Figurative language is consistent—no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports emotional arc: short clauses during panic (“She pressed her thumb…”), longer flows in reflection. Final image (“glimmered brighter than any lighthouse”) earns its lyricism through prior buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“hinges split like fractured ribs,” “walls close in, pressing the air into a thin, luminescent ache”—but avoids overwriting through rhythmic variation and concrete anchors. Sentences advance multiple layers (character, setting, theme) without redundancy. Minor flaw: “fractured reality” and “necessary darkness” verge on conceptual abstraction in peak beats, slightly dulling immediacy. Otherwise, high information density, zero loops, and strong propulsion earn near-top marks.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“chrome feathers flickering like liquid mercury,” “sun’s bruised light”), but occasional overwriting risks clarity—e.g., “consciously wild” appears without embodiment, and “fragile tapestry of existence” verges on abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor: ink forms “ghostly tide” then “map,” slightly muddying vehicle. Final paragraph’s cadence is masterful, though “ink of history could no longer disappear” leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “ink still warm… contraband truth”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“thunderous echo of potential rebellion” borders on mixed metaphor), and “bravely conflicted” risks label-speak, though quickly grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; every image serves escalation or closure. Final line’s snowflake-mirror conceit crystallizes theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: “tranquil blaze” appears four times, “engraved quiet” three, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high in every sentence of the climax (“thorns glinting like tiny swords sheathed in moonlight”), bordering on purple. Sentence openings vary, but cadence becomes incantatory, sacrificing propulsion for texture. No scaffold sentences, but synonym churn (“continuity,” “stitch,” “weave”) dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density: “transliterates emotions into currents” conveys character, theme, and world in five words. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“wild, feral lullaby across the mossy stones” – “feral” slightly redundant after “wild”), but no loops or scaffold. Figurative coherence holds; metaphors (sound as water, stars as threads) interlock without contradiction. Final lines propel closure without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (“orbits of regret,” “ink like rain”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “floating thought, solemn yet playful” risks abstraction, but rhythm varies effectively. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure beat (“orbits… began to unwind, one proof at a time”) earns its lyricism through prior logic—though one near-redundancy (“solemn playfulness” appears twice) nudges score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“constellations painted in ash,” “cracks humming in answer”) and varied rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears in peak beats (“haunted firmware embedded in the laboratory’s forgotten recording devices” borders on ornate). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one minor redundancy: “tether the crying infant’s wail to the amber” and later “tether a cry” slightly echo without added pressure. Closure image remains unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “tracing spirals that mirrored the restless thoughts” merges action, setting, and interiority. Figurative coherence—“captured sigh,” “palpable veil”—serves accumulative texture without muddle. Minor overwriting in “emergent hush blossomed, a collective inhalation shared by stone and spirit alike” edges toward abstraction but pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary purposefully (“She knelt...”, “When she lifted...”, “Through the patterns...”).

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“minaret mosaic tessera glimmered… like a wounded beacon”) and strong verbs (“stitched the broken sky,” “pulse beneath their feet”). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without respite, risking overwriting; the phrase “warm coldness” recurs four times, bordering on motif fatigue. No paraphrase loops, but the closing paragraph’s “amber light… living diagram… subtle vibration…” leans toward stacked modifiers. Information density is high, yet momentum occasionally stalls under ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but pattern-taught and payoff-consistent: synesthesia isn’t overused but deployed strategically to mirror emotional escalation. Minor overwriting occurs (“translucent stage beneath the orchard’s canopy, where silhouettes of his past shows flickered like fireflies”)—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the ghost’s song. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Final paragraph’s lyricism sharpens rather than dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (e.g., “opalescent veins catching the studio’s neon ribbons like a compass needle”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, though occasional over-compression (“a surge of electric memory into every circuit and into Mara’s own nervous system”) risks muddle. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent. Deduction for slight purple prose in “sensory dialogue” and “hidden corridor finally revealed.”

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density: “droplets of vapor that rose like lanterns, each bearing a hue that corresponded to the heat-mapping emotions” fuses image, method, and emotion in one clause. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the ritual’s cadence. Minor overwriting in “factually mystical” (redundant given context) and slight abstraction in “hidden grief” slightly dilute peak beats. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or register drift—every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (amber glow, echoes singing) and coheres physically. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“jumbled like scattered buttons on a thrifted table”) edges toward mixed metaphor, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively. Closure beat (“cliffs listened as if hearing themselves”) avoids artifact, though “quiet music of resolved destiny” flirts with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“silver hush” appears four times, sometimes redundantly). Minor paraphrase loops exist—e.g., “fixing what’s broken” and “mended” in adjacent sentences—and the phrase “prudently daring” recurs without deepening. Yet information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Closure image (“heart a steadier compass”) is clear and resonant, though the repeated “silver hush” slightly dulls its uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fog curled like spindrift” conveys motion, texture, and mood). Figurative language is coherent—palimpsest, manuscript, stitch—all serve the core metaphor. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“percolate through every breath,” “dissolving like sugar in rain”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly echoes the earned calm, avoiding purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (light as kindness, timelines as lattice) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “sharp gentleness” risks abstraction, but it’s grounded by context. Sentence variety supports cadence; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Closure beat is artifact-free, with high information density and clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished (“silver ribbons dancing on the tide,” “quivering hush lingered like a breath held”). While figurative density serves the accumulative lens, some phrases verge on redundancy (“fragile offering,” “pragmatic hope had become a living lantern”). No fatal loops or scaffold, but minor overwriting in peak beats prevents 9+; the closure image remains vivid despite slight inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “atomically reflective surface” conveys physics and metaphor). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, though occasional overwriting appears (“fragile ripples of memory, perfect for brittle awakenings”). No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences use “hum” as subject, creating slight cadence drag. Closure image remains sharp despite minor figurative saturation in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rich but controlled; sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. High information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“cascade of silver light… weaving through… spiraling back”) risks figurative overload, but coherence holds. No loops or scaffolding; every image serves the accumulative arc. Final paragraph’s cadence breathes appropriately, closing the prismatic hush with resonant economy.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: “ethereal grit” encapsulates tone, setting, and theme in two words. Figurative language is controlled—static as “canvas,” community anxiety “dissolving”—without purple excess. One paraphrase loop: “cautiously hopeful” appears three times with diminishing returns. Final paragraph’s “whisper that might demand… interference” slightly dilutes momentum after strong closure image. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; rhythm varies effectively across broadcast/static/unity beats.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Sentence openings vary; rhythm mirrors spatial unfolding. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “spatial upheaval” paired with “bittersweet resonance” slightly stacks abstractions. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “quiet rebellion” and “wistful rebellion” in closing paragraphs. Still, clarity remains intact, and the final line (“carrying the mutiny of space within his heart”) lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly precise—each image serves theme or character. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms propulsion: “furrowed hush,” “lance of pigment,” “phantom emotions” verge on stacked modifiers. Minor paraphrase loop in describing the ribbon’s role. Final paragraph’s “methodical lance of compassion” slightly repeats earlier phrasing. Still, rhythm supports mood, and closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain hammered… like a thousand muted drums” establishes rhythm without purple excess. Figurative language is pattern-taught (dread as sponge, syllables as moss) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “reversible exile of her forebear's spirit loosen its bonds” slightly strains metaphor, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Sentence variety supports emotional cadence, especially during the chamber descent.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: metaphors stack (“thread of sunrise,” “veil… unravel,” “network of forgiveness stitched”) without always clarifying causality. Minor paraphrase loops (“luminous disbelief” x3, “trembling map” x2) and template cadence (“He… He… He…”) in final third dull immediacy slightly. Yet rhythm varies effectively, sentences do multiple jobs, and key images propel momentum. Closure image (“wet-plate glowed faintly”) remains clear despite figurative weight—no muddle at the critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “dusky harmony” repetition (used three times) edges toward scaffold, but it’s motif-driven, not looped redundancy. Final paragraph’s “dusky harmony of the early sky echoing his internal rhythm” risks slight abstraction but earns it through prior grounding. No figurative muddle; clarity holds even in lyric passages.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished (“tapestry of variable stars,” “fragrant paper curling like a sigh” appear in high-density succession without functional payoff). Minor paraphrase loops: “burden lift” repeated across paragraphs; “midnight solace” used three times with diminishing returns. Final third avoids scaffold, but figurative density in the middle risks purple prose. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and key lines (“words could heal with words”) earn their weight.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with imagery but maintains propulsion: each sentence advances atmosphere, action, or theme. Figurative language is mostly coherent (vortex as wound, cape as bird, shards as syllables). However, slight overwriting appears in high-pressure beats—e.g., “warlike serenity,” “calm blade poised”—where elevated diction borders on label-speak. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase cluster around “unbend” slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “pliant ribbon” of time, “luminous threads of hope,” “moon metal” verge on stacked modifiers. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“anxious elation rose… rose to a roar”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with the visionary’s pulse. However, high-pressure beats rely on figurative density over concrete action—e.g., “surge of memory flooded her mind” tells rather than dramatizes. Still, momentum holds, and the final lines achieve poetic propulsion without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“skeletal trees,” “ash dissolved into bright thread of amber”) and avoids paraphrase loops. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (e.g., “roots pulling tighter, bones aligning like verses… amber seeped… turning voids into conduits”), risking slight overwriting. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences, and propulsion remains strong. Final paragraph’s rhythm modulates perfectly with thematic resolution, though one or two stacked modifiers (“dusky resolve settle deeper”) flirt with purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly disciplined—high information density, varied sentence openings, strong verbs (“wrested,” “humming,” “conjure”). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “dust rose like a slow sunrise,” “cymbal of possibility,” “valley longing” risk stacking metaphors without grounding. One paraphrase loop: “confidently uncertain” followed by near-redundant descriptions of doubt. Still, rhythm supports mood, and the final paragraph avoids overwriting. No scaffold or template cadence; momentum holds despite minor ornamental flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: most lines advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously (“iron‑kissed leaves humming with static that bent the very light around them”). Figurative language is patterned (whispers, seeds, bridges) without muddle. One paraphrase loop appears: “the seed shimmered… rippling like a pond” followed by “faint glow spread outward”—slightly redundant. Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. The only artifact is mild overwriting in the final paragraph (“ambition, once haunted, could be guided toward compassion”), but it doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (tides, moon, metal, bamboo) without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“fire that does not burn, water that does not drown”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors tidal rhythm. Closure image remains sharp despite lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but figurative language occasionally overwhelms propulsion (“prisms that whispered ancient lullabies,” “vines of light”). Minor scaffold in mid-section (“She moved slowly...”) slows momentum. No paraphrase loops, but some sentences prioritize beauty over beat advancement. Final paragraph risks purple prose (“beacon for any heart that dared to hope”), though rhythm remains controlled. High information density overall, with few wasted lines.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: nearly every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the accordion metaphor. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“raw solace that settled in my chest,” “sky bruised with dusk”) edges toward purple prose but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; however, “daringly methodical” repeats without deepening, and “truth-seeking river chronicler” feels inserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“halos that danced like murmurs of forgotten verses”), but pattern is taught early and sustained. Minor scaffold appears in repetitive phrasing (“cyclically reversed” used four times near-identically) and slight synonym churn (“cautious exuberance” repeated verbatim). No loops or causality-obscuring artifacts; closure image remains clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with imagery but occasionally over-ornamented (“lattice of archives and whispered histories,” “frost-laden chord”). Some adjacent lines verge on paraphrase (“propagate hope by reading the future in coffee stains” / “interpreting the curling shadows as tomorrow's decisions”). Figurative coherence holds, though “transparent strings traced a perforated destiny” strains literal logic. Final paragraph sings, but mid-story sentences sometimes stack modifiers (“amber lamps swayed in the high dome” → fine; “quiet thoughts of the creeping vines” → slightly redundant). Momentum never stalls, but perfection eludes.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language serves accumulation (“aurora’s colors... waiting for permission to fade”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“chorus of low hums and high sighs”) slightly bloats density, but no mixed metaphors or register drift. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts align with emotional beats. Final line (“a single spark could still illuminate the endless dark”) resolves with charged simplicity—no scaffold or loop detected near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“her heart scalloping with a rhythm that mirrored the gentle rolling of vineyard hills”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., “umbral veil shimmered with phosphorescent lichen, a soft glow that reminded her of the vineyard hush she cherished”—slightly redundant). No scaffold or simultaneity errors; sentence openings vary. Closure beat remains clear despite slight figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information-per-line (e.g., “shoulders cloaked in the weight of others' unresolved guilt”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “fragile peace she had helped forge” edges toward abstraction, and “resonant reconfiguration” concepts risk purple prose but are grounded by concrete actions. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. Final paragraph’s gull cry weaving “another layer of nuance” slightly strains metaphor but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (water/stone/magnetism motifs) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“ozone and ancient bark, a sycamore hush that seemed to soften the edges of time itself”) slightly slows momentum, but rhythm recovers for the climax. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “wings cutting the thin air like knives” conveys sound, motion, and metaphor simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere or theme. Minor overwriting in “pulse left wandering between shadow and stone” risks abstraction, but it’s anchored by immediate tactile follow-up (“brushed against her skin”). Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors the story’s cadence—still, echoing, resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“lingering luminance” recurs with evolving meaning) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“painting the world in a brilliant dimness that felt both hopeful and mournful”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final lines achieve resonant concision without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“books lay open on their own, pages turning without wind, each leaf emitting a faint hue…”), advancing atmosphere, character, and concept. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “ribbon of sound that curled into a spiral of violet and amber” borders on stacked modifiers, slightly muddying the image. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Closure image (“teal hue that now lingered on his fingertips”) is clear, concrete, and charged—though one beat risks purple prose without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“rusted dome of forgotten suns,” “ribbon of light to thread through the cracks of time”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats—e.g., “distill the murmurs of the ancient metal” borders on abstract. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines near the climax (“The method he employed…”, “Each coin emitted…”) verge on explanatory redundancy. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final paragraph’s momentum dips slightly with reflective summary (“He remembered the ancient scholar’s warning…”), though it serves thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “dust motes into tiny prisms” conveys light, setting, and transformation). Figurative language is coherent—sea monsters as “maps of dread,” grief as “burden into bridge”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“translucent statues that hummed with a low, mournful frequency”) slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final line’s “echoing the names she had forged” cleanly recharges the opening’s “unkept promises.”

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “his magic was lukewarm, it warmed the metal only enough to expand tiny fissures”). Figurative language is coherent—water/light motifs unify imagery without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“scattering it like shards of sky onto the rivulet…”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s refracted suns justify elevated diction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwrought (“restless water,” “whisper of old pine,” “mirrored glass over her thoughts”), stacking metaphors that blur clarity. The phrase “precisely humane” appears as a label without embodiment, and “expunge a lingering myth” verges on abstraction. Final paragraph tightens effectively, but mid-story density slows momentum with repetitive lyrical phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“blue sapphire fire,” “amber hiss,” “shattered glass” light), though occasional overwriting appears (“phosphorescent snow” followed by “fragment of the touch of wonder”). Sentence variety sustains rhythm, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “logic and intuition were beginning to sing together” echoes earlier “bridge between reason and reverie,” slightly dulling propulsion. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (echo, cathedral, vault) without muddle. However, slight overwriting in high-pressure beats: “attentively inventive, always tweaking his tools and thoughts as if the forest itself demanded revisions” stacks modifiers where one strong verb would suffice. One paraphrase loop: “fractionally… not because the task was done, but because he had honored” echoes same idea across two clauses. Closure beat remains clear despite these minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Strong verbs (“vivify,” “coaxing,” “sliced”) and concrete nouns (“basalt,” “synapses,” “ether”) avoid abstraction. Rhythm varies effectively, especially in the climax’s short, percussive beats. One paraphrase loop: “sliced through pretense” appears twice within 10 lines, slightly dulling impact; otherwise, no scaffold or register drift. Closure image remains sharp despite minor repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “storm-born silence,” “orthogonal approaches like invisible veins,” “fragrance that seemed to rewrite the night itself” all advance atmosphere and theme without overwriting. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with momentum. One minor flaw: “humming with a promise of bloom that could eclipse any ordinary fragrance” slightly strains the metaphor (how does a seed hum? how does fragrance eclipse?). Still, information density is high, and the final lines resonate without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (e.g., “macrate the stagnant air and reshape it into a trembling chorus”). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of peak beats, risking overwriting; “blade of sound” and “broken compass” slightly strain coherence. Minor synonym churn (“macerate,” “grinding,” “peeled away”) in middle section dulls propulsion. Final paragraph tightens effectively, redeeming momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly precise, with high information density and rhythmic variation. However, figurative language occasionally overloads (“claws brushing spines of ancient, frost-bitten volumes” → “mist-woven verses” → “lattice of interiorized exteriors”), risking slight muddle in peak beats. No paraphrase loops, but one register drift: “dimensionally homesick” and “conceptual repricing” flirt with academic diction outside the guardian’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with multi-functional lines (“each droplet a silent promise” advances atmosphere, character, and plot), and rhythm varies purposefully. However, figurative language occasionally overloads: “frozen bloom of light unfurled, delicate as winter roses, yet burning with purpose” mixes botanical and thermal metaphors slightly awkwardly. Minor scaffold appears in repetitive constructions (“He mixed… He brushed… He waited…”), though not enough to dull closure. Final image (“crozier’s glow remained—a silent promise”) resolves with elegant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “cables humming with forgotten frequencies” establishes tone while advancing atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (harp/cables, comet/stairwell) and pays off in closure (“cables sang a low hymn”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“serenely electric aura aligning with dormant circuitry”) slightly blurs causality, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“every hush concealed the first note”) recharges the opening “broken harp” without redundancy. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, though one passive construction (“pathways… revealed”) dulls agency.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“sand began to rise, defying gravity” compresses wonder and causality). Figurative language is coherent—sound “tangles with wind,” timelines “drift like ships”—without mixed metaphors. Minor redundancy in “resiliently positive” repetition (three times) slightly dulls uniqueness, but no scaffold loops or register drift mar peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence seals momentum without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, varied sentence openings, and rhythmic propulsion that mirrors the story’s pulse. Figurative language is dense but coherent—“sinew thread, thin as a whispered promise”—and avoids mixed metaphors. One minor flaw: slight overuse of “realistically imaginary” and “rational enchantment” edges toward label-repetition, but not enough to obscure clarity. The final paragraph’s cadence perfectly resolves the opening motif, with no scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“alien light braided with distant suns,” “mournful blue” lanterns), and sentences vary rhythmically to support contemplative pacing. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “expand its reach toward the unseen stars” followed by “unfolded horizons were no longer a distant promise but a reachable map.” Also, “somber marvel” repeats as tonal anchor but risks scaffold. No loops in closure beat, preserving high-band eligibility, but minor redundancy prevents 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors (“humming like a dying heart,” “bridge that linked the living and the dead”) are coherent and recurring. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“faint drumming of distant heartbeats, each one a thread I was sworn to follow”), where figurative density slightly blurs propulsion. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax: “silence into a bridge” then “bridge that linked”—a subtle redundancy. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, restoring color and promise without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“serpents waiting,” “jellyfish bellies”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“lattice of undersea cables drawn in phosphorescent ink”) borders on ornamental but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies effectively across beats, though one run of participle openings (“slipped... lifted... aligned...”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “frozen lantern,” “shimmering cascade of code,” “midnight ink” all do triple duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. One minor density risk: figurative language appears in most high-pressure sentences, but pattern is taught early and pays off in closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—every line propels.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fissures, echoes, wings as punctuation) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“spider‑web of fissures that caught stray light… repay them as songs”) slightly slows momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“He turned and walked away…”) earns its lyrical weight through accumulated resonance. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively; paragraph cuts heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“gravitationally playful pull that made the moss sway…”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism, and sentence variety supports emotional arc without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose maintains high information density: “roots pushed up, breaking free from the metal-reinforced soil” conveys action, setting, and theme in one clause. Sentence openings vary (“High above…”, “He walked…”, “Suddenly…”) and paragraph lengths breathe with scene tempo. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines (“ribbons of light that wrapped… coating them in amber”) but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “thunderstorm in a bottle” conveys object, metaphor, and mission in five words. Sentence openings vary (“It was at…”, “He moved…”, “A buzzing whine…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “roiling clouds sealed by glass and a whispered promise to the rains he could not bring”—the clause after “glass” slightly dilutes immediacy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language remains coherent (storm = static = hope), though “brittle hush” recurs just enough to feel intentional, not redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent, with recurring motifs (halo, hush, gleam) reinforcing texture. However, near-synonym loops appear: “whispering gleam” (3x), “quietly persistent” (3x), “misting hush” (4x)—creating a slight cadence fatigue. A paraphrase-loop occurs in the final paragraph: “stitching the broken silence… into a tapestry of sound” echoes earlier “translate absence into motion.” Still, sentence variety, strong verbs (“shivered,” “unfurled,” “lapped”), and sensory precision maintain propulsion despite minor overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “equations written in rhyme” conveys concept, setting, and tone). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—“ghostly fireflies,” “transient constellations”—but metaphors remain coherent within the established logic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence (“geometry whispered, and solitude observed…”) resolves with rhythmic grace, though one or two stacked modifiers (“quiet miracle,” “infinite corridors”) flirt with excess.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density (“pigments faded like old letters,” “tide spilling into a hidden cove”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“luminous absence of daylight,” “hush of improbable beginnings”) risks figurative saturation, but payoff in the closure (“lingering scent of jasmine answer the unanswered questions”) justifies it. No loops or scaffold; every image advances theme or character. One near-paraphrase (“cipher of longing” repeated) costs 0.4, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten: phrases like “tapestry woven from forgotten dreams” or “hush of cosmic possibility” verge on purple in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“enveloped secrets” repeated without added pressure). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports theme, yet figurative density sometimes blurs causality (e.g., “world melted into a tapestry” obscures physical action). Final paragraph’s momentum sags slightly under accumulative abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “spores tickle her senses,” “glass face cracked into a mosaic of stars.” Figurative language is consistent—constellations recur across hulls, sextant, and mushroom—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “chorus of ancient singers” slightly strains, but momentum holds. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“taste of crisp nostalgia lingering like salt on her tongue”) perfectly fuses motif, tone, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “dust lay like ancient whispers,” “shadow caught in glass quivered, its edges sharpening like the blade of a promise.” Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught, never muddled. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One paraphrase loop: “reversible exile” appears thrice in close proximity without added pressure. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “radiant hush” appears four times, verging on paraphrase-loop. Figurative density is high throughout, including in moderate-pressure beats (“storm’s frantic essence turned into nourishing rain”), risking slight muddle. However, rhythm modulates well, and key images remain clear. A minor scaffold artifact (“succor” used three times as noun/verb without variation) nudges score down, though closure image retains clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“the hush that accumulates silence was not empty but full”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (hush as weight, silence as fabric) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“lucid unrest, a calm yet uneasy feeling…”) slightly bloats momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence (“stars above traced new patterns… purest peace”) masterfully varies sentence length for breath and closure. Artifact-free at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “sky bruised purple” conveys mood, era, and visual tone). Figurative language is pattern-taught: rain, tearing, silence recur with evolving weight. Minor overwriting in “stone echo on the hill” slightly dilutes immediacy, and one paraphrase loop (“methodically curious” repeated) nudges down. But closure beat is artifact-free, and rhythm breathes with scene needs—no syntactic monotony or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences often multitask (e.g., “filament… resisted the pull of the sea until surrender allowed a pulse” conveys action, metaphor, and theme). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“luminous path of release,” “sophisticated melancholy”) borders on label-speak but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cascade of images (“crystal shards… tiny stars… silent chorus”) maintains propulsion without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose dazzles with high information density: “flower press bolt plate” conveys function, material, and ritual weight in four words. Figurative language avoids muddle—“sky pulsed like a living circuit” merges tech and biology coherently. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“looping lines and symbols, each stroke a cipher”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure’s “luminous letters that spelled the balladeer’s name” redeems with visceral specificity. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies masterfully between thunderclaps.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical, with strong verbs (“thrums,” “unveiling,” “spilled”) and sensory specificity. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “prismatic shards that danced across the stone walls, unveiling hidden symbols” could tighten. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences restate light’s role in decryption (lines 12–14), triggering a −0.2 loop penalty. Closure remains clear despite these micro-slips.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language, though “quietly explosive” appears twice with slight redundancy. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the gondola’s sway. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“ledger of memory for the empty spaces that hover above the world”) edges toward abstraction, but closure image (comet as silent fireworks) redeems momentum. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “pigments caught fire, spilling azure across rough bark walls like a sunrise trapped in timber”). Figurative language is consistent—light, breath, fractals—and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“fractally precise hand that seemed to echo the coin’s tiny grooves”) edges toward redundancy, but no loops or scaffold mar clarity. Sentence variety supports emotional cadence, especially in the thunderous fall versus silent mural contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as language, birds as constellations) and pays off in the halo’s pulse syncing with murmurations. Minor scaffold in “she noted… she traced… she whispered” risks template cadence but is redeemed by varied syntax elsewhere. No loops or mixed metaphors; closure image (“silver threads that wrapped around the copper like vines”) is clear, specific, and causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“gears shimmering like frozen rain” conveys appearance, sound, and temperature). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional tempo. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: three consecutive similes (“like old driftwood,” “like sea‑foam,” “like frozen rain”) risk density overload, though pattern is taught early. No loops or scaffold; final line (“a keeper of keys and quiet hopes”) resonates without redundancy. Deduction for slight figurative stacking near climax, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally ornate (“orchard planet glimmered under twin suns” borders on purple). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or plot. Minor redundancy in describing the nebula twice, but justified by narrative rhythm. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening, creating circular propulsion. One mixed metaphor (“brambled hope that twined through their hearts”) slightly muddles tactile logic, but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally overwrought (“stone ribs bruised awe” risks mixed metaphor). Most sentences advance multiple layers—character, atmosphere, plot—but two adjacent lines repeat “bruised awe” (once for lighthouse, once for sea), creating a minor paraphrase loop. Figurative language is consistent and taught early (hush as fabric, time as ripple). Final paragraph avoids scaffold; closure image (“promise echoing forever in the stars”) recharges the lantern’s earlier flicker without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Figurative language is consistent (“frost retreats like a dying dragon”) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “graceless beauty… more like a wound than a miracle” slightly strains metaphor, but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line (“travelers' safety glows brighter than any curse”) earns its resonance without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence advances character, setting, or theme (“stone walls twisting like intertwined strands of DNA” establishes place and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths mirror emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“translucent bridge emerged where once only emptiness lay”) slightly dilutes propulsion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (music, weaving, biology).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: nearly every phrase advances atmosphere, plot, or theme. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“fragmentary tone that stitched the library together in integrated fragmentation”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. Final paragraph’s cadence (“weaving through the titles… single chord”) propels momentum without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “brine” droplets, “burnt cumin” remorse, and “sugar in rainwater” dissolve show/tell boundaries. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“each motion a recipe, each pause a tasting”) risks density bloat, but peak beats avoid muddle. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Final line’s “sweet promise” lands cleanly, echoing opening rain without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “brass body humming with the echo of centuries” conveys object, sound, history). Figurative language is pattern-taught (sonic metaphors: grumble, chorus, chime) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“vigorous and tender, like a mother guiding a newborn through storm”) slightly blurs immediacy but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful: metaphors (“wind whispered like distant circuitry”) serve theme and POV. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, peak beats suffer mild overwriting: “each shard became a neuron, each fissure a synapse” borders on explanatory redundancy, and “chaotically precise aspirations” risks label-speak. No fatal loops, but figurative density occasionally slows propulsion. Final lines avoid scaffold, earning strong momentum despite minor ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“ink‑splattered spiral intersecting a half‑opened eye—had appeared… its lines becoming seeds of vigilance”). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during inversion. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“latent fire,” “crackled with latent fire”) risks redundancy, but coherence holds. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“guided by the clandestinely luminous seedlings”) recharges the opening spiral with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“symphonically minded,” “empathy in motion” verge on label-speak). Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., shift to hedgehog’s reaction). Minor redundancy in describing silence (“intensely quiet hush,” “mute reverence,” “silent world”) slightly dulls momentum. No scaffold loops or syntactic monotony; figurative language coheres around acoustic/tactile motifs. Final lines resonate without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“wan flag against the wind,” “aching beauty hidden within the most difficult positions”), but rhythm remains controlled. Sentence openings vary, and paragraphs shift length to mirror cadence of thought. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines restating “hopeful melancholy” twice near the end—a paraphrase loop that slightly dulls closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; diction stays within the tutor’s plausible lexicon. High information density, though one or two modifiers could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but pattern is taught early (“tools hung like notes,” “humming iron ribs”) and pays off in closure (“resonant chord from metal and silence”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “trembling like a stage actor awaiting applause” slightly veers into mixed register. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Final paragraph’s momentum falters slightly with explanatory phrasing (“a discipline he called…”), but rhythm recovers in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often overwritten: figurative density appears in nearly every sentence (“moss and moonlight,” “pages of a forgotten manuscript”), creating a perfumed haze that dulls propulsion. Repetition of “undercurrent of wisdom,” “wildflower hush,” and “serenity within motion” borders on paraphrase-loop. Final third retains elevated diction without register drift, but the cumulative ornamentation slows momentum. Still, sentence variety and sensory specificity prevent major clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “roots swayed like kelp” conveys inversion + biology + mood). Figurative language is coherent—coral-like arches, balloon fruit—and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in “emerald fire” verges on purple, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence (“hovering… plotted… determined”) accelerates cleanly toward next expedition, reinforcing theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gusts that curled like ghosts,” “red needle trembling like a nervous heart.” Minor overwriting in mid-section (“whispering tunnels,” “tapestry of future movement”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative logic holds—wind metaphors cohere—and closure lines (“shadows stretching like hopeful fingers”) land cleanly. One near-redundancy (“measured, understood, and guided”) costs 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language, but risks overwriting: “oscillating repose,” “unfettered itself,” “sculpted hush” recur with near-incantatory force. While mostly coherent, phrases like “certify wonder as essential” flirt with abstraction, and “prism-song bell ringer” leans toward label. Yet rhythm varies skillfully, sentence openings diversify, and every line advances atmosphere or theme. No loops, redundancies, or clarity breaks—just a hair’s breadth from flawless lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“avalanchingly quiet,” “loom of possibility”) is consistent and physically grounded. Minor overwriting in “tapestry of echoes” risks abstraction, but closure image redeems it. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; sentence openings vary naturally. Read-aloud rhythm perfectly calibrated to story’s meditative pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and paragraph cuts feel intentional. However, figurative density occasionally borders on overwriting (“topaz walls seemed to pulse with a faint, violet hue that whispered equations”)—a minor muddle in peak beats. No loops or scaffold, but one or two adjacent lines verge on paraphrase (“borrowed personalities… slipping their cadence”). Still, propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the ridgeway stretched beneath ribbons of dancing light, a natural cathedral where memory faded into legend”), yet momentum never stalls. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light = germination, vibration = connection) and payoff is consistent. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“thoughts unfurling like sunrise-kissed leaves”) slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence (“humming light that promised more stories to germinate”) earns its lyricism through earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“truthful lie,” “shifted hush”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“bloomed into luminous veins that traced the prism’s colors”), but coherence holds. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“shadows lengthened and brightened in equal measure”) recharges the core tension with elegant economy.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—most lines multitask (e.g., “dew-slick ground” conveys setting, enables reflection, implies fragility). Figurative language is pattern-taught: weaving metaphors sustain coherence without muddle. Minor overwriting in “time's unraveling tapestry” slightly strains the textile motif, and “stoically sparkling” recurs with near-synonym redundancy. Still, rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence, and closure image (“faintly glowed”) lands with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (azure = defiance) and payoff-rich (blade’s “low azure note”). Minor overwriting in two high-pressure beats (“rubble of his past failures pulse like heartbeats” leans slightly purple), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening, closing the sonic loop without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“breaths caught like pearls in a glass bottle,” “walls dissolved into a cascade of light”) but occasionally over-embellished (“lattice of possibilities that seemed to whisper”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor register drift in peak beats (“cyclically spontaneous rhythm”) slightly jars but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph maintains momentum and resolves with resonant specificity—shard as scattered stars—without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“luminescent ache of memory,” “ghostly light”) slightly blurs sense but doesn’t obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent (light/glass/stone motif).

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as serpent, laughter as thunder) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“whispered promise,” “sapphire currents”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “gentle yet fierce” sunrise crystallizes tone without redundancy. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, though two adjacent “slithered… steering” constructions flirt with template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “tea steam into ribbons of light that danced through the mist” conveys atmosphere, action, and theme simultaneously. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm breathes with the narrative arc. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“cascade of light that rose like a sunrise over the mist”)—a slight figurative redundancy—but clarity remains intact. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; every line advances image, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “a lattice of sorrow, each filament humming with a quantified sorrow” compresses concept, image, and sound. Figurative language is coherent—sorrow as filament, dreams as smoke—and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold appears in “quantified sorrow” repetition (three times), but it serves thematic reinforcement rather than loop. Final paragraph’s cadence varies effectively, and the closing image (“moon’s gentle smile”) lands without sentimentality due to earned context.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, figurative language occasionally stacks without breath—e.g., “loom of woven dawns,” “ribbons of light,” “tapestry of twilight”—risking slight overwriting in peak beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “bound release” appears three times with diminishing impact. Final image remains clear, so artifacts don’t obscure closure, but they prevent 9+ line-level perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery, but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion—e.g., “dialogues that nested within dialogues” risks recursive vagueness. No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences use “nest” variants (“nested paradoxes,” “nest within riddles,” “nestled paradoxes”), creating slight synonym churn. Final paragraph’s cadence is masterful, yet “enlarged tranquility settle like a warm blanket” verges on mixed metaphor (tranquility as both fog and blanket). These are hairline flaws, but prevent 8.8+ due to Q7 artifact sensitivity near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“heuristically gentle,” “uncloak itself like a shy guest”) and paid off in closure. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“tenuous absolution that came from holding something both lost and present”), slightly blurring immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mar key beats. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with stacked clauses, yet the amber glow of crumbs lingers with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“aisles whispering in a quartz hush” establishes sound, texture, and mood), but occasional overwriting appears: “sunrise of promises” borders on mixed metaphor, and “filament of story” slightly strains. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s momentum falters minutely with “shimmering in gratitude”—a rare personification—but closure image remains sharp. Read-aloud rhythm is strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rumors that tasted like iron,” “silence settled like a blanket.” Figurative language is consistent (tactile, auditory) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “curiously steadfast” (used twice) and “comforting unease” (three times)—not looped, but slightly over-relied upon. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve breath and tension. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; high information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “lavender scent curled like a soft binary code” merges setting, theme, and tech in one image. Minor overwriting appears in mid-section (“cascade of taste changes signalling the convergence of their intents”) where figurative density briefly outpaces clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “terrestrially cosmic” borders on label-speak without fuller embodiment. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening while advancing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but pattern-taught early (“frozen starlight,” “auroral sorrow”) and paid off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“mournful beauty that painted the air with melancholy light”) borders on stacked modifiers, but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. No loops or scaffold—each image advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glass towers breathing misty sighs,” “wind carried the taste of rust.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (metallic light motifs) and payoff-earned (plate’s green return). Minor redundancy in “wilted courtyard”/“wilt near dishonesty,” but no scaffold loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure line (“candor can bloom”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, high information per line, and rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “symphonies of truth” recurs with near-identical phrasing, and “glisten” borders on motif fatigue. No paraphrase loops, but slight figurative stacking (“silent concerto,” “visual chorus,” “mute rhythm”) risks texture blur. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, and sentence openings vary effectively. Momentum holds, though one or two adjacent lines restate the same idea (“promise… will not fade,” “tiny flare of truth”).

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful; metaphors cohere (fears fold like origami, stars like fractured glass). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. However, mild overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “miniaturized chaos humming in synchrony with Vira's own circuitry” stacks modifiers where simpler syntax would heighten tension. One paraphrase loop: “static dissolve, replaced by a fragmented wholeness that felt like reclaimed memory” repeats the same idea across two clauses. Not severe, but prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “sandstorm calm” repeats four times, and figurative density peaks in high-pressure moments (“metal’s cool memory,” “healing ripple”). Some redundancy exists—“locked mailbox mystery” appears verbatim twice—and the phrase “led through following” is awkwardly recursive. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and most lines multitask (e.g., “puddles that reflected a sky still heavy…” establishes time, mood, and motif). A tighter edit would eliminate scaffold phrases like “the key to the mystery lay not in brute force but in listening.”

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented (“sigh of ancient tides,” “spider spins its web”) with figurative density in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“calm defiance” repeated; “encode frailties” echoed). Yet rhythm varies skillfully, sentences advance multiple layers, and the final lines land with clarity. No scaffold or momentum drag, but near-purple passages flirt with opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (gravity as “shy tides,” memories as “minnows”) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“sand fell away like sifted dreams”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Final lines achieve gleaming concision without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-functional lines (“fireflies traced luminous arcs, crafting a tranquil blaze that seemed to set the darkness aflame without burning”), yet avoids overwriting. Figurative language is coherent—light, silence, and water motifs interweave without contradiction. Minor redundancy in “smoothed hush” repetition, but it serves thematic accumulation, not loop. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the brook’s resumed song, creating rhythmic closure. One near-paraphrase (“quiet unfurled like silk… spreading across the meadow”) slightly dulls propulsion, preventing 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and musical (“night air felt suddenly conspiratorial,” “stitch the night’s fleeting light into the brick’s silent grammar”) without overwriting. Figurative language is pattern-taught (stone as speaker) and payoff-earned. Minor scaffold: “patiently nimble” repeats, but functions as motif. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors building sighs—propulsive yet breathy. One near-redundancy (“murmurs embedded in brick and timber” / “stone’s murmurs”) costs 0.4, but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.3)
    Overwriting plagues peak beats: figurative density is excessive (“garden draped in deep violet velvet,” “lattice of recollection,” “visible chords”), creating metaphor fatigue. Repetitive phrasing (“tragically radiant” x3, “ghostly resolve” x3) and synonym loops (“quarantined memory,” “silenced sighs,” “library of sighs”) dull momentum. Final paragraph stacks abstractions (“new archive waiting to be filled”) that obscure emotional clarity. Cadence becomes incantatory, sacrificing propulsion for ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “thorn was more than ornament; it was a calibrated treason”). Figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off: aurora “mourned and celebrated,” marble “cradles sighs.” Minor overwriting in mid-section (“weaponized… balm, not a blade”) edges toward abstraction, but closure beat remains concrete. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One near-paraphrase (“forgive the unfinished” / “cherish the unfinished”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (reed, shell, web, lattice) without muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density is high. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats (“webs of intrigue tightened, as if invisible threads were drawing her…”), where one metaphor might suffice. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters minimally under accumulated lyricism, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “borrowed starlight... painting walls with trembling silver”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (filaments, lattice, window) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“weave truth carefully, threading each revelation like ice filaments”) edges toward purple, but closure beat remains clear. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary effectively. Final line crystallizes motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff, risking purple prose. Phrases like “loom of thoughts,” “hesitant punctuation marks,” and “scintillatingly somber” repeat conceptual redundancy across adjacent lines. The whisk “trembled, releasing fragrant steam that curled around his thoughts”—mixed sensory logic dulls clarity. Momentum stalls in descriptive loops rather than advancing causality or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and largely efficient, with strong verbs (“clenched,” “snapped,” “cradled”) and selective sensory detail. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “whispering sea of ash,” “wounded star,” and “beacon of clarity amid chaos” verge on stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony, but the phrase “comfortable lies” repeats three times, creating mild synonym churn. Closure beat remains clear despite minor figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: stacked modifiers (“fragmented radio frequencies began to unfold a story of rebellion”) and repetitive stems (“each... each...”) create mild syntactic monotony. Figurative density is high but coherent within the taught lyric mode. Closure beat (“sunrise bloom from darkness”) avoids muddle, yet mid-story paraphrase loops (“variant allegiance” restated without escalation) slightly dull momentum. Information density remains strong, with most lines advancing atmosphere or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “sand‑torn wood,” “lonesome splendor,” “positively wistful” verge on mannered repetition. Figurative density is high, yet mostly coherent—metaphors align (fireflies, constellations, amber). Minor scaffold: “hoping the wind would sweeten…” followed by later “purpose sweetened forever” risks echo-loop. Final paragraph’s “shared hymn” slightly abstracts, but momentum holds. No fatal artifacts, though near-purple patches flirt with opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: metaphors (“storm-tossed sky,” “amber shards”) serve atmosphere without muddle. Minor overwriting in “fleshly ethereal glow” and “quiet hymn” edges toward abstraction, but rhythm varies effectively. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; every line advances mood, character, or plot. However, “logically emotional mind wrestled with the paradox” risks label-speak, slightly dulling immediacy in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled; figurative language (“ice sang a thin, glassy hymn,” “silver smile” of moonlight) serves atmosphere without muddling clarity. However, slight overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “patient revolution… slow uprising of patience that could unyoke the restless heart” borders on redundant abstraction. Sentence variety is strong, though a few adjacent lines restate concepts (“restrained wildness” appears three times). Closure remains sharp, but minor density bloat prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often lush and rhythmic, but suffers from figurative density in high-pressure beats: “droplet clung… like memories entangled,” “reverberate hope,” “fortified vulnerability” approach label-speak. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“reverberate” used four times with overlapping meanings). Sentence openings vary well, but cadence occasionally stalls in mid-story exposition (“I recalled my own entangled memories…”). Final paragraph recovers with strong propulsion, yet the phrase “shadow that had long guided the city” introduces vague abstraction where concrete closure was earned.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but suffers from recurring phrasing: “vibrant hush” appears three times, and “by the way light breaks through storm clouds” is repeated verbatim—a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, “coat bore the weight of iron bars” borders on mixed metaphor (literal bars vs. symbolic weight). Sentence variety is strong, yet the second use of “In the calm before realization” creates a structural echo that stalls propulsion. No fatal artifacts, but minor scaffold weakens peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff (e.g., “yearning algorithm—a self‑editing code of longing etched into the glider’s navigation crystal”). Figurative language is consistent and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“fractured reality into a hundred colored possibilities”), slightly slowing momentum, but peak beats remain clear. Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates perfectly. One paraphrase loop (“chased a bell no ear could hear, a joke only the universe giggled at”) slightly dilutes closure sharpness—hence just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “scattering the numbers across unrelated threads, as if the network itself sensed the absence”). Figurative language is consistent—data as sound, light, ghost—but avoids muddle. One paraphrase loop: “forgotten songs” appears three times in close proximity without added pressure. Final paragraph’s rhythm falters slightly with stacked clauses, dulling the closing image’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “frost like a ticking metronome”). Figurative language is controlled, though occasionally thick in peak beats (“mirrors sighed,” “light traced a path… knitting pieces”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in the climax (“glimmered like a tiny sun”) slightly dulls propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “lace tip... fragile compass for the wind” conveys object, metaphor, and character state in one phrase. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“choir of surrender,” “solemn lullaby”) risks figurative saturation but avoids muddle. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“Night fell,” “I unwrapped,” “The wind rose”). Closure image (“lace catching first light”) remains clear despite poetic register—no artifact penalties applied.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented; figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, risking density overload in high-pressure moments (e.g., “amber light seemed like liquid memory, each flicker a soft promise…”). Mixed metaphors surface: the letter “trembling like a silent confession” then “wanted to be heard”—confusing animate/inanimate logic. Repetitive stems (“drawing parallels” appears four times) create paraphrase loops. Despite rhythmic control, scaffold phrases (“his motive was simple yet profound”) dilute propulsion. Final paragraph suffers synonym churn (“passionate subtlety,” “quiet endurance,” “gentle persuasion”).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“whisperfield calm,” “sand slipping through open fingers”) and payoff is earned. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“dew on his inner landscape”) slightly blurs embodiment, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line’s cadence perfectly echoes opening, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “morning mist swirled like whispered secrets,” “tears fell like dew” verge on cliché. Figurative density is high in calm beats but thins appropriately during action. No paraphrase loops, but minor redundancy exists (“fragrant cradle,” “lavender sanctuary”). Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, though “timeless canvas awaiting the next arc” risks abstraction. Overall, rhythm supports theme, but three instances of mixed metaphor (“pulse with collective heartbeat,” “mending wounded spirits,” “tide turning toward sunrise”) slightly blur physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (light as sound, crystal as witness) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “fractured sequences that fractured time itself into glints”—repetition borders on scaffold. Otherwise, high information density, varied syntax, and resonant final line (“echo of her own quiet resolve”) earn top marks. No loops, clichés, or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“taste like half‑remembered songs,” “tide of longing”—but avoids overwriting; metaphors cohere within the sonic/memory motif. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor redundancy in “echoes” and “longing” appears twice near climax but doesn’t dull closure. Final lines (“the garden’s mist sighed in agreement”) land cleanly, echoing earlier breath motifs without paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery—“luminous ache,” “filament of starlight”—but avoids purple overload by anchoring metaphor in function (e.g., gears as musical notes enabling attunement). Sentence openings vary effectively; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching narrative breath. Minor redundancy appears in repeated “luminous ache” mentions (lines 5, 14, 28), slightly dulling its final transformation. No filter-verb stacks or syntactic monotony; however, the phrase “changelessly constant” recurs three times with diminishing returns, bordering on scaffold. Still, information density remains high, and closure image (“carrying the steadiness... into the infinite”) lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “each fragment held a note of the scent of hope” conflates senses confusingly; “hymning the mundane” feels coined rather than earned. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“pulsing stillness” repeated; “decisively kind” echoed). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, figurative density in peak beats (final chord passage) risks obscuring clarity—hope’s “perfume of pine and rain” reads as decorative, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“ripples like a thin veil of glass,” “silvery forms streamed outward”—and avoids redundancy. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with ritual intensity. Minor overwriting appears in the climax (“translucent doorway flickered,” “cascade of light poured,” “walls painted with images”)—three consecutive figurative phrases slightly blur propulsion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density remains high. The final line (“another quietly deliberate mind”) resonates without summary, though one mixed metaphor (“bridge the loop”) mildly disrupts coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“cold certainty seep into the marrow,” “embryonic galaxy”) risks figurative muddle but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains sharp despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“zephyr bloom of syllables,” “luminous chords”). However, metaphors remain coherent within the established logic—glass sings, mist breathes—and serve accumulation. No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences use “reflectively vibrant” or variants, creating slight redundancy. Final paragraph maintains propulsion; artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “cathedral of rusted racks reclaimed by emerald silence” establishes setting, tone, and theme in one phrase. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“honeyed hush” repeated four times), risking figurative saturation, but never obscures causality. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, and every image serves momentum. No loops or scaffold, though “proffer” borders on ornamental repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “swirling hush,” “narrative river rushed forward,” and “trembles like a heartbeat” recur with near-synonym variation, creating mild paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high in peak beats without sufficient pattern payoff—e.g., “closing pages” inhales, then later “whisper of closing pages” reappears without evolved meaning. Sentence openings vary well, but “She...” begins six key actions, risking template cadence. Clarity holds, but artifact accumulation prevents 8.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “golden threads of light spiraled outward, spinning golden stories” does triple duty (image, action, theme). Rhythm varies effectively, though occasional overwriting appears (“world held its breath,” “valley would hear its own heartbeat”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the climax lean on “golden” repetition without intensifying pressure. Closure image remains clear despite minor figurative saturation in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits exceptional rhythmic control: varied sentence lengths mirror ritual pacing, paragraph cuts align with breath units. High information density—“flash-paper flared into a brief, harmless sunrise” conveys action, metaphor, and safety in one image. Minimal artifacts: one borderline redundancy (“moving stillness” appears thrice, but functions as motif). Figurative language remains coherent (light as fire, snowfall, lighthouse), never muddling causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as chorus, echoes as tide) and pays off in the hum-conduit. Minor overwriting in “bruised by frost and flame”—slightly strained—but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are sharp. Final line (“each photon dancing like a memory”) perfectly recharges the opening’s reflective motif. One near-redundancy: “reverse-engineering the secrets… one reflected ray at a time” slightly echoes prior phrasing, but rhythm justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but coherence suffers in high-pressure beats: “calcify the dripping water into translucent statues that sang the forgotten weight” mixes tactile, visual, and auditory metaphors without grounding. Minor paraphrase loops (“shingled hush” repeated 4x) dull momentum. Sentence openings vary well, yet overuse of participle phrases (“feeling the world reweave…”) creates rhythmic monotony near closure. Final paragraph recovers with strong propulsion and resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but occasional figurative stacking (“rust-hued peace,” “silver veins,” “translucent memory vault”) risks slight overwriting in peak beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors metronomic rain, reinforcing closure. One near-redundancy (“steady as a sunrise… warm glow would mingle”) slightly dulls propulsion, preventing a 9.0+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “metallic heart,” “quilt of regrets,” “jagged edge of forgotten vows” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphors in tactile reality. Sentence openings vary (“The sky...”, “Above the clouds...”, “She heard...”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting in the mist fragments (“child’s laughter twisted into a warning”) edges toward abstraction but pays off in the ghost’s wavering. No loops or scaffolding; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Closure image (“sky that seemed both older and newer”) recharges the opening’s temporal dissonance cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-ornamented: phrases like “echo of departing carnival lights still faint in the dust” and “stoic wonder settle like a quiet anthem” risk purple prose. Minor redundancy appears (“redirected flows surged… coaxing dormant servos to whir, as if the terminal itself inhaled”). Sentence openings vary well, and information density is high, but figurative density in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished: “excruciatingly gentle” repeats four times, verging on scaffold-loop. The phrase “the night he first imagined…” appears verbatim twice—a clear paraphrase error that dulls momentum. Figurative density is high but coherent; metaphors (memory as bear, time as breath) remain consistent. Final paragraph avoids purple excess, landing cleanly on “reverent silence.” These artifacts prevent 9+ but don’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “serene upheaval of routine” and “calm storm of purpose” risk abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“thoughtfully clear” appears three times with diminishing returns). However, information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, ending on resonant image (“each sunrise would bring another chance”) that echoes the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“dock stretched like a pale spine, its wood glinting gold even as snow clung to its ribs”), but occasional overwriting risks muddle: “fulgurite glass... sang of storm-born memories” leans metaphorical without grounding. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though three adjacent sentences begin with “He” during climax (minor template cadence). Closure beat remains clear, and rhythm breathes with scene needs—slowing for decoding, quickening at revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“stone faces cracked like old parchment,” “golden hue flickering like a dying sun”), though occasional overwriting appears (“lonesome splendor,” “bruised violet”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary (“The traveler drifted…”, “He had been…”, “After the last ship…”), and paragraph cuts align with emotional shifts. Minor figurative stacking in the climax (“pulse of the world’s hidden recovery,” “gentle tide of understanding”) slightly dulls immediacy but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “bedraggled prince drifted” establishes tone and state in three words; “gears humming softly” merges sound and function. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“collage of ancient colors,” “living sunrise”) slightly blurs focus, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters with repetitive “forever echoing” constructions, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with imagery but avoids overwriting; most figurative language serves accumulation. Minor redundancy appears in adjacent lines (“scar of the sand itself were humming... scars can indeed sing”), creating a slight paraphrase loop. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with the scene’s cadence. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure image (“red thread glistened like a sunrise promise”) is clear and potent, though one or two mid-story metaphors verge on ornamental (“sky quilted with moving clouds”).

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“its water long since vanished” conveys time, loss, and setting), and rhythm mirrors emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “spilling a cascade of tiny lights that rose like fireflies” leans on familiar simile, and “kaleidoscopic prayers” borders on mixed metaphor (prayers aren’t visual). No loops or scaffolding, but two adjacent sentences near the climax restate the box’s resistance without added pressure. Final paragraph’s momentum dips slightly with summary (“pledged to guard… scatter them like seeds”), though the last line recovers with concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“generational patterns that had guided her lineage through epochs of silent star-birth” borders on abstraction). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or action. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm mirrors the sonar’s pulse—expansive then taut. Minor deduction for one mixed metaphor (“petals pressed into the soil of time” slightly muddles botanical/cosmic registers), but closure remains vivid and unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally overwrought (“humid sigh,” “inked verses waiting for a hand”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or theme. Figurative coherence holds—butterflies, ribbons, and stone interweave without contradiction. Minor deduction: “thundering calm” appears thrice, verging on repetitive motif rather than evolving insight.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery, but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion: “searing reverie that painted the horizon with fire” followed by “sunrise bleed into the water” verges on stacked modifiers. Minor paraphrase loops (“incremental absolution” repeated near-verbatim; “shared balance” echoed three times) slightly reduce momentum. Yet information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme—and the read-aloud rhythm varies effectively. Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors cohere (gloom as velvet, echoes as mist). Minor overwriting in “tenderly organized, each compartment lined with faded vellum”—slightly redundant. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence (“ever untangling the threads…”) propels without monotony. One mixed metaphor (“silo… turning starlight into a silent drumbeat”) slightly strains physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “frost-resistant barley” advances plot and theme; “lattice of arrows” visualizes abstract modeling. Sentence openings vary (“At the foot…”, “There lived…”, “One dawn…”), avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shimmered like the feather’s iridescence, each stroke encoding a scenario”) edges toward density overload, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; every line propels. Final image (“lake reflecting not only stars but the bright horizon”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“her thistled calm demeanor soothing the dust that hung like old parchment” conveys trait, action, and setting). However, figurative density occasionally borders on overwriting: “fireflies trapped in amber,” “phantom verses,” “harbors of sound” risk stacking metaphors without grounding. One paraphrase loop: “whispered chords” appears twice in close proximity with minimal pressure shift. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but mid-text lyricism slightly dulls propulsion—costing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “shards caught the light, refracting it into a kaleidoscope that painted the walls with muted rainbows”). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting (-0.5). Minor paraphrase loops (“whispers floated… mirage of safety”; later “mirage of safety dissolving”) slightly dull momentum. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, preserving clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff (e.g., “sedimentary layers of silt… form a map that could revive the city’s forgotten irrigation”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (water as carrier of memory, cog as heartbeat) and pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“dissect doctrine without surrendering to complacency”) slightly dulls momentum, but closure beat (“competing narratives now share a common pulse”) is razor-sharp. Zero loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports cadence shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“threading golden threads through a tapestry of silence”—but avoids purple overload. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “vanishing arts” appears three times in close proximity with slight rewording, mildly redundant. Figurative coherence holds—roses, threads, chains all align tonally. Final third remains artifact-free; no filter-verb stacks or scaffold. High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, each sentence advancing atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (vines “pulse,” rust turns to “ruby veins”) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“neural clusters that glowed amber”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves with resonant propulsion, tying comet light to humming garden without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“amber veins,” “electric nectar,” “honeyed light”—but avoids overwriting; each metaphor serves atmosphere or theme. Sentence openings vary (“When the city-wide blackout…”, “Inside the keeper’s…”, “Mara knew…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One minor slip: “tasting the nectar dusk” slightly strains the taste/light synesthesia, but it’s consistent with the established sensory logic. No loops, redundancies, or scaffold; every line advances character, setting, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled; figurative density occasionally risks overload (“streetlights daydream,” “ember that could not be named,” “hushed blaze” in close proximity). However, metaphors cohere within the story’s logic—silence as tangible, radiant force—and no mixed vehicles disrupt clarity. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every line advances atmosphere or character. Minor scaffold in “each becoming a conduit for the quiet” slightly paraphrases prior action, but propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but most metaphors cohere within the underwater sacred-space logic (kelp as choir, ampoule as chalice, dome as vaulted mind). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“cascading revelations unfurled like tides” / “each knot a revelation”) and “incisively kind” appears three times as label rather than dramatization—minor loops that slightly blunt momentum. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, and sentence variety supports cadence shifts. High information density maintained, though one or two purple flourishes flirt with opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery but avoids overwriting; figurative language serves concept (“marble arches like a sigh of relief”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and information density is high (e.g., “deliberate imbalance that paradoxically stabilized the motion”). Minor scaffold in “boundless confinement” repetition (lines 1, 12, 20) slightly dulls uniqueness but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; final lines (“perpetual promise whispered through stone”) resolve with charged resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but mostly disciplined—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. High information density: “soot-stained glass lantern,” “silvered sap that seemed to capture the moon itself.” Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“patient hymn to the lost tongues,” “visual lexicon of remembrance”), slightly diluting propulsion. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s “saffron hush” and “secret hymn” risk abstraction but earn resonance through prior grounding. Read-aloud rhythm is supple and varied.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting risks clarity (“rosewater dread that clung to every stone,” “stone veins glowing with revived talent”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (e.g., climax), flirting with density penalties. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and information multi-tasks (scent both evokes memory and triggers mural reawakening). Final line’s “coldest grotto can bloom” slightly edges toward aphorism but earns its place through accumulated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “ocean seemed to inhale and release its breath” merges atmosphere with action. Figurative language is coherent (tide as breath, stone as dying star), though “latent radiance” appears four times—bordering on redundancy. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences summarize engine activation (“gears coughed… sound resonated”), slightly flattening climax. Final line (“vanished into the mist”) earns its lyricism without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“lingering luminance,” “photographically cursed”) and pays off. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“repulsive allure that made the air taste of copper and rot” echoes too closely with later “sweet rot”), but no loops or scaffold. Closure beat remains sharp and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting blurs clarity—e.g., “fractal generating patterns, a cascade of echoing loops that mirrored the branching outlines of the clouds” risks figurative overload. Sentence openings vary well; rhythm breathes with the sea’s pulse. Minor paraphrase loop: “turning the shifting vapor into melodies that only the wind could hear” / “mapped those changes onto the mallet’s strike, a silent diagram becoming audible.” Closure beat remains lucid despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “bronze ribs of iron that once opened…” conveys history, function, and decay). Figurative language is coherent—shell as text, city as fossil—and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy in “spiraled outward… echoing the very growth” slightly dulls momentum, but rhythm varies effectively, and the final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“glass fragments of fractured memories,” “steam from old locomotives”—and avoids paraphrase loops. However, figurative language occasionally overloads: “green veins that pulsed with forgotten journeys” followed by “cathedral naves” and “gilded narrative” risks stacked metaphor. Sentence openings vary well, but a few peak-beat lines verge on purple (“truth itself were pulling the darkness back”). Momentum holds, yet minor overwriting prevents 9+ line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “hushed blaze of damp copper,” “skeletal fingers” risk purple prose in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops (“interlaced absence” repeated without deepening). Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate, yet figurative density sometimes blurs cause/effect (e.g., ink “bleeding… sealing them with quiet fire” muddles physical action). Final paragraph’s cadence sings, but mid-story has slight syntactic monotony in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally overwritten: “water-worn marble shelves held volumes that had never seen daylight” borders on purple. Minor scaffold in “reclaimed stillness” repetition (used 4 times), slightly diluting impact. Sentence openings vary well; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Final lines earn their lyricism, but “logical page indexer could map a world back to its heart” edges toward abstraction. No fatal loops or artifacts, but two adjacent sentences restate “honest origins” near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“glass envelope thin as a sigh,” “paper veins lit by dream-light”—but avoids overwriting through rhythmic variation and concrete verbs. Minor redundancy in “luminous torment” (used twice) and slight metaphor stacking (“fireflies into cages of crystal” → “filaments that glow brighter than any candle”) prevent a 9+. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening sunrise, closing the textural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “circuit breakers cooled… hissing like dying beasts” conveys sound, state, and metaphor). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “intangibly tangible” repeats as a near-tautology, and “unfiltered awakening” verges on diagnostic label-speak. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density occasionally risks muddle—still, clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“star trails rippling with forgotten frequencies,” “distant sunrise trapped inside stone”), but occasional overwriting blurs clarity: “brilliant dimness” recurs as near-paradox without evolving function. Minor scaffold in middle (“each step pulled... as if star trails tugged”) slightly slows momentum. No loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Closure beat avoids artifacts, though “perpetually surprised” borders on label-speak without embodied tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line, but occasionally overwrites: “sieved hush” appears three times with diminishing returns, and phrases like “tempered regret” flirt with abstraction. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and no scaffold loops. However, the final paragraph’s “metronome of redemption” risks purple prose, slightly dulling the closure’s rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: “storm‑worn, windblown parapet,” “weather‑worn resolve,” “rain‑soaked eyes” verge on purple prose. Repetition of “furrowed hush” (three times) and “untether” (four times) creates scaffold loops. Mixed metaphor in “hinge between ruin and redemption” clashes with “compass pointing toward peace.” Final paragraph’s “collective sigh” rescues momentum, but density often sacrifices clarity for ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “merrily melancholic,” “flickering faith,” “ragged edges of his past” verge on label-speak. Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacking in key beats (“kayak cut through water like a pen across paper… drafting a narrative of redemption”). While beautiful, this risks purple prose; the compass “whispering north” and regrets as “tidal wave” border on mixed metaphor. Momentum holds, but scaffold phrases (“felt an instinctive gravitate,” “echoed his intention”) dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “delicately robust” modifying both lock and promise). Figurative language is pattern-taught (bioluminescence as emotional barometer) and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold appears in “dirty ledger of betrayals… kind of lies that stained…”—slight paraphrase loop—but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully syncs heartbeat and bioluminescence, earning closure propulsion. No filter-verb stacks or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (silvered mist, filament of starlight) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“air curled like a filament of starlight… forest itself inhaled”) edges toward density overload but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly modulates closure’s tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery but avoids overwriting: most figurative language serves the Accumulative lens without muddling cause/effect. Minor artifact: slight synonym churn in “choking beauty” (lines 12 and 30)—repeated without deepening. Otherwise, high information density, syntactic variety, and propulsion hold. Final paragraph’s “vanished into the clouds” resolves with rhythmic grace, echoing earlier motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—“mournful fireflies,” “sunrise on a blackened sea”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“shadows receding as if reluctant to be exposed”) edges toward abstraction, but closure remains sharp. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with passive constructions (“would welcome all”), costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “smoldering amber,” “velvet black,” “midnight oil” risk stacked modifiers. A paraphrase loop occurs in “whispering hush” / “vibrant hush” / “whispering hush” across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final paragraph tightens effectively, though “miracle aligning” leans toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “cascade of invisible currents that fluttered through the fort’s veins” risk abstraction despite strong verbs. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (sundial decoding, cradle activation), slightly blurring causality. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve momentum. Final line’s payoff (“quiet thunder without ever hearing a shot”) justifies the lyric investment, though tighter pruning could elevate clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with poetic precision but avoids purple excess; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary, rhythm mirrors tide and ritual. However, slight paraphrase loops appear (“borrowed dawn” repeated four times; “promise” invoked seven times), and the final paragraph leans on conceptual redundancy (“beacon,” “map,” “promise” echoing without new pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language serves momentum (“clouds churned like ink,” “storm’s teeth”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“map he could finally see… cartography of pain and redemption”) borders on redundancy, but closure remains sharp. No loops, no scaffold—just one near-paraphrase that costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally overwhelming propulsion (“mechanized arm whirring down like a sigh” risks cliché). Minor paraphrase loops: “dignified chaos” appears three times; “coded angles” repeated without escalation. Final paragraph’s “secret promise to those who would listen” edges toward abstraction. Yet rhythm varies skillfully, and key images carry high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally overwrought (“moon’s silver glaze turning rusted iron into veins of light”). A paraphrase loop appears: “rebuild the shattered world from the ashes of anarchy” later becomes “forge beauty from anarchy.” Still, rhythm varies purposefully, and every sentence advances atmosphere or theme. Final image (“luminous fracture stitched into the night”) avoids sentimentality through concrete stitching metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. However, figurative language occasionally overloads key beats (“tidal arbor swayed, its roots tangled in vapor, leaves shimmering like silver rain” followed immediately by “flickering compasses that pulsed…”), risking density over clarity. Minor scaffold in repeated “steely longing” phrasing. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but mid-story has slight synonym churn (“refuge,” “sanctuary,” “auditorium”). Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, though some sentences stack modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“lanterns flickering like questions”) and pays off in glyph-like shadows. Minor overwriting in “silvered pages turning in a wind of thought” risks abstraction, but clarity holds. No loops, no scaffold—only one near-redundancy (“fragile shoots before they touched sun” / “before it falls”) barely dents momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: metaphors stack (“lace instructions,” “sea of memory,” “cerulean regret”) without always clarifying. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“rhythmically placid” repeats four times; “tides of remembrance” three), dulling momentum slightly. Yet rhythm varies effectively near the end, and key images (compass on stone, shells as lanterns) carry high information density. Closure beat avoids artifacts, preserving emotional clarity despite ornamental density earlier.
