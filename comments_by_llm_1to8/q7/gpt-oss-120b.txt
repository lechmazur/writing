  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "decay never truly ends, it only cycles" restates earlier observations about gradual change. Template phrasing appears in "She began...She recorded...She realized...She wrote." The metaphor mixing of greenhouse as "wounded beast," "quiet laboratory," "tomb," and "breathing sanctuary" creates coherence issues without clear progression.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe template cadence throughout: "She [verb]" opens most sentences, creating monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops ("drifting resonance" appears 4 times unchanged) and overwrought figurative language in nearly every sentence ("glass towers," "black snow," "amber light") obscure rather than clarify. The final third particularly suffers from synonym churn around the same concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clean with good rhythm variation, but suffers from overwriting in places ("crimson for fear, azure for longing" feels forced). Several instances of telling rather than showing ("understanding that her survival was more than staying afloat") and some redundant phrasing reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("water pressed against its glass walls like a patient sigh") but suffers from repetition—"permanent address" appears four times, "chased stillness" three times without variation. Abstract phrases like "occupying impossible spaces" and "the very concept of rest" lack concrete grounding. The final paragraph loops similar ideas about memory and forgetting without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting dulls momentum: nearly every sentence contains figurative language ("voice a low drum," "silent spine," "curled like smoke") without pattern or payoff. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions, and abstract descriptors ("amplified quiet," "gently persistent rhythm") replace concrete action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose rhythm varies appropriately, accelerating during discovery and slowing for reflection. However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy ("felt the pilgrimage complete, yet open to new sparks"). Some figurative language feels forced ("sleeping dragon," "lantern" chest). The piece maintains momentum despite occasional overwriting, with strong opening and closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language in most sentences ("living sine wave," "Möbius strip of foliage," "trembling fabric") without pattern-teaching or payoff (-0.7). Abstract constructions like "texture of time" and "quaking reverie" obscure concrete action. Template phrases like "Mara understood," "Mara felt," "She believed" create filter-verb accumulation (-0.5).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in places ("skeletal witnesses to laughter long forgotten," "descended into the earth like a forgotten throat") and some template phrasing ("With each step," "She realized," "She understood"). The final third improves with cleaner action sequences, but figurative density in non-pressure moments dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "Mara" appears 14 times creating template cadence; phrases like "she returned to the greenhouse" and "she returned to the forge" loop without variation. Mixed metaphors strain clarity ("forge inhaled the void," "aurora's light turned the void into...lullaby"). The prose achieves moments of striking imagery but scaffold structures and paraphrase loops ("memory itself is a forge" / "memory remains the bridge") dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, but suffers from overwriting in places: "photon seemed to remember the illuminated moments" strains credibility. Template phrases appear ("heart raced," "eyes widening"). The recurring "illuminated moments" risks becoming repetitive rather than resonant. Several metaphors compete without integration.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive figurative density weighs down momentum—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or simile ("frozen veins opened like veins of glass," "pooled like liquid glass," "weighty lightness"). Template repetition appears in "she + verb" constructions and the phrase "weighty lightness" recurs three times, creating loop artifacts that dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density serves the lyric mode but occasionally tips into overwriting—"the library's cracked dome let in constellations that seemed to chart a map of forgotten stories" could shed modifiers. Template phrasing appears ("I sensed," "I realized," "I felt") and some metaphors strain (library bones "groaning" then "sighing"). The transformation sequence maintains clarity despite ornate language.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "ambered hush" appears 5 times, "marbled hush" 4 times, creating synonym churn rather than deepening. Template cadence runs ("He knew... He sensed... He answered...") and abstract constructions ("silence held the geometry of night") dull propulsion despite atmospheric prose.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "quiet awe"/"quiet work," "remarkably composed" appearing twice identically, and the redundant explanation that droplets "marking the passage of each looped timeline" after already establishing the melting-time connection. The prose achieves moments of clarity but suffers from overwriting in figurative density ("each droplet fell like a tiny comet") without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant overwriting throughout with mixed metaphors and purple prose ("crystal whispering forecourt," "chorus of murmurs that felt like words after words become unnecessary"). Template repetition of "ambiguously clear" without earned payoff. Paraphrase loops evident in the repeated descriptions of transparency and honesty. The prose often obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract density ("blooming withering," "tentative bloom," "measured steps") and repetitive figurative constructions. Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("He lifted...He whispered...He sensed...He knelt"). The phrase "commemorating small victories elaborately" reads as awkward construction that disrupts flow. Information density is moderate but clarity diminishes under accumulated abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy overwriting throughout with mixed metaphors ("violin bow on frozen strings"), redundant modifiers ("icy warmth" repeated), and paraphrase loops ("mechanically warm"/"warmly mechanical"). The prose prioritizes atmospheric density over clarity, with nearly every sentence containing figurative language that obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, particularly in descriptive passages. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "wordless conversation" repeats unnecessarily, "trembling" appears twice in the opening sentence, and phrases like "silence that had been trapped between sorrow and silence" create redundancy. The extended metaphorical language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts ("swaying certainties" appears 3 times, "auroral sorrow" 3 times, "occupying margins" twice). Some sentences strain for effect: "the fault-tolerant oracle named Mirela" reads as forced exposition rather than organic introduction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe paraphrase loops pervade: "drowsy alertness" appears four times, "ghost shift" six times, "swallowed truth" repeatedly without variation. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity ("confession that had cracked the night," "steel ribs," "frozen syllables"). Template cadence runs throughout ("He descended...He listened...He chose...He emerged"). The final third especially suffers from abstract diction ("emotional tonnage," "frequency chart of guilt") that obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("walls had thickened with moss" while "regenerative silence healed broken thoughts") and elevated diction throughout. Template patterns appear: "He sensed...He stepped...He understood...He wrote...He rose." The phrase "regenerative silence" repeats five times without variation, creating synonym churn rather than accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with figurative language in most sentences ("clouded moon," "breath of the earth," "cradling the sky like hands") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering -0.6. Template cadence appears in the final third with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions (-0.4). The extended metaphors about roots dreaming and oaks cradling create coherence issues without clear vehicle logic (-0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose achieves atmospheric density with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, abstract modifiers proliferate ("bronze quiet rhythm," "bronze quiet glow," "bronze quiet cadence"), creating a repetitive template pattern that dulls immediacy. Some phrases approach purple prose ("whispers of forgotten texts," "ash of centuries") without advancing specific meaning. The paraphrase loop between "stories walls have heard" appearing twice verbatim triggers additional deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("mirror that reflected," "transpose life into a new key") and abstract conceptual language that obscures rather than clarifies. Template cadence appears in repetitive "He [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes elevated diction over clarity, with phrases like "conspiratorial accomplice" and "forged key of humanity" that strain for profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "dimensional anchor" (4x), "loop pedal priest" (5x), "decorated with silence" (3x) create mechanical loops. Abstract phrases like "unraveling of stillness" and "muffled clarity" recur without gaining specificity. The prose relies heavily on abstract mystical language ("resonant currents," "fragile equilibrium") that reduces clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Deductions for overwriting in places ("intangible corridors of time," "phosphorescent memory"), some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy, and occasional template structures ("She felt...She reached...She whispered"). The final paragraph maintains momentum despite length.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from density overload with figurative language in nearly every sentence ("darkening brightness," "periodically eternal," "fractured timelines flickering like broken mirrors"). Template mystical phrasings ("the world sighed," "time itself paused to listen") and abstract constructions impede momentum, though the recursive structure around "drop and ripple" provides some coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Significant overwriting issues include density problems (nearly every sentence contains figurative language), mixed metaphors ("filament of hush" as both thread and light), and register drift into elevated diction. Template cadence appears in "She lifted...She smiled...She returned." The prose achieves moments of clarity but struggles with consistent opacity that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "layered tranquility" appears five times, "quiet courtyard at dusk" four times, creating template cadence. Overwriting in places ("bruised violet," "whispered secrets," "sediment in a calm lake") without sufficient precision. The prose achieves moments of clarity but suffers from redundant abstractions and conceptual loops that reduce momentum, particularly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dense figurative language overwhelms several sentences ("crystal shadows of the greenhouse cling to his coat like silent witnesses"). Multiple metaphor vehicles compete without coherence. However, the prose maintains momentum and avoids loops or scaffolding. The writing is overwrought but not technically flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: "terra-cotta grotto under starlight," "passionate subtlety that flavored every line," "the very marrow of the universe." Mixed metaphors clash—rope as compass rose, as memory, as time itself. Template cadence appears in "He began...By uncovering...As he followed" structure. The paraphrase loop in the final paragraph ("most profound discoveries"/"dare to untangle") confirms systematic prose debt that caps this below 5.0.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern or payoff ("skeletal guardians," "crackling tongues of flame," "tide seeking a hidden shore"). Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. Lines often restate rather than advance, as in the redundant final two paragraphs that circle the same "unfinished beauty" concept. Information density is low despite the ornate language.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. Multiple sentences begin with "She" or "Mara," creating template cadence. Phrases like "subsume the ambient sentiment" and "measured calculations" lean abstract where concrete action would sharpen. The piece lacks sentence-level propulsion despite evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe overwriting throughout: "breezy library under stars opened its doors to readers who whispered between shelves, their breaths stirring the scented pages" exemplifies the ornamental density that pervades without advancing story. Template phrases accumulate ("cautious exuberance" appears three times). Mixed metaphors muddle sense: "swirling like sea breezes, ready to negotiate...the flow of kindness." Information density is low despite verbose presentation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.1)
    Overwriting pervades the piece - nearly every sentence contains figurative language ("midnight lighthouse," "ribbons of violet," "canvas of trembling stars"). The prose relies on abstract descriptors ("luminescent ache" appears four times) and conceptual redundancy (multiple variations on connection/binding). Template structures repeat: "Arlen [verb]," "The villagers [verb]," creating rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: "coax the soul from a fossil and paint it with breath," "sculpte time itself into visible patterns," "uncage the very notion of linear time." Abstract proclamations ("borrow time from the future to fuel her quest") replace concrete action. Template mystical phrasing pervades: "whispers," "echoes," "resonated," creating formulaic fantasy prose.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwritten with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("silver shadows," "pale lanterns," "amber fog"). Multiple paraphrase loops: "ambiguous loss" repeated verbatim three times; "buried optimism" appears twice. Template cadence in "He carried...He placed...He traced...He walked." The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("exhaled a cool breath of dust and ink") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("methodical kindness," "collective yearning") and occasional redundancy (multiple uses of "sapphire hush"). The template phrase "visible to those who need you" appears three times unchanged, creating mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant template cadence issues ("He decided...He placed...He watched...He remembered...He documented...He felt") and repetitive phrasing of key concepts reduce momentum. The prose achieves moments of lyrical precision but suffers from paraphrase loops, particularly around "releasing control" and "reluctant metamorphosis" which appear unchanged multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("a sky that seemed perpetually bruised") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Several template constructions appear ("She felt...," "She realized...," "She knew...") that dull immediacy. The paraphrase loop between "exchange fulfilled" and "exchange was complete" in the final paragraphs weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive repetition plagues the prose: "overlapping shadows" appears 6 times, "bright darkness" 7 times, "unseen forces" 6 times, creating synonym loops rather than deepening meaning. Template cadence runs throughout ("She laughs, and the laughter..."; "The cave pearl responds...turning them into..."). Information density suffers from paraphrase loops like "inviting all who wander to step into its music" followed immediately by restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm and imagery, though some sentences stretch too long for optimal clarity. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme simultaneously. Minor issues: "the harbor, now quiet after the rain" echoes the opening too directly; "staggered intervals" appears twice without evolution. The extended ending sequence could tighten without losing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "trembling certainty" appears twice, "starlit vault in mist" repeats verbatim, and multiple sentences begin with "She" creating template cadence. The prose tends toward the overwrought ("ghostly impression shimmering," "skeletal fingers," "colossal eye") without the precision that would make these flourishes feel necessary. Several paraphrase loops occur, such as the redundant explanation that the fortress "was not a place of stone, but a living archive" followed immediately by restating this concept.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density occasionally overwhelms clarity with stacked modifiers ("the unheard symphony of the whales' low calls filtered through the tower's crystal panes"). Several run-on sentences blur momentum. Information density is high but sometimes sacrifices propulsion for ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("Each particle a tiny echo of a goodbye") but suffers from abstract density in places. Phrases like "dimensionally aware" and "Euclidean logic" feel more conceptual than embodied. Some repetition of "magnetic" (11 instances) and "prismatic" (5) creates mild echo without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("living calculus of moral exchange," "visible expression of the mathematics"), and the metaphorical density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, but suffers from paraphrase loops ("invented histories" concept restated in variations) and occasional overwriting in figurative density. Template cadence appears in "He would... He noted... He rose" progression, though rhythm varies effectively elsewhere. The closing achieves propulsion despite these frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm and varied syntax, though some figurative density approaches overwriting ("rusted bones," "thin paper," "cold filament" in close succession). Information density generally high with purposeful compression. Deduct -0.5 for repetitive "erased histories" phrase and -0.2 for slight template cadence in middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues throughout: mixed metaphors ("whisper of closing pages" becomes "wind...turn each cracked window pane into a page-turn"), repetitive phrasing ("resonant hums" appears multiple times), and purple prose that prioritizes atmosphere over clarity. The line "gloomy cheerfulness" exemplifies the forced oxymorons that weaken precision. Information density is compromised by decorative language that doesn't advance story.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful variation in sentence length and structure. Some passages show strong density ("Every night, under the hopeful desperation that rose like steam from the river"). However, several instances of telling over showing ("Mira's dual allegiance tugged her heart") and some scaffolding phrases ("Meanwhile, the private investors") reduce momentum. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades peak moments: "dawning hush" appears four times, creating a template loop; abstract descriptors like "melancholy of dawn" and "breath of the world before sunrise" lack concrete grounding. The whispered speech contains three consecutive sentences beginning with "May," creating rhythmic monotony. Information density suffers from paraphrase loops ("soft wind stirred the dust" followed immediately by "world seemed to hold its sigh").

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose flows with varied sentence lengths and sensory specificity ("soft hum rose from the drone, signaling that the patch held"). However, "magnetic calm" appears three times, creating unnecessary repetition. The final two paragraphs contain abstract philosophizing ("each repaired wing was a promise to the world") that dilutes the concrete imagery. Some filter constructions ("Mara felt," "She listened") could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece. However, abstract constructions accumulate: "worrying tranquility," "calm that bordered on dread," "the kind that foretells change." Some paraphrase loops appear: "singular convergence" repeated four times, emotional states restated ("terrifying and hopeful" echoes earlier "worrying tranquility").

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting pervades with phrases like "whispered of forgotten festivals" and "the silent weight of architecture," creating purple prose that obscures clarity. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("He placed...He whispered...He turned"). However, the piece maintains readable momentum and some effective images like "footsteps on cobblestones that had not yet been laid."

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues undermine prose quality: "crystal perfume vial" appears 11 times, "gathered hush" 8 times, creating mechanical loops rather than purposeful pattern. Template cadence pervades ("Mara felt," "Mara inhaled," "Mara realized"). Mixed metaphors ("unsnarl the tight coil") and abstract phrases ("lonesome splendor") obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "copperlight repose" appears four times, "lattice from confessional" three times, "cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son" three times, "scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" twice verbatim. Mixed metaphors ("lighthouse prison...breathing," "lattice...sustaining impossibilities") and abstract phrases like "thread a labyrinth with your own story" create opacity rather than clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy figurative density creates overwriting issues—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated imagery without pattern-teaching payoff. Multiple paraphrase loops ("resonant awakenings"/"resonant awakening" repeated; "mournful elation" used twice identically). Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetitive phrasing and synonym loops pervade: "orchid solace"/"orchid breeze"/"orchid-soft hands," multiple uses of "sew/sewn," "broken precedents" repeated verbatim. Template cadence appears in "She began to sew... She whispered to the walls... She understood that..." Register drift into abstract poeticism ("quiet awe," "luminous canopy") dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues pervade: "diaspora returnee" appears 4 times, "purposeful wandering" 3 times, "interrupted journeys" 3 times, creating mechanical echo rather than purposeful accumulation. Template cadence runs ("She walked...She remembered...She felt...") and abstract descriptors ("cautious enchantment," "quiet gratitude") replace concrete specificity. The final third particularly suffers from paraphrase loops about faith restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    Severe overwriting pervades: "golden arcade at dawn" appears three times, extensive metaphor chains blur sense ("courier—a drone woven from recycled arcade circuitry"), and abstract phrases like "transmission of marginal thoughts" and "lattice of light" accumulate without concrete grounding. Template phrases ("In that moment," "And in that golden dawn") scaffold transitions. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "echoed silence" appears three times with minimal variation, and the conspiracy revelation repeats across lines 19-24 without advancing. Template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions, though figurative language generally coheres within the mystical register.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.4)
    Repetitive phrasing plagues the text: "fierce tenderness" appears 6 times, "unsent letters" 7 times, constant "glowing/shimmering/silver" descriptions. Template cadence runs throughout ("She [verb], the [noun] [verb]"). Overwriting with mixed metaphors: roots as "whispered verses" and "soft hands," spirits that are both "floating" and creating "roars."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("mist clung," "twilight draped," "violet hue" in the opening alone) and abstract constructions like "shared anxieties" repeated without variation. The prose achieves moments of clarity ("I am scared of night because the sky is a cracked mirror of bombs") but suffers from density without propulsion—many sentences describe states rather than advance action.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades with figurative language in most sentences ("walls soon sang with color," "trembling like chandeliers"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around light/joy concepts. Template cadence runs through "She [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes poetic effect over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant template cadence runs ("She + verb" appears in 8 consecutive sentences mid-story) and paraphrase loops ("nested awakenings" concept restated multiple times) drain momentum. Abstract noun chains ("cascade of miniature auroras that painted the garden walls") and filter-verb clusters in peak beats ("She realized," "she felt," "she saw") create distance. The prose reaches for lyrical density but achieves opacity instead.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.3)
    Multiple instances of overwriting blur clarity: "converging chaos into a single, luminous thread that stitched the hidden language into the very walls" strains comprehension. Paraphrase loops appear ("secret language club" restated as "the Loom" repeatedly). The prose prioritizes atmospheric density over narrative momentum, with several sentences doing decorative rather than functional work.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("moon painted silver veins," "sugar in brine," "luminous language"). Mixed metaphors clash (photosynthesis/coral/galaxy/garden within paragraphs). Template cadence appears in repetitive "He [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes ornamental description over clarity and momentum, with the density of figurative language obscuring rather than illuminating the narrative progression.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dense figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching ("foxglove regret," "violet sorrow," "glass-orchid petal" comparisons), creating overwriting issues. Template cadence runs appear: multiple "She [verb]" constructions in sequence. Information density is high and the piece maintains momentum, but the elevated diction and metaphor density (-0.7) significantly impact clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing around promises/glyphs/symphonies and abstract descriptors ("urgent melody," "fragile chord"). Template cadence appears in "She traced...She felt...She moved...She wrote." Mixed metaphors (ink singing/symphony/heartbeat) create figurative muddle without clear vehicle consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues pervade: "The chain had been gifted with an encrypted compassion" anthropomorphizes awkwardly; "slyly heartfelt" and "dappled resolve" read as forced poeticism. Template constructions like "She felt...She imagined...She logged" create mechanical rhythm, while mixed metaphors (chain as "living ledger," water as "sapphire thread") muddle clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "paper trails" appears 7 times with minimal variation; "lost songs" recurs 4 times without deepening. Lines like "She believed that preserving these trails could echo the lost songs" followed immediately by similar sentiment create redundancy. The prose achieves moments of beauty but suffers from conceptual repetition that dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "necessary distances" appears five times with minimal variation; "fractured hush" repeats without evolution. Template cadence runs ("He recalled...He moved...He followed...He realized...He turned") create mechanical progression. Abstract phrasing like "featherly determined resolve of his lineage" obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "shadowseam wonder," "softly ingenious" steps as "a question whispered to the deep," walls that "seemed to breathe a soft lullaby." Template cadence appears in runs of "She [verb]" constructions. The phrase "luminous respite" repeats mechanically, and abstract descriptors ("forgotten tides," "shared exhale of wonder") replace concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language ("kaleidoscopic shadows," "melancholy teal," "rose-colored sigh") that prioritizes atmosphere over momentum. Template patterns appear in discovery sequences ("Maren placed...the crater glass...") creating repetitive cadence. The prose achieves mood but at the cost of propulsion, with multiple paraphrase loops around the emotional color translations.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.4)
    Overwriting pervades with figurative language in most sentences ("tide-lit boards," "collapsed into a perfect fragment," "beacon"). Template cadence appears in "He lifted...He placed...He whispered" sequences. The phrase "calculated wilderness" repeats exactly, creating paraphrase loop. Register stays elevated beyond natural speech throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple instances of paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "elective exile"/"voluntarily imposed distance," "obsidian grace" repeated verbatim, and conceptual redundancy in describing the moonstone's properties. The prose relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("cosmic verse," "universal speech") rather than concrete imagery, though some specific moments ("ink spread...each curl swallowing the darkness") show stronger craft.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetition issues pervade the text: "clear complexity" appears three times, "noctilucent" four times, "read between lines" three times, creating a loop effect rather than purposeful pattern. Multiple sentences restate the same content ("She reminded herself that the purpose of this ritual was to illuminate value in the mundane, to show that even a tossed stone could speak of hidden worth" followed immediately by similar assertions). The prose favors abstract descriptors over concrete detail, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive overwriting with metaphorical density in most sentences ("moonlight scattered into delicate shards of memory," "stitching wounds with silence," "hard softness"). Multiple paraphrase loops, especially around the bargain concept. Template cadence runs ("She whispered...She lifted...She felt...She realized").

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("kaleidoscope of potential," "living ledger") with good rhythmic variation. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("revitalize the community's faith"/"revitalize the city"), and some sentences strain with elevated diction. The line "stitch equations into the very fabric of hope" pushes metaphor toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Strong moments like "ghostly silhouettes of arches and doorways, each line echoing a tone" show precise imagery. However, abstract phrases accumulate ("shared responsibility to honor those silent reveries," "collective imagination that lives in every stone whisper") and the extended ending relies on summary rather than scene. Some metaphor mixing occurs between walls as dreamers and walls as histories.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "borrowed heartbeat" appears 6 times, "dusky harmony" 3 times, "coded lullabies" 4 times, creating loops rather than progression. Template cadence pervades ("He watched... He whispered... He moved..."). The elevated diction ("prism parapet," "elusive mirage painter") feels forced rather than voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around redemption/reconciliation concepts and overwrought figurative language ("celestial choreography," "parched hearts of warriors"). Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("price of redemption" variations, "operatively gentle" repetitions). Some effective imagery fights against purple prose tendencies and conceptual redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("a sound like a thousand whispered wings"), it suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Phrases like "amoral grace that left no lasting trace yet reshaped the world" and multiple metaphors for the salt flat create ornamental excess that occasionally obscures momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose achieves moments of rhythmic control ("The air tasted of ice and ink"). However, abstract phrases proliferate ("bodily poetic rhythm," "alarming serenity," "quiet hymn") without concrete grounding. Template cadence appears in "She sensed... She felt... She had heard..." sequence, and figurative density overwhelms peak beats without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("meteor hush," "campfire story stick," "strings of conscience unspooling like ribbons of starlight") that prioritize ornament over clarity. Template cadence appears in "She lifted...She imagined...She let..." sequences, and abstract phrases like "ethical wonder" and "soft, half-lit chorus of truth" blur rather than sharpen meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose in nearly every sentence - "verdant grotto suspended above the clouds," "orange whispers," "soft incense toward the heavens." Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. The density of figurative language obscures rather than clarifies the action, particularly in peak moments like "each heartbeat matching the butterfly's wingbeat."

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing around "forgotten names" (appears 7 times) and "snowmelt ardor" (twice), creating mild synonym churn. Some sentences carry ornate figurative language that slows momentum: "curtains dancing faster, painting the ceiling with colors that melted the last remnants of winter's grip." The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with transformation, though middle sections could achieve higher density by cutting scaffold phrases like "simple yet profound."

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("vine-draped bunker waited like a breathing relic") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without sufficient breathing room. Phrases like "the forest's heartbeat" and "sentient filament" accumulate without clear differentiation. The repetition of "precisely playful" feels forced rather than pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from density without clarity—nearly every sentence contains figurative language that accumulates without advancing story. Template constructions appear: "Nabu traced...," "Nabu hoped...," "Nabu returned..." Filter-verb stacks and abstract phrasing ("empirically ironic calculations can uncloak devotion") create distance. The closing runs particularly purple with "bridge to eternity" and "perpetual note of dusky harmony."

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with density issues: "the sanctuary, carved from obsidian stone, absorbed every echo, leaving the world outside a muted mural of shifting grace" packs too many modifiers. Template repetition appears in the monk transformation sequence. However, key images like the reappearing pin and cellular memory are vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.6)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "twilight frost shimmered brighter, each crystal facet reflecting the orchard's ghostly silhouettes." However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "erasing boundaries between reflection and reality"/"boundaries are merely shadows of fear" and repetitive "synchronized breathing"/"breathing as one" constructions dilute impact.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive template cadence ("She [verb]," "Lira [verb]," "Mira [verb]") creates monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "promises could bend like branches without breaking" immediately followed by similar renewal imagery. Overwriting in metaphorical density ("bruised with storm clouds," "choir onto the cracked quartz lenses") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("trees bent toward him, their blossoms shedding luminous pollen") but suffers from abstract repetition ("simply complicated" appears twice, "nonlinear inheritance" three times) and conceptual loops. The phrase "brightened disquiet" forces paradox without earning it through scene work. Some sentences meander with multiple clauses that dilute momentum, particularly in the middle bathroom sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dense but occasionally overwrought prose with phrases like "cathedral," "labyrinthine," "chrono-engine" creating texture at the expense of momentum. Several paraphrase loops appear ("rescue mission...rescue missions," "unheard symphony" repeated without evolution in early uses) and the extended single-paragraph structure challenges readability.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythm and varied syntax, though some figurative density approaches overwriting ("lighthouse born of ink"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Template phrase "She [verb]" appears 4+ times but doesn't create mechanical cadence due to varied continuation. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythmic variation, but several overwriting issues: "copper-glinting strands," "the cool breath of absence brush against her cheeks," and abstract constructions like "clarity thrives when the unknown is acknowledged." The filtering through "she understood" and "she knew" dulls immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "gently luminous" appears four times, "bloom of hush" three times, "hammered repose" three times, creating template cadence. Sentences frequently open with similar structures ("He had been waiting," "He knew that," "He began his work"). The prose achieves atmospheric density but at the cost of forward propulsion, with several passages that could be compressed without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "thistle-blown hope" appears four times, "glass humming pavilion" three times without variation, and multiple sentences begin with "I" + verb constructions. The prose relies on abstract assertions ("renewal is possible when old eyes learn new sight") rather than concrete imagery, though some phrases like "the beacon's flame safe, forever tracking the stars" achieve lyrical effect.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant paraphrase loops pervade: "deepening hush" appears four times, "preemptively nostalgic" twice, "sculpt identity from experience" three times. Template cadence runs like "He recorded...He imagined...He traced" create mechanical rhythm. Overwriting in phrases like "the observatory's lanterns flickered, casting a new set of shadows that danced like ancient verses" lacks propulsion and dilutes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("walls...stretched like silent witnesses," "night was a hush") and abstract descriptors replacing concrete action. Template cadence appears in "He sang...He lifted...He held...He released...He understood...He tucked...He walked...He vowed"—eight consecutive paragraph openings with identical structure. The prose prioritizes atmospheric density over clarity and momentum, creating opacity rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("She felt the pause in the conversation like a held breath, the moment before a storm of words" restates the same idea). Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" structures. Abstract phrasing like "texture of time" and "invisible lines that bind transition periods" lacks concrete imagery. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "sensed," "watched") distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("clouds brushed his cheeks like cool silk") with varied sentence rhythms. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "intangibly tangible" explained twice, multiple restatements of the silence-collection concept. Filter constructions ("Lio watched," "He realized") dull immediacy in peak moments. The "stretched contracted" construction strains comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but repetitive stems appear ("Lira felt," "Lira watched," "She felt"). The phrase "vaulting hush" recurs four times, and "in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" appears twice verbatim. These repetitions serve the accumulative mode but edge toward template cadence in places.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    Overwriting pervades peak moments ("cascade of pixelated rain, each drop a memory") without enhancing pressure, and abstract phrasing dulls key beats ("weight of histories," "gentle hum of unity"). The paraphrase loop in the final lines ("The story...would echo forever" followed by nearly identical sentiment) and template cadence ("She + verb" pattern) further reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("burned bridges carefully" appears twice verbatim) and abstract constructions that blur concrete action ("stitched darkness into the seams"). While individual sentences achieve poetic effect, overreliance on figurative language ("whisper of forgotten fires," "hollowed hall," "loaded emptiness") creates density without advancing story, particularly in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("seam of light thin as a thought") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most high-pressure sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in the "She claimed... She reminded..." sequence, and several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("glitchy text messages"/"glitchy texts"/"glitchy words").

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "eloquently silent" appears 4 times, "golden shadows" 5 times, "bridge of intuition" 5 times. Some overwriting in metaphors ("vibrations dancing like ribbons of light") and abstract telling ("his purpose fulfilled") that could be cut for stronger immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("copper vines exhaled vapor that glittered") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts—"murmured allegiance" appears 5 times, "forgotten patterns" 3 times, "shivering bliss" 3 times without sufficient variation. Some sentences strain under ornate construction ("factually mystical" reads as oxymoronic padding). Information density is high but momentum occasionally stalls in abstract passages.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose suffers from extensive paraphrase loops—"histories that refuse to die" echoes "stories that refuse to be forgotten" conceptually. Template cadence pervades ("She lifted...She set...She traced...She wrote"). Metaphorical density overwhelms clarity with dust simultaneously being "choreography," "filaments," "patterns," and "testament." The phrase "magnifying small kindnesses" repeats verbatim three times.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences flow with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, avoiding mechanical patterns. However, abstract phrasing proliferates ("dormant frequency," "coded freedom," "phantom fireflies") without sufficient grounding in physical specifics. Some conceptual redundancy appears in the closing third with variations on memory/resistance/indifference cycling without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues pervade the text: "radiant grotto in mist" appears verbatim three times, "as dewdrops form" twice, "vested hush" four times, "quietly vivid" three times. Template cadence runs ("He slipped...He raised...He played...He felt...He turned...He walked...He paused...He smiled") create monotonous rhythm. These artifacts touch the closure beat, capping all categories at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, avoiding mechanical patterns. However, several passages suffer from density overload ("ashen skyborne arbor," "mossy delight of centuries-old bark") and abstract phrasing ("the hush where past meets prophecy") that prioritizes atmosphere over clarity. The filter-verb stack "she would prod...nudging seedlings" and repetitive "monument" constructions reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density is high with most sentences advancing atmosphere or meaning, though some figurative language clusters heavily ("silvery sheets," "silver dust," "phosphorescent"). Template structures appear occasionally ("She collected...believing," "She placed...and waited"). The "uncertainly certain" construction and similar paradoxes risk becoming mannered but support the thematic core.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in sensory descriptions that advance both atmosphere and character state. Clear propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. Deductions for several abstract phrases ("invisible mass," "fragmented self-knowledge") and minor repetition around "weight" and "names" that borders on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("each confession a fragile thread of pain that shimmered like sunrise glass") but suffers from occasional overwriting. Some metaphors strain ("torn fabric of each lingering soul") and the repetition of "modestly fearless" feels mechanical rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive constructions plague key passages ("She braced herself...She braced again...She braced for the final surge"). Abstract language dominates concrete imagery, with concepts like "mathematics of mercy" and "geometry of compassion" creating semantic loops rather than advancing pressure. The filter-heavy construction ("feeling," "wondered," "realized") dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose rhythm varies effectively and supports the accumulative structure, but several instances of overwriting dilute impact: "elusively tangible balance," "forever the bridge," and repetitive "I realize" constructions. The density of figurative language in non-peak moments ("constellation of stories," "tide of memory") creates ornamental rather than functional imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with mixed metaphors ("flapped like a tired animal," "spiraling dance") and template constructions ("Mara's skillfully observant eyes," "engaged the barrel with the elevator's control circuit"). The prose prioritizes atmospheric density over clarity, creating momentum drag particularly in the investigation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant paraphrase loops damage momentum: "rustling awakening/awakenings" appears 7 times with minimal variation; "compress eternity into a moment" repeats 3 times verbatim. Template cadence pervades: "She [verb], [participial phrase]" structure dominates. Mixed metaphors clash (whisper is both "liquid darkness" and generates "rustling"). Information density suffers from ornamental description over advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades the text: "burnished sorrow" appears three times, template constructions like "She [verb], [participle]" recur, and abstract phrases like "catalyst for creation" and "symphony of mirrors" replace concrete imagery. The prose reaches for lyricism but achieves ornamental density without precision.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    While individual sentences show craft, the prose suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most high-pressure beats ("rust...like a garden of iron vines, each leaf shimmering"). Template cadence appears in sequential "He/Alder" constructions, and several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("The chamber brightened, amber light spilling" followed by "townsfolk below felt a sudden warmth").

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("liquid glass," "water trembling in the dark") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("hinged awakenings," "explanations fail") and some ornamental metaphors. Several instances of telling over showing ("She understood that...") and filter constructions weaken immediacy, particularly in the mystical sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "timewoven alliances" appears 4 times, "turbine-hum reverie" 4 times, "reimagine" 3 times, "layered meanings" 3 times, creating template-cadence loops. Abstract phrasing dominates ("scaffold complexity with simplicity") over concrete action. The prose privileges ornamental metaphor over clarity, with mixed vehicles (archway as throat, then portal, then studio).

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff ("amber light filtered through cracked panes, casting elongated shadows that danced with umbral tenderness"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the theme of "dawning hush" and winter/bloom imagery. The density obscures rather than clarifies key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong moments ("brass hull humming like a distant prayer") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Some phrases edge toward purple ("searing reverie turned into a resolve"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from overwriting and abstraction: "reimagined an entire civilization without a single false promise" tells rather than shows. Template cadence appears ("He imagined...He imagined...He rejected..."). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "revival was not a sudden surge but a patient bloom" restates without advancing. The writing prioritizes elevated diction over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some figurative language feels overstacked ("velvet disquiet," "brass now a memory"). Information unfolds cleanly despite complex syntax. Some paraphrase loops appear ("archive emotional patterns" concept restated), and register occasionally drifts purple in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves strong sensory density and figurative coherence ("looping time like a garden of perpetual bloom"). However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "furiously tranquil"/"storm of calm," "wild and serene"/"wild serenity," and the texture of borrowed time described similarly three times. Some filter constructions ("Mira felt," "She recalled," "felt the promise") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "laid aside like a retired hymn" and effective rhythm variation, but suffers from occasional redundancy ("humble storm siren tester" appears twice identically) and some overwriting in metaphorical density. Clarity remains strong through technical sequences, though phrases like "vortex toward the earth" and "ears yet untrained" edge toward purple prose. The piece maintains momentum but could benefit from tighter editing of ornamental phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, with evocative phrases like "luminous arcs across the firmament." However, abstract formulations ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance," "fertile ground") accumulate without sufficient grounding, and some redundancy appears between "hush of an overlooked era" used twice and overlapping descriptions of the janitor's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("ghosts become visible," "stained glass box that glowed with inner fire") with good syntactic variety. However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("mute eloquence," "contextual clues," "tangled covenant") without sufficient grounding, and some passages loop conceptually (the covenant is explained, then re-explained through different metaphors). The filter verb "He understood" appears twice in crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose shows strong moments like "the valley below seemed to inhale the future" but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphors appear ("lighthouse"/"antenna" for the silo). Template cadence emerges in the final third with repetitive "She/They" openings, and some phrases lean purple ("era-shifting chronicle," "timeless hymn").

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "woven dawns" appears 8 times, "burnished hush" 3 times, "kite string snaps" 3 times, "warmly attentive" 3 times. The phrase "by harmonizing discord" repeats verbatim. While some repetition serves the accumulative mode, this excessive recurrence creates loops rather than deepening. Template cadence appears in "He knelt...He decided...He placed...He lifted."

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.6)
    Several passages suffer from conceptual redundancy: "foster interspecies respect, letting humans hear the quiet language of trees and stones alike" essentially restates the same idea. Template phrasing appears in "She began at dawn" and "From that day forward." The prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("painted the sea with bruised amber") but relies heavily on abstract declarations about harmony and connection. Multiple filter constructions ("seemed to translate," "began to sketch," "began to pause") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues: dense figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff ("silvered sentinel," "bronze quiet fire," "chemical chorus"). Template cadence runs appear ("Arin realized... He whispered... He turned..."), and abstract constructions ("chemistry of homecoming") repeat without variation. The prose achieves atmosphere but sacrifices momentum to ornamental density.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    Template cadence pervades ("The coachman..." starts multiple sentences; "He [verb]" pattern repeats). Abstract phrasing like "narrow vastness" and "submerged concord" obscures concrete meaning, while paraphrase loops ("garden reclaiming the scarred ground" / "garden's reclamation") dilute momentum without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("horizon glowed with smoldered amber") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in the final third ("Rook felt... Rook settled... Rook knew").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff ("river of light," "glass cradle," "temporal field"). Template cadence emerges in the parallel "I [verb]" constructions across multiple sentences. The phrase "blessed pariah" repeats four times without evolving meaning, creating unnecessary loop.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has rhythm and variety, with strong imagery like "coat of midnight velvet stitched with silver threads that whispered of past heists." However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "cautious abandon" appears three times with minimal variation. Some sentences restate without advancing, particularly in the village return sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing multiple layers. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "to unbind the story...to let the memory flow" restates the same intent. Abstract phrasing like "tentative interregnum" and "luminous absence" occasionally obscures concrete action, though the pattern-walking sequences maintain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"mercury-glass seer named Lira drifted between aisles" establishes character, movement, and ethereal quality simultaneously. Some figurative excess appears ("cathedral," "marrow of bones," "night flowers") but serves the mythic register. Minor loops include "shape of home" repetition and adjacent concepts ("forgotten memories"/"buried talents"), though the pattern-teaching around resonance/vibration motifs largely succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with mixed metaphors ("frayed like old nerves," "platinum labyrinth," "woven hush") that compete rather than cohere. Template constructions appear throughout ("He remembered," "He recalled," "He knew"), and abstract phrases like "fierce repose" and "woven hush" become repetitive rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "refracted/refracting" appears 7 times, "echo/echoes/echoing" 8 times, creating synonym churn. Template cadence emerges in "Mara watched...She smiled...She turned" sequences. The prose achieves moments of lyricism but suffers from overwriting in figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery and rhythm, but several instances of abstract telling weaken momentum: "reminder that time itself was a fragile alloy," "bulwark of purpose against the void." Some metaphor density approaches overwriting ("frost under a furnace"). The piece maintains propulsion through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, though occasional abstraction ("the gentle acceptance of their own scars") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("the sea's sighs with colors that seemed to linger longer than the tides") but suffers from abstract phrasing and occasional overwriting. Template structures appear ("I reached out, my fingers trembling, and as I lifted...," "I recalled that night...," "I slipped the key...") creating predictable cadence. The density is uneven, with some sentences doing multiple jobs while others merely transit.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy figurative density clutters most sentences without payoff ("vapor curled," "luminous thread," "quiet chord"). Template repetition appears throughout ("She [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]"). The phrase "whispers travel farther than shouts" repeats four times, creating paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("antennae like skeletal ribs reaching toward the indifferent sky") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrases: "geography of loss" appears four times, "raw solace" twice. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("She understood...She watched...She recorded"). Some sentences could be cut without losing meaning, particularly the explanatory passages about reverse migration.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("hanging orchard swaying like a broken cathedral of fruit") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("old sorrow," "fragile safety blooming") and occasional register drift. Template cadence appears in "I saw...My plan required...I trekked" progression. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story but some philosophical passages ("In the fractured grace of that moment") slow momentum without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: "bruised lavender," "brittle petals a soft reminder," "hollow sigh of water" stack figurative language without clear purpose. Template repetition of "softly persistent" (3x) and paraphrase loops ("a silent request to remember, to keep the stranger's story alive") dull momentum. The abstract register ("nameless stranger," "fleeting hope") disconnects from concrete immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Some figurative density in places ("lingering promise tightened around his chest like a rope") and occasional abstraction ("empirically intuitive") create minor friction, but lines consistently advance atmosphere and meaning without significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose maintains consistent rhythm but suffers from overwriting—"bleeding starlight across her mind," "cobalt grotto above clouds," "lacy menace of the night." The repeated phrase "shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" creates an awkward template cadence. Mixed metaphors ("bleeding starlight," "wound" that "spills light") muddle clarity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive repetition creates loops: "ember nexus at twilight" appears 4 times, "returning differently" 4 times, "scientifically romantic" 2 times, "density of presence" 3 times, reducing momentum. Abstract phrasing like "directed spontaneity" and "palette of resolve" lacks concrete imagery. The prose achieves atmospheric consistency but sacrifices propulsion to ornamental description: "a mixture of powdered moonstone, crushed carnelian, and a whisper of sunrise."

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "feral nostalgia" appears three times with minimal variation, "jaded wonder" repeats without development, and the soaring metaphor cycles without progression. Template cadence emerges in "I [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The prose achieves moments of vivid imagery but sacrifices clarity to ornamental language ("chronologically confused mind jumps between").

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting pervades: "trembling calm," "reverent fingers," "whispered silhouette" cluster without earning their elevated register. Template constructions appear ("She moved...like," "She lifted...feeling," "She placed...now") and the prose relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("mapping emotional terrain," "conduit for love's first sigh") that obscure concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "breath between storms" (3x), "saturated hush" (2x), "held breath" variants, and multiple uses of "whispered." The prose relies heavily on abstract poeticisms ("quiet counsel," "steadfast edge") over concrete action, and several metaphors strain clarity ("the platform seemed to breathe").

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("thin breath of autumn," "whispered rumors turned into verses") but suffers from repetitive constructions and abstract loops. Multiple sentences restate the same concept of imperfect miracles and redemption without advancement, and filter-heavy passages ("she felt," "she sensed," "she remembered") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "resounding hush" appears four times without evolution; "journeying inward while walking out" repeats mechanically. Abstract diction dominates ("cosmic illusions," "spiral arbitration," "ultimate clarity") where concrete imagery would sharpen impact. The prose reaches for profundity through repetition rather than precision.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clean, rhythmically varied prose with strong information density, particularly in passages like "The gears clicked on razor edges of steel, their teeth meeting so precisely." Some philosophical passages ("the measurement of the horizon was not a line but a paradox") occasionally prioritize abstraction over concrete momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose shows competent rhythm and varied sentence structure but suffers from repetitive conceptual loops around "familiar strangers," "quiet wildfire," and "letting go." Some mixed metaphors ("wildfire calm" contradicts itself). The abstract register in places like "physics of letting go" creates distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("lucid contradictions," "theoretically rebellious") and telling phrases ("Mara's motivation was simple yet heavy") slow momentum. The paraphrase loop "to widen perspectives responsibly"/"her motivation to widen perspectives responsibly" and filter-heavy construction ("She felt the weight," "She knew," "She smiled") create distance from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions linking physical and emotional states. Some abstract phrasing creates mild opacity ("teaching endings how to begin" appears without concrete grounding), and occasional elevated diction ("melodically haunted design") slightly exceeds the established register, but momentum and clarity remain strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "haunted euphoria" (4x), "regenerated covenant" (5x), "gently thorough" (3x), creating loop patterns. Overwritten metaphors muddle clarity ("the paper itself were a tide"). Template cadence runs throughout with repetitive "He [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes atmospheric decoration over momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant overwriting issues: "swallowed by thick ivy," "captive star," "invisible ink," "emerald tangle" create figurative density without pattern-teaching (-0.6). Template cadence in "She gathered...They hacked...When the first shears" sequence (-0.5). Some effective rhythm variation but prose artifacts accumulate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the forest responded with a trail of musical notes, each tone rising and falling like a river of sound"), but suffers from occasional abstraction and template phrasing. Lines like "the map of her soul finally complete" and "horizon of her own becoming" lean toward generic spiritual language rather than specific imagery, and some metaphor vehicles strain coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.8)
    Extensive paraphrase loops plague the text: "strange comfort" appears three times, multiple restatements of editing/reweaving concept, and template cadence in "I felt... I turned... I whispered." Abstract phrasing like "contingent relationships" and "gravitational anomaly" repeats without gaining specificity, creating density without clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("silver sigh," "frozen memories," "mute grammar," "living stave") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She lifted...She pressed...She walked"). The prose prioritizes poetic effect over clarity, with abstract phrases like "creation thrives even in forgotten moments" replacing concrete resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.0)
    Significant repetition issues: "volcanic tenderness" appears four times, "analytically intuitive" twice, creating template cadence. The phrase "rescued a promise" and variations appear five times. Some sentences achieve lyric beauty ("dust danced like ash"), but paraphrase loops and abstract descriptors ("fierce love tempered by gentle heat") reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats with mixed metaphors ("aurora that draped the garden like a funeral veil, yet each filament glowed with the promise of renewal") and repetitive abstract phrasing about memory and sorrow. Template cadence appears in "Night after night...Each ripple sang...Each beat sending" structures, though some lyrical passages achieve genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and atmospheric with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages describing the storm's electromagnetic effects. Some overwriting appears ("creases like age-worn veins," "faint as a moth's wing") but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or plot, though some descriptive passages could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy overwriting with mixed metaphors (dental mirror against darkness, weaving with water shutters) that strain coherence. Template cadence pervades with repetitive "The guardian..." openings. Phrases like "spiralingly calm" and abstract constructions ("stillwater tension") obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing dulls momentum: "forests of second thoughts," "quiet revolution," "chorus of silent moves." Template constructions repeat throughout ("Mara watched...Mara believed...Mara began"). The prose prioritizes decorative metaphor over clear action, with key concepts like the magnetic grotto's function remaining opaque. Lines like "amplifying the quiet to a palpable hum" exemplify the preference for paradox over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong moments of propulsion ("The sea responded, pulling back the veil") but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("releasing the guarded hearts of all who had lived in fear" followed by similar spirit descriptions). Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence ("She felt... She knew... She stepped..."). Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others restate.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "remade hush" appears twice, "morally ambiguous" twice, "emotional void" twice, "lightness in grief" three times, "dried flowers/bouquet" six times. Template phrasing pervades: "She whispered to the dried flowers," "She whispered to the empty rooms." The abstract register ("morally ambiguous purpose," "quiet transformation") creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades: "cobalt atrium by the frozen lake glowed like a breath held in moonlight" typifies the density issue. Template repetition ("The poet feels," "He feels," "He walks") and paraphrase loops ("tremor of certainty" appears four times with minimal variation) significantly harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves strong imagery and rhythm but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language, creating exhaustion rather than emphasis. Template repetition appears in "bartered awakening" phrases (5+ instances) and some paraphrase loops ("imperfection was the truest melody" followed immediately by restating the same concept). The sustained lyricism works for the piece's mode but needs selective pruning for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("golden shadows" appears 5 times, "texture of connection" 4 times) and abstract constructions that blur specificity. Lines like "the notion of isolation dissolved, replaced by the warm golden shadows of mutual awareness" exemplify overwriting that dulls momentum. Template cadence appears in "The bell ringer..." constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.8)
    Extensive metaphorical density overwhelms clarity—"curtains of intention," "genuinely artificial," "filament of intention" create ornamental loops without advancing story. Template cadence appears in "She understood... She decided... She called... She followed..." structures. The abstract diction ("intention," "renewal," "transformation") replaces concrete action, creating momentum drag particularly in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy overwriting pervades the piece with mixed metaphors ("markets lay shattered like glass," "pulse slowed to a tentative rhythm"), repetitive mystical descriptors, and scaffold phrases. Lines like "She whispered to the void, confiding that the pattern she sought was not merely profit, but a blueprint of hope" exemplify the tell-heavy, abstract register that dulls momentum. Template cadence appears in "She knew... She realized... She imagined... She felt."

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting pervades the text with abstract figurative language in nearly every sentence ("vortex of forgotten childhoods," "slow tide," "erratic pilgrimage"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the pattern-breaking concept repeated in lines 8-10, 12-13, and 22-23. The density of metaphors obscures rather than clarifies key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.4)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("library's heart," "ribs of a great wing") and abstract emotional labels replacing concrete action. Template phrasing appears in "He understood that," "He knew that," "He sensed." The prose prioritizes atmospheric description over narrative momentum, with multiple sentences restating the same conceptual content about hope and shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure moments ("trembling comet," "hushed glow," "gentle tide") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in "She [verb], [modifier]" constructions. The paraphrase loop of balance/reconstruction concepts across multiple paragraphs dulls momentum, and abstract descriptors replace concrete action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though several instances of overwriting ("molten glass," "meteor hush radiance"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("wounds can hold hope" followed by similar restatements). The "meteor hush" repetition works as pattern but occasionally feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and imagery but suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without breathing room. Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("river of memory," "chambers she had always sensed," "telescope that surveyed the inner universe") and some paraphrase loops appear ("humming tune"/"melody" repeated across multiple beats).

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose and mixed metaphors ("stardust that clung to his skin," "verses that never reached sunrise"). Template repetition appears in "He learned," "He realized," "He recorded," "He sank," "He left." The prose privileges ornamental language over clarity and momentum, with nearly every sentence containing figurative language that obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments of compression and imagery but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("fractured lullaby" appears 6 times, "glowing dune in bloom" 4 times) and abstract terminology that obscures concrete action. Mixed metaphors ("chess clock...like a heart," "stitching destiny") and elevated diction sometimes clash with clarity, particularly in the wave function sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues undermine prose clarity: "hum of insight" appears 8 times, "probable miracles" 4 times, "wind through different trees" 5 times, creating template cadence. The verb "translocates" is grammatically awkward throughout. While individual sentences often achieve lyrical beauty, the accumulation of abstract phrases ("dormant engine lay coiled like a vine") and filter constructions weakens line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, but several instances of abstract telling ("feeling the weight of the ferry guides' trust") and some repetitive phrasing around "gently persistent" and "indirect routes." The line "courage, unused, lay dormant like a seed awaiting sunrise" restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph's parallel constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language ("walls shimmering like bruised sapphire," "silence that grew louder") that accumulates without purpose. Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same concepts—"unpardonable silence" appears four times, "frostbitten hope" three times, creating synonym churn rather than development. The prose prioritizes atmospheric density over clarity and momentum, with nearly every sentence attempting elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("iron gall ink pellet," "cracks spidered outward") but suffers from repetitive structures and occasional overwriting. Phrases like "hushed cathedral of stone and dust" and "pause of shifting constellations" lean purple. Multiple instances of template cadence appear ("He + verb" patterns), and some metaphors strain credibility (library as "cathedral," presence as "planetary").

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some evocative phrases. However, abstract formulations weaken key beats ("delayed revelation was not merely a cartographic curiosity"), and several passages restate concepts rather than advance them ("Future crews would be taught the same tapping method, a ritual that turned ordinary steel into a conduit"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract density ("thunderous serenity" appears 4 times) and metaphor pile-up that obscures concrete action. Template phrases like "she realized that," "she understood that" scaffold epiphanies. However, rhythm control in shorter sentences during the activation sequence ("She lifted the opera glasses once more") provides momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm but contains repetitive structures ("Anara [verb]" appears 8+ times). Phrases like "faint thrum echoing" and "frozen moment of destiny" lean purple. Information density is moderate; some passages could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line-level craft shows competence with varied sentence lengths and sensory specificity. However, several passages contain abstract metaphorical language that slows momentum ("the world seemed a map of loss and hope"), and phrases like "quietly talented gait" feel forced. The final third accumulates abstract declarations that weaken propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats with mixed metaphors (cards as "threads," "fragments," and "spiral" simultaneously) that muddle clarity. Template phrasing appears in "He realized that," "He wondered," "He lifted," creating mechanical transitions. The final paragraph contains three instances of telling what should be shown ("acknowledging the artist's descent").

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.4)
    Heavy overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("bruised light," "ghostly tide," "dying star"), abstract philosophizing, and template cadence in repetitive "Kael [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes ornamental description over momentum, with multiple paraphrase loops like "disappeared into the vapor of memory" followed by conceptually identical exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("shiver traveling down a frozen spine") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "dormant networks" (5 instances) and "echoing library under snow" (3 instances). Some mixed metaphors appear ("letter's ink...seemed to bleed" while also being "encrypted sigil"), and abstract declarations weaken concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "tranquil blaze" appears 6 times, "engraved quiet" 3 times, creating template cadence. Phrases like "senselessly perceptive" and "weaving continuity through chaos" repeat verbatim. The prose tends toward purple ("roses answered with a soft rustle, their thorns glinting like tiny swords sheathed in moonlight") without earning the elevation through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting dulls momentum: nearly every sentence contains figurative language without variation ("twilight of the sound wave garden," "sleepwalking constellations," "midnight flowers"). Template cadence appears in "He felt... He knew... He lifted... He reached..." structures, and abstract phrases like "transliterates emotions" recur without clarification.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("floating thought, solemn yet playful"). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical excess ("orbits of regret that anchored the city's most whispered conspiracies") but no major loops or scaffolding that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades: "thin seam between now and what-once-was," "mausoleum of forgotten frequencies," "trembling heart that dared listen." Nearly every sentence strains with figurative language that obscures rather than clarifies. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph with repetitive "she [verb]" constructions. Information density suffers from abstract philosophizing rather than concrete advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy figurative density clogs momentum ("lilac unease" appears 6 times; abstract phrases like "emergent hush" proliferate). Template constructions pervade: "She felt...," "Liora felt...," "He felt..." Register drift into philosophy-speak ("unlearning was not erasing knowledge but shedding the weight of assumptions") replaces concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("minaret mosaic tessera glimmered...like a wounded beacon") but suffers from abstract loops—"warm coldness" appears five times without deepening specificity. Several passages restate similar content ("mercy forged in steel" concept repeats across multiple paragraphs) and elevated diction occasionally obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.8)
    Persistent paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "echoes of his own lost performance, reverberations that would stitch together" restates the same concept. Template cadence appears in "The ghost felt...The ghost realized...He amplified...He began." Purple prose accumulates without precision ("luminous notes, each note a promise that possibility still lingered on the brink of despair"). The abstract language around "fractured timeline" and "aligning seconds" lacks concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dense figurative language appears throughout without clear pattern-teaching ("willowglass light," "telepathy pill recall," "somatic markers as conduit"), creating conceptual opacity. Template cadence runs appear ("She programmed...She recorded...She knew...") and the prose relies on abstract exposition over concrete action, particularly in describing the experimental process.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery: "droplets of vapor that rose like lanterns," "caves sang, a chorus of forgotten tides." Information density generally strong. Deductions for repetitive "factually mystical" and some abstract patches ("voice of the unknown" repeated without variation). The "elk leaf" typo near end breaks polish.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. However, several issues accumulate: repetitive use of "shared wisdom" (3x), "quietly inspired" (2x), and "unearthed silence" (2x) creates loops. Abstract phrases like "raw possibility" and "collective hope" lack concrete grounding. The phrase "as the truth unravels" appears twice verbatim. These artifacts don't touch closure directly but accumulate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy figurative density burdens most sentences ("crags breathing cold," "whisper of winter," "phoenix of light") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating ornamental rather than functional imagery. Template structures repeat ("He remembered," "He realized," "He understood"), and abstract phrases like "stitching together torn memories" obscure rather than clarify the actual transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose maintains atmospheric momentum but suffers from abstraction loops ("distill complexity into essence," "simple truth," "quiet answer"). Template cadence appears in "He [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphor of stitching/distilling/percolating weakens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "fractured timelines" concept is restated four times with minimal variation; "kindness" and the lantern's phototropic nature are explained redundantly. Template cadence appears in "She + verb" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The prose achieves moments of beauty but sacrifices propulsion to ornamental description, particularly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetition loops weaken momentum: "quivering hush" (5x), "rhythm of oars in water" (2x), "wistfully pragmatic" (2x), "protected vulnerability" (2x). Template cadence appears in "She felt...She whispered...She left...She paused." Overwriting in phrases like "silver ribbons dancing on the tide" and "argent ribbon" using archaic diction. Information density suffers from paraphrase loops: the vines' growth is described multiple ways without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pervasive repetition dulls momentum: "brittle awakenings" appears 7 times, "atomically reflective" 5 times, "brass sundial" 11 times without evolving meaning. Template structures dominate ("She [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]"). Mixed metaphors clash (library as kelp forest vs. breathing entity). The final third especially suffers from paraphrase loops—multiple sentences restate Mira's transformation without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with figurative language in most sentences ("notebook humming," "hush of centuries," "silken line pulling"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "She whispered...She stepped...She felt...She realized." Paraphrase loops occur: "keeper of secrets" restated as "role she could fulfill by guiding these letters."

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstract language ("ethereal pulse," "subsonic signatures," "cosmic pranksters") creates opacity without earning metaphorical coherence. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. The prose relies heavily on conceptual abstractions rather than concrete imagery, creating momentum drag particularly in the extended denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lines like "feeling the walls close like a familiar wound" and "architecture staging its own quiet rebellion" demonstrate strong figurative control, and the prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures. However, abstract phrases like "forgetting of stories that bind humanity" and "wistful rebellion against the limits he once knew" dilute specificity at crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("lance the void," "battlefield," "canvas as plain board"), abstract constructions ("dormant empathy," "unifying opposites"), and repetitive concept-loops about empathy awakening. Template phrases like "she felt," "she sensed," "she believed" create filter-verb stacks. The prose prioritizes atmospheric density over clarity, with key causality (how painting solves cases) remaining opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("spongey dread" appears four times with minimal variation; "reversible exile" repeats without clarification). Mixed metaphors create confusion (nail as "captured heartbeat" then "quiet beacon"). The prose achieves some strong moments ("syllable press against her spine like damp moss") but suffers from abstract inflation ("bridge the gap between memory and redemption") and repetitive sentence structures in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "luminous disbelief" appears 5 times, "pixelated amnesty" 7 times, "secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters" 4 times verbatim. Template cadence pervades ("He lifted," "He placed," "He understood"). Purple prose dominates without clear purpose ("cascade of amber light," "thread of sunrise").

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows with purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structure, particularly in descriptive passages of the circus train. However, several paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "polished calm"/"perceptively calm"/"same calm" repetition; "dusky" appears four times with similar function. The phrase "markers would stifle creative routes" followed immediately by explanation of the same concept weakens density.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with abstract metaphors ("veil of restless night," "humming with residue") and repetitive mystical descriptors. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around "shared burdens" restated without advancement. Template cadence emerges in "She felt... She realized... She whispered..." constructions. The prose prioritizes atmospheric effect over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetition problems: "warlike serenity" appears four times, "swirling orchard vortex" three times, and multiple paraphrase loops ("She knows that mirrors never show what lies beneath the surface, only what reflects, and she seeks what mirrors don't show"). Template cadence dominates with "She [verb]" constructions. The prose relies on mystical abstractions rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy reliance on abstract mystical language ("filament of color weaving a tapestry of collective desire," "luminous threads of hope") creates opacity without earning resonance. Template constructions appear throughout ("She understood that," "She felt," "She reached"). The prose prioritizes elevated diction over clarity, with multiple paraphrase loops around the covenant's purpose diluting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing atmosphere and action simultaneously, as in "She knelt beside a gnarled root that coiled around a crown of vertebrae." However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("turning voids into conduits of memory" followed by "As the conduit filled"), and overwrought metaphors like "trammel against despair" create opacity. The prose would benefit from pruning ornamental language that doesn't advance the ritual's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract constructions ("buzzing doubt," "vague yearning," "quiet conviction") and overreliance on telling phrases. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the applause/echo concept being restated without added pressure. The metaphor density in high-pressure moments ("cymbal of possibility, reverberating through the valley") obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("wind whisper ancient codes") but suffers from abstract scaffolding. Phrases like "profound yet simple," "living laboratory," and "gentle reestablishment of balance" provide summary rather than scene. The paraphrase loop around "haunted ambitions" (appearing five times with minimal variation) dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Several abstract phrases weaken clarity ("accepting contradictions" appears multiple times without concrete embodiment). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("wintersun serenity," "migrating identities") but doesn't obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "resonant hush of the crystal caves wrapped the world in a soft, trembling gleam" could achieve the same effect with half the words. Template cadence appears in the confession sequence ("With each confession absorbed...Mara lifted...She whispered..."). Abstract descriptors ("ancient lullabies," "quiet reverence") replace specific detail. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over momentum, creating drag especially in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("The air smelled of rust and rain") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "daringly methodical" (appears 5 times) and some abstract scaffolding ("raw solace" appears twice). The accordion bellows being both carried and part of the coat creates minor confusion. Information density is generally strong with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("cautious exuberance" appears 4 times, "cyclically reversed" 3 times, "propagation delays" 3 times). Sentences favor telling over embodied action ("I noted," "We realized," "We vowed"). Information density is moderate—many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("velvet observatory at midsummer hummed with quiet reverence") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently. Phrases like "perforated destiny" and "lattice of veins" accumulate without always advancing the story, creating ornamental weight.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence lengths creating visual rhythm. Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere, action, and theme simultaneously. Deduction for occasional abstraction ("tapestry of existence," "honor every fleeting glow") and slight repetition of "radiant hush" and threshold concepts that edge toward loop territory without quite crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("kindly decisive" appears verbatim three times, "umbral grotto above the clouds" four times). Some metaphors strain ("heart scalloping with a rhythm"). However, rhythm varies appropriately and several images land effectively ("leaves rustling like distant applause"). Template patterns emerge in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with figurative language in most sentences ("conscience for hire satisfied," "spiraled steps...like a heartbeat"), creating density without purpose. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the doubt/certainty theme restated across adjacent sentences. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("the platform's gentle sway induced") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Some redundancy appears ("weaves truth carefully"/"weaving truth carefully") and filter constructions ("felt the paradox") dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with purposeful repetition of "pulse" and "echo" that serves the accumulative structure. Some phrases edge toward overwriting ("skeletal spires rose like ancient ribs") but information density remains high. The "weathered resolve" repetition works as pattern-teaching rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetition issues pervade: "lingering luminance" appears 7 times, "accommodate impossibilities" 4 times, "brilliant dimness" 3 times, creating template cadence. Abstract phrasing like "quiet brilliance" and "sacred in the simple" substitutes for concrete imagery. The prose relies on telling over showing ("his journey complete, yet his heart remained a garden folly") and contains multiple paraphrase loops restating the same concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and sensory detail, but suffers from overwriting in places: "quiet river of stars," "meteor hush" (used 3 times), and abstract formulations like "luminous vow." Some figurative density without clear payoff ("sleeping leviathan"), though no major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or concept. However, the extended final section (last 8 sentences) contains paraphrase loops around alignment/purpose and some template phrasing ("felt like," "seemed to"). Figurative language occasionally strains ("rusted dome of forgotten suns").

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("dust motes into tiny prisms") but suffers from abstract constructions like "heartbroken reaper" and "distant intimacy" that tell rather than embody. Some passages loop conceptually ("echo of sacrifice" appears four times with minimal variation). The line "transformation from burden into bridge" exemplifies the tendency toward abstract summary rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("He [verb]" patterns), abstract descriptors ("cosmic imbalance," "subtle tilt"), and redundant restatements of the bell's healing. The phrase "earnest naive heart" appears verbatim twice, and several sentences paraphrase rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from overwrought figurative language ("silver ribbon over the restless water," "edges a whisper of old pine") and abstract phrasing that dulls momentum. The opening's temporal impossibility ("midnight ridgeway at twilight") creates immediate confusion. Multiple synonym loops appear ("mirrored hush"/"mirrored glass," "quiet observation"/"quiet offering"/"quiet vigilance") and the elevated register often clashes with the investigative action.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without always advancing pressure ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "sapphire fire," "algorithmic dance"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("the harmony she sought was now within reach" followed by "logic and intuition were beginning to sing together"). Template cadence appears in the final third with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive "soundless echo" iterations (4 times) and template constructions ("He was...," "He reached...," "He felt..."). Mixed metaphors appear ("cathedral of leaves" that "swayed"). However, sentences vary in length and the atmospheric language creates intended mood despite overwriting in places.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing dulls momentum: "complementary opposites," "paradoxical truth," "vivify dead parts" repeat without concrete grounding. Template cadence runs throughout ("Kael stood," "Kael felt," "Kael stepped back," "Kael's story") create mechanical rhythm. The phrase "slicing through pretense" appears four times, becoming a meaningless refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with mixed metaphors ("riddles like chess pieces," "whisper that rose from the mailbox," "river feeding the roots") and elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies. Template phrases like "storm-born silence" repeat three times. The final paragraph contains multiple abstract assertions that summarize theme rather than dramatize closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence creates overwriting ("blade of sound began to macerate the heavy silence, grinding it into fine particles that floated like ash"). Template cadence appears in repeated "The [subject]" openings across multiple paragraphs. Some mixed metaphors strain coherence (leaf blower as baton/blade/surgeon's tool).

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("every petal stored a story, and every breath of wind whispered a chapter") but suffers from abstract density that obscures meaning. "Interiorizing exteriors" appears three times without clear dramatization of what this means physically. Several sentences require multiple readings for basic comprehension, and the metaphorical layering occasionally contradicts itself (frozen/warm, solid/mist).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    While generally clean, the prose suffers from ornamental density in places ("trembling hue that mirrors the frozen bloom of twilight") and some template phrasing ("He began by...," "He mixed...," "He brushed..."). The repetitive "He [verb]" structure through the middle section creates a mechanical cadence that undermines momentum, though the final image lands with appropriate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant paraphrase loops damage momentum ("serenely electric" appears 5 times, "beginning in every ending" conceptually repeated). Template cadence runs through "She [verb]" constructions, and abstract phrasing like "practical magic" and "disciplined mind could coax wonder" creates register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and imagery but suffers from repetitive structures ("Lio stepped," "Lio guided," "Lio felt") and some overwrought figurative language ("minutes curled back on themselves like ribbons"). The phrase "spectral grotto under starlight" appears verbatim three times, creating unnecessary loops despite its thematic importance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from abstraction loops ("texture of connection" appears twice unchanged) and overreliance on conceptual descriptors. Phrases like "realistically imaginary" and "rational enchantment" repeat without evolution, and several passages paraphrase the same idea about connections being both material and imagined, reducing momentum despite some vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and clear spatial choreography. Some passages accumulate description without advancing pressure ("Night after night, the benthic city's corridors thrummed..."). The text contains minimal loops but several beats restate similar content about horizons and navigation without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates rhythmic variety and atmospheric density but suffers from overwriting in places ("reeling hush," "fog of oblivion"). Some metaphors strain credibility ("contact tracer for hearts"). Information density is moderate; several passages could be compressed without loss. The piece avoids major loops but indulges in ornamental language that occasionally obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.2)
    Strong moments of figurative language ("hulking mouth that swallowed any hint of daylight") but density becomes excessive with mixed metaphors. Template cadence appears in "She raised...She stepped...She buried" sequence, and the phrase "crashing hush" creates logical contradiction without taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Overwrought figurative language creates density issues—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated diction ("frozen lantern," "legal phantom," "ephemeral patterns," "crystalline whispers"). Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence ("She realized... She stepped... She smiled..."). The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but sacrifices momentum to ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.9)
    While individual sentences often achieve lyric beauty, the prose suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without sufficient breathing room. Mixed metaphors appear ("wings flashing like punctuation marks" immediately becomes "looping arcs"). The piece also contains repetitive constructions ("He whispered," "He began," "He knew," "He lifted") that create template cadence in key passages.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, but suffers from abstract modifier chains ("gravitationally playful pull," "static-laden confessions") and some paraphrase loops ("the garden's underground murmurs followed, a chorus of leaves that sang"). The modifier "gravitationally playful" appears four times, creating repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple instances of paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "signal through heart rhythms"/"heart-driven music"/"heart rhythms that matched." The prose suffers from overwriting in places ("resonantly soft" appears four times) and abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. Template cadence appears in "He lifted...He felt...He left" construction. Information density is moderate but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows purposeful rhythm variation and some strong images ("thunderstorm in a bottle," "metallic bird"). However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("fragile peace," "linking absences," "invisible line") and some sentences rely on telling over showing ("Milo's mission was not to deliver letters but to foster..."). Template structure appears in parallel constructions that could vary more.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant overwriting issues with mixed metaphors ("halo fragment" as both "moonlight preserved in amber glass" and source of "whispering gleam") and repetitive phrasing weaken precision. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions. The prose reaches for poetry but often lands in purple territory, particularly in phrases like "chorus of rusted prayers."

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with mixed metaphors ("electronic sighs," "breathing verses") and purple prose ("ghostly fireflies in the dim light"). Template cadence appears in repetitive "Mara [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity, with vague abstractions like "analog memories" never gaining concrete meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive overwriting with stacked modifiers ("weather-worn watercolor palette, its pigments faded like old letters"), abstract constructions that obscure meaning, and template repetition of "luminous absence" and "cipher of longing." The phrase "vitalize/vitalizing" appears 5 times creating mechanical repetition. Mixed metaphors (light as both physical substance caught in nets and abstract bridge) muddle the central conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.4)
    Overwriting pervades: "enigmatic locksmith," "unassumingly bold," "whispering void," "enveloped secrets" stack modifiers without advancing story. Template cadence appears in repetitive structures ("He realized...," "He understood...," "He stepped..."). The prose prioritizes atmospheric accumulation over clarity and momentum, with abstract phrases like "hush of cosmic possibility" obscuring rather than illuminating.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in places—"ghostly greenhouse," "jagged circle," "ancient singers" pile up without earning their weight. Several passages loop conceptually, particularly around the fairy ring's function being explained multiple times. However, stronger moments like "the air tasted of sugar and salt, a crisp nostalgia" show control, and the piece maintains forward momentum despite ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("afternoon shadow caught in glass, a thin rectangle of darkness") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff. Template cadence appears in "She whispered... She felt... She placed..." sequences. Information density varies wildly between ornate description and plot advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("liquid amber" sunrise, seeds drinking "misty sighs"), repetitive phrases ("radiant hush" appears four times), and purple prose that obscures momentum. Template phrasing like "insatiably creative" and abstract constructions ("capturing essence of each sunrise") create distance rather than immediacy. The prose prioritizes ornamental description over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "interlaced hush" appears 6 times, "tapestry needle" concepts repeat without variation, and the hush/silence/quiet cluster creates synonym churn. Sentences beginning "The [noun]" dominate, creating template cadence. The prose achieves atmospheric density but at the cost of clarity and propulsion, with abstract phrasing ("lucid unrest") that resists concrete meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bruised purple sky"), some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("shielded openness"), and the final paragraph's drift into conceptual summary rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("breath a silent bubble in the stale water") but suffers from overwriting. Figurative density overwhelms in places: "each flake a moment slipping away" followed immediately by more metaphor. Template cadence appears in "He thought... He realized... He rose..." sequence. Some abstract philosophizing dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("The courtyard's mist swirled, catching the ghost's luminous sighs and scattering them like seed across clouds") but suffers from repetitive constructions and occasional overwriting. Template phrases like "The balladeer understood" and "The balladeer watched" create mechanical transitions. Several metaphors strain clarity ("ghost in code sheathed in vapor"), and abstract language sometimes replaces concrete imagery where specificity would strengthen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades with density issues: "frost-kissed stone," "warmly inquisitive spark," "reverent care," "prismatic shards." Abstract emotional labeling ("gentle, pervasive contentment," "calm sea of affection") replaces concrete sensation. Template phrases like "seemed to" appear repeatedly, creating distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern or payoff. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: the gondola is simultaneously "moth's wing," "shrine," and "cradle." Template repetition appears in "She [verb]" constructions. The closing image of strings "humming a lullaby of spooled wholeness that only the dust-lit stars could hear" strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure moments: "fractally precise" appears twice, metaphors stack densely ("breathe with the weight of unread centuries"), and elevated diction occasionally obscures clarity. Template patterns emerge: "She felt...," "She knew...," "She stepped back, feeling..." The prose reaches for poetry but sacrifices momentum through ornamental density.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose density suffers from ornamental figurative language ("sea of clouds," "living constellations," "choir of distant birds") and repetitive phrasing around the luminance concept. The piece maintains momentum but several sentences restate information without adding pressure, particularly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, but figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure ("soft hush of a distant morning," "memory of forgotten ages," "frozen rain"). Some paraphrase loops: "rhythm of repair"/"pulse that steadied broken time" restate similar concepts. Information density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or action. Minor issues include abstract phrases ("brambled hope," "tangled optimism") and slight repetition of "nebula of respite" without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty - "the lighthouse rose like a scarred thumb" - with good syntactic variety and rhythm. However, "bruised awe" appears three times (including the required tone element), "nested patterns" twice, and "vouchsafe/vouchsafing" twice, creating mild repetitive drag. The abstract phrases "time's final ripple" and "whispered to her in childhood by a dying sailor" lack the concrete specificity that anchors the best passages.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing atmosphere or ritual progression. Template cadence appears in "I watch...I watch...I turn away" pattern and abstract descriptors ("graceless beauty," "jagged elegance") recur without added precision. Minor paraphrase loop with "graceless beauty/graceless ballet" repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several template phrases weaken momentum: "She felt a loosened grief rise," "Mara finally felt the pieces fall into place." The metaphor "empty chrysalis" repeats 4 times without evolution until late transformation. Some filter-verb clustering ("She imagined," "She remembered," "She felt") dulls immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching ("glass orchard," "swirling sea of clouds," "shelves of translucent bark"). Several abstract phrases obscure meaning ("quantifying the absence of narrative weight"). The paraphrase loop of "glimmering parole" appearing four times without evolution costs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong figurative language generally serves the story's logic ("sandpaper rough memories," walls that "rippled with a soft glow"), though density occasionally overwhelms in descriptive passages. Some redundancy in describing the remorse's contagious nature across multiple sentences. The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks, with particularly effective rhythm in the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("a soft sunrise captured in amber"), it suffers from redundancy ("empathetically decisive" appears twice, "vigorous tender/tender vigor" reversal) and occasional overwriting. The density of figurative language in nearly every sentence, while pattern-consistent, occasionally obscures momentum without clear payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure moments: "The canyon responded, a low hum rising from deep within, as if the rocks themselves were recalling a long-lost song" layers metaphor without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in "She realized... She noted... She steadied herself." The phrase "quaking reverie" repeats verbatim, suggesting limited vocabulary for the emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.9)
    While individual sentences achieve lyric beauty, repetitive structures proliferate: "She [verb]" opens too many consecutive sentences, and "latent blaze" appears four times without evolution. The prose lacks momentum in places, particularly the extended grotto sequence where description overwhelms forward movement, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "empathy in motion" (5x), "symphonically minded" (3x), "after the hedgehog uncurls" (3x), "intensely quiet" (3x), "porcelain insulator" (6x without variation). Template cadence runs appear in multiple paragraphs starting with "He" or "The." Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle (porcelain both "canvas" and "bridge"). These artifacts don't obscure closure but significantly impact flow.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe overwriting pervades with purple prose ("wan flag against the wind," "hopeful melancholy swell within his chest"), repetitive stems, and abstract philosophy replacing concrete action. Template cadence runs throughout ("He whispered," "He lifted," "He placed," "He turned," "He recalled") and the final third loops the same concepts without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    While individual sentences demonstrate craft ("Every tool hung like a note on a staff"), the prose suffers from density overload with figurative language in nearly every sentence without clear pattern or payoff. Mixed metaphors appear ("midnight roses" for ink, vibrations as "ripples of copper"), and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("cataloged silences"/"varieties of silence").

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive repetition weakens momentum: "undercurrent of wisdom" appears 6 times, "wildflower hush" 4 times, "olfactorily sensitive" 3 times, "serenity...within motion" 4 times. Template phrasing ("She would journalize," "Lira journalized") and abstract descriptors ("ancient riddles," "deep truth") replace concrete action. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity and forward drive.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dense, sometimes overwritten prose with figurative language in most sentences ("silver veins," "quiet balloons," "kelp-like roots"). Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions. The writing prioritizes atmospheric description over propulsive clarity, creating momentum drag in places. Some mixed metaphors (roots as kelp, silence as vortex) muddy the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("ghostly vortex," "hopeful fingers") without pattern-teaching. Template phrasing emerges in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, though information density remains adequate.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition loops pervade: "sculpted hush" appears 4 times, "through the colors of the aurora" 5 times, "oscillating repose" 3 times, creating template cadence. Abstract elevated diction ("unfettered," "certify wonder as essential") replaces concrete action throughout. The prose achieves atmosphere but at the cost of clarity and momentum—nearly every sentence could be cut without losing plot information.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("canyon hush" appears 5 times, "gilded reed flute" 6 times) and abstract language that dulls immediacy ("weaving of worlds," "texture of possibility"). Template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The line "avalanchingly quiet" strains metaphor coherence - avalanches are sudden and loud, creating a contradictory vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("Between vanishing stars, a thin veil of night thinned like parchment") with strong information density. However, several template patterns emerge: "she believed" appears twice in close succession, "each [noun]" constructions repeat, and phrases like "lucid turbulence" recur without evolution. The figurative density occasionally obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("dragonfly-wing pendant that shimmered like a captured sunrise") but suffers from repetitive stems and overuse of "germinate." Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("He believed...," "He remembered...," "He felt..."). Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others loop concepts like "brief encounters" without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.1)
    Heavy reliance on abstract mystical language ("shifted hush," "truthful lie," "commune through thought") creates opacity without earning complexity. The phrase "shifted hush" appears four times unchanged. Template constructions like "She believed that...," "She knew...," "She vowed..." create mechanical rhythm. The prose accomplishes basic clarity but lacks propulsive momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting issues include the triple repetition of "stoically sparkling" and dense figurative language that occasionally obscures clarity ("hush of time's unraveling tapestry"). Several paraphrase loops: "raveling silence" concepts reiterated without advancement. However, the prose maintains momentum and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "quietly determined" appears twice, "bartered awakenings" four times, "coax resilience from rubble" three times. Template cadence emerges in "He [verb]" constructions. The prose achieves moments of clarity ("blade sang when lifted") but synonym churn and abstract descriptors ("azure defiance") dilute precision.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from density issues - figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff pattern. Phrases like "murmur of half-remembered dreams" and "pearls in a glass bottle" accumulate without advancing pressure, creating mild overwriting that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant overwriting issues throughout: "luminescent ache" appears twice, mixed metaphors proliferate ("bottle the feeling," "lighthouse for hearts"), and abstract phrasing dominates ("collective memory of those who dared to care"). Template cadence emerges in the stone-stacking sequence ("He pressed...and etched," "The third stone held"). The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity, creating opacity around key actions.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("living serpent of light") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff, creating opacity. Template patterns emerge ("Mira felt...She whispered...She stepped forward") and abstract assertions ("strange, joyous melancholy") replace embodied specificity in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive template cadence ("She believed...She sensed...She smiled...She stepped") and filter-verb stacks ("feeling the valley mist swirl," "feeling the cool edge") dull immediacy. Abstract phrases like "quietly explosive insight" and "stories forever magnetized" lack concrete grounding, creating conceptual loops rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant issues with overwriting and repetition damage momentum. Multiple instances of paraphrase loops: "quantified sorrow"/"quantified grief," "healed in moonlight"/"healing in moonlight," "mundane miracle"/"mundane miracles." Template cadence appears in "He + verb" constructions repeated across paragraphs. The prose reaches for lyricism but often lands in purple territory ("silver light poured through the cracked shutters, bathing the sextant and the cracked walls in a soft glow").

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("breathing cathedral," "loom of woven dawns," "cascade outward like ribbons of light"), creating opacity without pattern-teaching or payoff. Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same content: "knit communities together"/"binding strangers into families," "swaddle the world in music"/"wrapping its shadows in soft, warm cadence." Template cadence runs throughout with repetitive "The [noun], [appositive], [verb]" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstraction and metaphorical density obscure clarity: "his spirit lingered beyond the threshold," "dimension stitched between shadows and sunlight," "rows of ancient tomes that breathed softly." Template mystical phrases ("whispered a promise to the night," "centuries as the doorway opened") and repetitive "settled like" constructions drain momentum, while the paraphrase loop of paradox explanations adds no new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repeated abstract phrases ("tenuous absolution" 3x, "heuristically gentle" 2x, "uncloak" 3x) that become loops rather than purposeful pattern. Overwriting appears in mixed metaphors ("bloom of a weed as a confession") and elevated register inappropriate for scene pressure. Template cadence emerges in "He [verb]" constructions, though some lyrical passages achieve genuine rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures create momentum. However, abstract phrases accumulate ("edge of oblivion," "abyss of silence," "corridor of meaning") without concrete anchoring. Some redundancy appears ("quartz hush" used four times, multiple variations of measuring/recording). The prose achieves moments of crystalline precision but lapses into conceptual vagueness that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several passages contain unnecessary abstraction and repetition: "Her motivation was to capture the sound of trust breaking" tells what could be shown; "the comforting unease" appears four times without evolution. Strong moments like "The barrel burst with aromatic vapor" demonstrate clarity, but phrases like "choreographed through countless false starts she had survived" and "the seed of future conflict" lean abstract. The template-like structure of some sentences ("She knew... She had rehearsed... She paused...") creates monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("emergent compass...learning the lay of paths"/"emergent compass...map the invisible currents"), abstract concept-stacking, and therapy-speak realizations ("felt a strange kinship"). The line "people whose cloaks seemed to storm and clear with each heartbeat" exemplifies the overreliance on figurative language without grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("each fragment humming the unsolved riddles") but suffers from repetitive "auroral sorrow" (4x) and occasional overwriting ("the world's muted creativity flood her veins like fresh blood"). Some abstract constructions ("inescapable calling toward the device") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments of imagery ("glass towers breathing misty sighs") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She believed," "She felt," "She decided," "She realized"). Several passages restate concepts without added pressure ("candor in small moments could restore whole worlds" echoes the earlier similar statement). The writing maintains clarity but could achieve greater concision—multiple sentences do single jobs rather than layering information.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "glisten" appears 10 times, "symphonies of truth" 4 times, "color of wonder" 4 times, creating synonym churn rather than purposeful pattern. Multiple paraphrase loops ("The wind...now arrives with a tempered vigor" followed by immediate restatement). Template cadence in "He knows...," "He walks...," "He does not need..." sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.2)
    Strong moments like "titanium skin glinting like sunrise on sand" show careful craft, but the prose suffers from abstract loops ("fragmented wholeness," "quiet legend"), ornamental metaphors ("stars scattering across the sky like fractured glass"), and summary-heavy passages. The phrase "miniaturized chaos" repeats without variation, and several sentences restate rather than advance ("The farm's systems recorded the event as a success, its logs noting...").

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition issues: "sandstorm calm" appears 6 times, "when the outside world intrudes" twice verbatim, "aged locket led through following" multiple times. Template cadence pervades: "She [verb], [result]" structure dominates. The awkward construction "led through following" and other phrasing suggests algorithmic generation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several passages contain paraphrase loops ("turning weakness into a pattern of strength the world could not read" followed immediately by similar restatement) and abstract declarations that slow momentum. The phrase "calm defiance" appears four times without variation, creating repetitive phrasing. However, strong moments like "the ink a luminous algae that faded only when read" show precise, evocative detail, and the closing image of dice as "silent witnesses" lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.7)
    Overwriting issues pervade high-pressure beats with figurative language in most sentences ("salt crystal growing chamber," "tide's breath hardened," "gravity pockets pulse like a heartbeat"). Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions, and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("The flame grew brighter...turning the darkness into a gleaming silence" followed immediately by "In that quiet blaze").

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("incandescent glow," "luminous arcs," "tranquil blaze" in close proximity). Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, ritual progress, or stakes. Minor redundancy in describing the hush's spreading effect reduces momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose maintains atmospheric density with vivid imagery—"meteor shower painted silver streaks," "garden pulse with an ancient rhythm"—but suffers from repetitive phrasing around stone/building language that creates mild loops. Several sentences could be cut without loss ("The meteor shower intensified, each streak a fleeting hymn" adds atmosphere but not pressure). Information density is moderate; most sentences do single rather than multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "resonance structures" appears 8 times, "ghostly resolve" 5 times, "tragically radiant" 4 times, creating template-cadence runs. The phrase "quarantined memory" and variations cycle throughout without adding pressure. These artifacts touch the closure beat, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from abstract elevation ("quietly shining resolve," "wisely enduring calm") and repetitive structures. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "forgive the unfinished" concepts reiterated without advancement. Template cadence pervades ("She traced," "She wielded," "She whispered"). Information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery, though some phrases edge toward purple ("wistful sigh," "trembling chord"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing atmosphere or revelation. Minor redundancy in emotional descriptors ("melancholy" appears multiple times) and occasional abstraction ("webs of intrigue") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("candles flickered, each flame catching a sliver of borrowed starlight"). However, abstract scaffolding pervades ("The method was simple yet profound," "She realized that"). Template cadence appears in dream cataloging. The final paragraph's declarative assertions ("she knew the pure thing she salvaged would illuminate") replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language appearing in most sentences ("whispering parapet," "loom of thoughts," "hesitant punctuation marks"). Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content: "hidden patterns" appears seven times with minimal variation in meaning. Template cadence emerges in repetitive "He [verb]" constructions, and abstract philosophizing ("true scaffolding of existence") replaces concrete imagery at crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose maintains basic clarity but suffers from repetitive structures ("Mira felt...", "She had come to...", "She suspected...") and abstract phrasing that tells rather than shows ("the exhilaration of having turned myth into measurable reality"). Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant template cadence issues with "He [verb]" constructions and paraphrase loops, particularly "variant allegiance" appearing 7 times and "ancient shadows" 5 times without meaningful variation. The prose achieves moments of vivid imagery but suffers from abstract philosophizing and redundant conceptual restatements. Filter-verb stacks ("He believed," "He listened," "He recalled") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory specificity. However, several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("positively wistful" appears twice, "lonesome splendor" twice) and some metaphors stretch ("dust motes...like tiny planets in a far-away sky"). The repetition of "sweeten" feels mechanical rather than pattern-taught. These artifacts don't obscure closure but prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with phrases like "fleshly ethereal glow" and "azure-coat lighthouse engineer" that prioritize ornamentation over clarity. Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("logically emotional mind"/"logically emotional brain," repeated "sonic absolution"), and the abstract register ("promise of sonic absolution," "vibrational matching") creates distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.4)
    Extensive overwriting pervades: "restrained wildness" appears 4 times, "softly purposeful" 3 times, creating template cadence. Mixed metaphors ("calm fire," "tide of distant sea," "silver veins") lack coherence. Paraphrase loops abound: "patient revolution"/"slow uprising of patience" restate without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.7)
    Significant prose issues include repetitive phrasing ("reverberate" appears 4 times, "controlling influence" 3 times, "fortified vulnerability" twice), abstract elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies ("fortified vulnerability," "entangled memories"), and paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate without advancement. The template cadence of "I [verb]" constructions and filter-heavy observation ("I felt," "I recalled," "I noted") dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant issues with repetitive phrasing ("vibrant hush" appears twice, "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" appears twice verbatim). Template cadence runs through multiple "He [verb]" constructions. The prose achieves moments of grace but suffers from overwriting in places ("whispered confessions," "weight of iron bars") and some purple patches that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and inventive imagery ("fleeting constellations," "handshake of the universe"), though some metaphors strain ("yearning algorithm" appears without clear mechanical function). Template repetition emerges in "She [verb]" constructions in the final paragraph. Information density is moderate—descriptive passages don't always advance story or deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful technical vocabulary, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("The code matched the three numbers she had seen, confirming that the crew had hidden their coordinates"). Mixed metaphor of "phantom breadcrumbs" slightly muddles the digital/physical boundary. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely restate.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from overwriting ("shadow-laced," "frost-kissed," "weather-worn") and abstract mystical language that obscures concrete action. Template structures appear: "She watched...She felt...She understood..." creates repetitive cadence. The final paragraph contains multiple theme statements that should emerge through image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("sunrise over the drift-ice marina painted the cracked wooden piers") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts. "Fold in patience" appears 7 times, "sound of endings" 4 times, "windborne solace" 3 times - this repetition serves the accumulative structure but creates some density drag. Several abstract constructions ("the elusive cadence that marked a life's final paragraph") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "gently persuasive" appears 4 times, "drawing parallels" 4 times, "passionate subtlety" 4 times, "mismatched" 5 times, creating mechanical template patterns. Abstract phrasing ("intersubjective understanding," "harmonious harvest") replaces concrete imagery. The prose loops through variations of the same concepts without advancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.6)
    The line-level craft shows competent control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages like "soft sea of grain shimmering under a pale sun." Some metaphors work well (the pavilion's murmuring, sand as sea), but abstract phrases like "imprint remained in the hearts" and "fragile fire" lean generic. The piece avoids major artifacts but could achieve greater specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant overwriting issues: "swirled like whispered secrets," "pulse with the collective heartbeat," "tears fell like dew" (-0.8 for density). Template cadence appears in "She whispered...She knew...She cataloged" structure (-0.5). Multiple paraphrase loops, particularly around collective healing concept.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("suspended hush," "sonically reflective"), repetitive phrasing ("weathered innocence" appears 4 times), and template structures. The phrase "sonically reflective" is physically nonsensical - sound doesn't reflect visually. Paraphrase loops abound: "pattern of growth" concepts repeat without advancement. Filter-verb stacks and abstract language dull immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic variety and information density, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or meaning. Some metaphor clustering in peak moments ("tide of longing," "shells onto the shore of his mind") creates slight opacity, and phrases like "resonated like the distant hiss" could be more direct.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.3)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "luminous ache" appears 6 times, "changelessly constant" 3 times, extensive paraphrase loops ("the observatory could now measure the very threshold where dreams escaped gravity" restates earlier concepts). Template cadence runs throughout ("He knew...," "He felt...," "He stepped...") create mechanical rhythm. Mixed metaphors strain coherence (clock hand as "filament of starlight" while being mechanical).

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("duty settle like dew," "rooms pulse with stillness"), abstract descriptors ("decisively kind," "pulsing stillness"), and impossible physics (vinyl producing "scent of hope"). Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes ornamental language over clarity, with figurative density in most sentences without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive structures ("She whispered... She realized... She pressed... She stepped...") and occasional purple patches. Information density is uneven, with some sentences doing multiple jobs while others merely restate ("The key's purpose, then, was to bridge the loop between observation and revelation").

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language ("secret cradle," "luminous pattern," "literal cleft") without pattern or payoff. Mixed metaphors ("vertebrae of truth," "mistakes into constellations") and abstract phrasing ("nostalgic innovation") obscure rather than illuminate key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing - "reflectively vibrant" appears three times, "zephyr bloom" four times. Figurative density overwhelms in places ("pearl of stillness pulsed," "spiral of glass," "luminous chords") without clear payoff. Several abstract constructions weaken immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "honeyed hush" appears six times, "protected vulnerability" three times, and "proffer/proffered/proffering" four times without pattern-teaching or payoff. The prose favors abstract emotional labels over concrete action, with passages like "protected vulnerability rise within her" that tell rather than embody states, creating template cadence that dulls urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff ("air pulse like a held breath," "whisper of closing pages," "trembles like a heartbeat"). Template repetition emerges in "She + verb" constructions across multiple paragraphs, and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("conflicted yet resolute" restates established tension).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery ("golden threads of light spiraled outward"). However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "forgotten songs" appears five times; "gathering hush" three times. The phrase "listened with reverence" repeats exactly, and some constructions feel templated ("From that day forward").

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe template cadence runs throughout: "She whispered...She felt...She stepped back...She pressed...She knew...She promised...She closed...She smiled." Paraphrase loops abound: "moving stillness" appears four times with minimal variation. Abstract padding ("quiet triumph," "patient reverence") replaces concrete imagery. Information density is low with repetitive conceptual assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing around reflection/echo concepts and overuse of abstract descriptors ("wounded season," "cellar of reason"). The final paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops restating the same content. Template cadence appears in "He realized... He recorded... He felt..." constructions. However, individual sentences flow smoothly and grammar remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.6)
    Repetitive phrase structures ("She + verb" patterns) and abstract descriptors ("boundary-lessly trapped," "whalebone reverie") recur without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. The prose achieves atmosphere but sacrifices clarity and momentum, particularly in passages like "orienting properly meant aligning the lamp's glass to the moon's edge" which could be more concise.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("rain-beaded skylight," "steam traced silver veins") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats with mixed metaphors and abstract philosophizing. Template cadence appears in multiple runs of "She [verb]" structures. Paraphrase loops occur ("grief is both here and gone"/"the paradox of here and gone could be lived"), and some figurative language strains credibility (the kettle's steam as "silver veins marking time").

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves strong imagery and rhythm variation, but suffers from occasional abstract phrasing ("eroded ambitions," "fractured stillness") and some repetitive constructions around the ghost negotiation. The opening and closing images connect effectively, though middle sections contain some scaffold phrases ("she noted the fragment, storing it with a sigh").

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive repetition weakens momentum: "maze of intentions" appears four times, "stoic wonder" three times, "redirected flows" variants throughout. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]" opens most sentences), and abstract phrasing like "functionally creative" and "ethical currents" obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition issues undermine prose quality: "excruciatingly gentle" (5x), "petrichor nostalgia" (3x), "glacial hush" (3x), duplicate sentence about imagining the memory-counting clock. These loops, combined with abstract descriptors and mixed metaphors (crystal "exhaled" a "soundless echo"), create significant momentum drag. The filter-verb stack and paraphrase loops in the closure paragraph trigger the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.8)
    Extensive paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "architecture of lies unravel"/"architecture of lies crumble"/"salvage truth"/"salvage the stories" repeat without advancement. Template cadence ("He felt...He realized...He whispered...He raised") creates mechanical rhythm. Mixed metaphors (sundial as map/prayer/compass) muddle rather than layer meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from repetitive structures ("He would return... He recognized... He felt...") and occasional overwriting in figurative language. Information density is moderate; several passages could compress without loss ("Thus, as the harbor's fog lingered" adds little).

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwriting pervades peak moments—"love left hanging like ripe grapes on a vine too soon stripped" mixes vehicles awkwardly. Template cadence appears in "He knelt...He wrote...He sensed...He lifted...He placed." The phrase "geography of healing" repeats five times without variation. While individual sentences achieve moments of beauty, density often obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in the extended metaphorical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting with stacked metaphors ("stalactites that clawed the cavern ceiling like titanic, glassy fingers") and abstract descriptors bog down momentum. Template phrasing appears throughout ("From that day forward," "Thus the suspended palace"), and the final third especially suffers from declarative summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    While individual sentences often achieve lyrical beauty, the prose suffers from repetitive structures and conceptual loops. The phrase "scars can sing" appears three times with minimal variation, and multiple sentences follow the pattern of "She [verb], [metaphorical elaboration]." The dense figurative language in nearly every sentence creates fatigue rather than momentum, particularly in sequences like "each grain a stanza that sang of destruction turned into fertile ground."

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments like "cracked cobblestones whispering of ages lost" but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence appears in "She crouched...She placed...She then followed" sequence. The paraphrase loop between "forgotten fountains" and "no longer forgotten but remembered" weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("sonar pinging" appears 5 times, "falling petals" 4 times) and abstract descriptors that blur specificity. Template structures recur ("She [verb], [participial phrase]"). Mixed metaphors muddle clarity (gear as bridge/seed, light as ribbon/filament/cascade). Information density is uneven—some sentences merely restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose tends toward purple with mixed metaphors ("his mind was a fiercely meditative river") and repetitive elevated diction. "Thundering calm" recurs without variation or payoff. Sentences often strain for poetry over clarity: "The town's mourning was not a single wound but a flock of butterflies that fluttered through the years." Information density is compromised by ornamental language that doesn't advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant overwriting throughout: "molten rose hue, a searing reverie that painted the horizon with fire" stacks figurative language without clear image. Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same content: "incremental absolution" appears four times with near-identical meaning. Template cadence runs like "She + verb" dominate multiple paragraphs. The prose prioritizes ornate description over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. However, abstract phrases like "uncharted echoes of memory rise like mist" and "shape of intentions" recur without sufficient concretization, and some metaphors strain credibility ("compartments adjusted...like a lover's embrace" for an inanimate case).

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Some overwriting appears ("emerald curtains of the aurora," "silent sentinel") but doesn't obscure clarity. The phrase "groundedly imaginative" repeats three times without variation, and several sentences could be condensed without loss of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("fireflies trapped in amber") but suffers from repetitive constructions and some overwriting. "Thistled calm" appears three times without clear meaning; "secretly luminous" recurs without justification for the secrecy. Template phrases like "she sensed," "she felt," "she recognized" accumulate, and the adjective density occasionally obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting with figurative language in most sentences ("like broken hopes," "like frozen breaths," "like tiny constellations," "like soft snow," "like a closing eye") creates density without purpose. Template cadence appears in "She whispered...She lifted...She felt...She stood" construction, and the prose relies on abstract telling ("profound hush," "fleeting emotion") over concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in passages linking physical archaeology to philosophical inquiry. However, repetitive phrasing appears ("competing narratives" used 5 times, "ancient methods" 3 times) creating mild synonym churn. Template cadence emerges in "I [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, though rhythm varies adequately overall.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstraction and metaphorical density obscure concrete action: "threading golden threads through a tapestry of silence," "crucible," "velvet ambience seemed to breathe." Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the transformation sequence where "hatred rusting away," "tension loosened," and "bitter echoes" restate the same change. Template phrasing like "She knew," "She watched," "She understood" creates repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "panes bruised by time" and "soft applause" of falling leaves. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("cascade of comet light that brushed the greenhouse's metal ribs, turning rust into fleeting ruby veins") and the final paragraph contains explicit thematic statements that reduce subtlety. Some template phrasing around "gentle rebellion" recurs without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery—"lightning collection tower hummed with dormant energy"—with generally clean syntax. Information density is moderate, though phrases like "wound on the city's heart" and "weaving wonder back" lean toward abstraction. The recurring "nectar/honey" metaphor maintains coherence but appears frequently enough to edge toward overwriting in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant paraphrase loops undermine momentum: "hushed blaze" appears three times, "creeping normality noticer" twice, and the concept of houses feeling alive is restated rather than developed. Template cadence appears in "I walked... I found... I discovered... I bought... I placed... I felt... I realized... I left..." creating mechanical progression. The prose achieves moments of lyrical beauty but suffers from repetitive stems and conceptual redundancy that dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues: "cascading revelations" (4x), "structural weakness" (3x), "incisively kind" (3x), "welcomed nuance into a certainty" (2x), "foxglove-stained" (3x). Template cadence runs throughout ("The statue... The garden... The water..."). Overwriting in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff (-0.7). These artifacts pervade the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("dice...one scarred by a chip that caught the dim light like a wounded star") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "boundless confinement," "perpetual motion," and "missed chance/opportunity." The template structure "Thus he..." appears twice, and several sentences paraphrase the same concept of paradoxical balance. These loops diminish momentum despite generally clean grammar and varied sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("saffron-lit bridge where lost languages of gratitude were spoken without words") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears in "She painted...She brushed...She worked" sequences, and several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("methodically hopeful" appears three times with minimal variation).

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwrought figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff ("stories like brittle coins," "frozen heartbeat of culture"). Template structures emerge in parallel constructions ("L for Liora, M for the mute potter"). Information density suffers from abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, though the final paragraph achieves strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.3)
    Significant repetition issues plague the text: "bleak exhilaration" appears three times, "latent radiance" five times, "hunger stone" becomes a loop. Template cadence emerges in "He [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Some strong images like the yoyo encoding and gear teeth grinding partially offset these artifacts, but the prose needs substantial tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose artifacts pervade: template repetition of "lingering luminance" (7x), "photographically cursed" (5x), and "repulsive allure" (3x) creates mechanical patterning rather than purposeful accumulation. Mixed metaphors ("bleeding luminance," "syrup that clung to her throat") muddle clarity. Information density suffers from ornamental padding that doesn't advance story.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of musical precision but suffers from abstract terminology loops ("sketched resonance" appears 4 times, "restless euphony" 3 times) and occasional purple passages. Template cadence emerges in middle sections with repetitive "He [verb]" structures. Information density varies—some sentences merely restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance world, character, or atmosphere simultaneously. However, several instances of elevated diction clash with clarity ("bronze ribs of iron," "molten ribbon"), and some repetitive structures emerge ("She traced...She raised...She tucked"). The filter-verb cluster in the revelation sequence ("Mira understood...Mira realized...she vowed") dulls immediacy at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades critical beats: "ivy's vines formed arches that resembled cathedral naves" and "glass fragments of fractured memories" pile metaphors without advancing pressure. Template phrasing appears in "Arlen realized," "Arlen felt," "Arlen placed" repetitions, and the abstract register ("transparent honesty," "unblemished record") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades with metaphors in most sentences ("hushed blaze of damp copper," "skeleton fingers") creating density without purpose. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, and "interlaced absence" loops four times without added meaning, creating synonym churn that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues damage momentum: "antique ink stamp" (8x), "reclaimed stillness" (5x), "dappled resolve" (3x), "logical page indexer" (4x) create loops rather than resonance. Template cadence pervades ("She + verb" constructions dominate), and paraphrase loops appear throughout (the stamp's function is restated multiple times without advancement).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.4)
    While individual sentences achieve poetic resonance, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops ("luminous torment" appears four times) and abstract phrasing that reduces momentum. Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence without clear payoff creates overwriting, and several paragraphs could be removed without changing knowledge or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery, with lines doing multiple jobs (the opening sky both sets atmosphere and mirrors internal state). Some figurative density in peak moments ("constellation of hopes") works thematically but occasionally tips toward overwriting, and technical terms could integrate more smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting mars the prose: "brilliant dimness" appears four times, creating repetitive patterning. Abstract phrases like "frequency of belonging," "scattered fragments of identity," and "collaborative pulse of human curiosity" accumulate without concrete grounding. Template constructions ("She felt," "Lira felt," "Lira watched") create filter-verb stacks that distance the reader from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe redundancy problems throughout: "sieved hush" appears twice verbatim, the concept of "weight" recycles seven times without variation, and multiple sentences paraphrase the same idea ("hoping the tide of memory would wash away the lies" immediately follows nearly identical content). Template cadence runs dominate ("I accepted...I stepped...I began...I sought...I placed...I walked"). Abstract scaffolding ("reminder that," "promise to," "knowing that") clogs momentum. The phrase "weight of a withheld truth" appears three times unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues damage momentum: "furrowed hush" (3x), "antique drawer pull" (5x), "untethered/untethering" (4x), and multiple paraphrase loops ("The storm began to wane, and the sea's roar turned into a low, approving sigh" followed immediately by similar atmospheric resolution). Template cadence runs throughout ("He whispered... He offered... He felt... He departed...").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.1)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language in most sentences ("like sentinels," "like forgotten constellations," "like a lantern swaying"). Template cadence appears in repetitive "He [verb]" constructions. The phrase "backlash of regrets" repeats verbatim three times, creating conceptual redundancy rather than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from abstract loops ("labyrinth of choices" appears 4 times) and philosophical telling that slows momentum ("My motivation was simple yet profound"). Strong moments like "holding the ball felt oddly comforting, as if past and future pressed into my palm" demonstrate capability, but overwriting in phrases like "delicately robust promise" and repetitive "journey/labyrinth" constructions detract.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("moonlight painted the leaves silver," "air curled like a filament of starlight," "cosmos contract"). Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions, and abstract descriptors ("infinite embrace," "cosmic intimacy") replace concrete detail, creating momentum drag without purposeful pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("each fissure reflecting a fragmented memory") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff. Template structures appear ("She recalled...She whispered...She followed...She placed"). The phrase "choking beauty" repeats without evolution, suggesting scaffold rather than purposeful echo.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language ("photons like mournful fireflies," "sunrise on a blackened sea") that often obscures rather than clarifies. Template structures appear ("She whispered...She placed...She stepped"), and abstract phrasing like "impossible physics whispered through her bones" reduces clarity in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "whispering hush"/"vibrant hush" appears five times with minimal variation; "transformation" concepts repeat without deepening. Overwriting pervades peak moments ("each passing comet of light seemed to fulfill a fragment"), and the prose prioritizes atmospheric description over propulsive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting plagues the piece: "luminous fort at twilight loomed like a sleeping giant," "tiny constellations waiting to be read," "phosphorescent moss on damp stone." Nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern or payoff. Template cadence appears in "Kael placed...and the device emitted...that fluttered through...igniting quiet thoughts." The prose prioritizes ornament over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "lingering promise" appears 7 times, "borrowed dawn" 5 times, "painted rocks" 8 times, creating synonym loops rather than accumulation. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("She knew...She felt...She turned"), and abstract phrasing ("sacred patterns," "hidden rhythm") replaces concrete specificity in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("Lightning etched silver veins across the sky"), but suffers from paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy. The final six paragraphs essentially restate the cartography-of-scars transformation without added pressure, and abstract phrases like "vigil in pause" recur without evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("connor fingers whirring," "soundscape of dignified chaos"), template repetition of "hidden overture" (7+ instances), and abstract padding. "The riddle was simple yet profound" exemplifies the tell-heavy prose that substitutes assertion for dramatization. Information density remains low despite elaborate phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy reliance on abstract metaphors ("luminous fracture," "choir of voices," "architecture of hope") without concrete grounding. Template cadence appears in multiple passages ("Each night...," "Each newcomer..."). The prose prioritizes ornamental language over clarity, with mixed metaphors (library as both crucible and garden).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from density overload - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching ("tidal arbor," "staircase of clouds," "horizon stretched, a thin line of amber"). Template cadence appears in "He [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphors ("tide of clouds," "floating platform") muddle spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some figurative density clusters unnecessarily ("mosaic of ancient faces...like petals falling onto a still pond") and occasional template structures appear ("She realized...She understood...She watched"). The final third maintains momentum despite these minor frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive overwriting with mixed metaphors ("whispered instructions woven into an antique lace pattern"), abstract nominalizations ("tides of remembrance"), and template repetition of "rhythmically placid" dilutes clarity. Nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff. Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same concept of forgiveness/release across adjacent paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "garden ghosts," which feels slightly poetic against the otherwise precise scientific lexicon, but it does not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight thesaurus-churn effect in "steadily adaptive" and "drifting resonance" appearing multiple times, though the pattern is largely taught and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("frozen cathedral," "ghostly harp"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the climax without obscuring clarity. The final paragraph's cadence masterfully supports the Charged Poise closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exquisite with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("chased stillness" appears twice, risking decorative repetition). However, no loops or scaffold artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high. A minor, single-instance syntactic repetition ("amplified quiet") slightly dulls momentum but does not touch closure. No other artifacts or loops are present.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction for potential overwriting in the climax ("foggy lucidity," "symphony of healed hearts"), which slightly risks figurative muddle but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, often performing multiple jobs of advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. A minor deduction for occasional moments where the density of figurative language ("a quaking reverie that blended the scent of rain‑kissed earth with the distant echo of forgotten songs") slightly risks ornamentation, though it remains largely purposeful and legible. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor artifact is present: the phrase "staggering grace" is repeated, which, while thematically charged, creates a slight template cadence. This does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density, but figurative language stacks in high-pressure beats ("low, metallic lullaby," "tapestry woven from colors") creating minor coherence strain. No loops or scaffolding. Momentum remains strong, and closure is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for occasional over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("whispers," "liquid dusk") that slightly blurs immediacy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("weighty lightness" is repeated) and a template cadence in the narrated chant, which slightly dulls the immediacy of an otherwise powerful beat. Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for a subtle template cadence in the description of decoding ("backflips for circles, rolls for slashes, and breath holds for pauses") and a single instance of potential register drift ("a crystallized final moment"). Rhythm and propulsion are otherwise masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. However, a minor tendency toward overwriting and stacked modifiers ("storm-tossed," "ragged spine," "ambered hush") creates slight figurative density in early beats, though it remains coherent and does not obscure the closure. The sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and clear propulsion. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. There is a complete absence of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, and the final line resolves with a resonant image that recharges earlier motifs. A single, very minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrase "mundane mysticism," which briefly disrupts the concrete texture.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and purposeful, vivid prose. The rhythm is varied and supports the atmospheric build. A minor deduction for moments of slight overwriting or conceptual redundancy (e.g., "ambiguously clear" is used three times), which creates a faint textural loop, though it does not harm the crucial closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and highly textured, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally veers into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can slightly obscure clarity and momentum (e.g., "coaxing each crack to reflect the garden’s own tentative bloom"). This minor artifact is deducted here.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory propulsion and varied sentence structures. However, minor artifacts include repetitive paradoxical phrasing ("icy warmth," "mechanically warm") and a template cadence in describing vibrations and hums. These don't obscure closure but dull peak beats slightly. Figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "notes hung like ghosts," "sigh that seemed to echo the ghost's own breath") which, while beautiful, slightly risks ornamentation. However, it never obscures causality or closure clarity, and the sentence-level propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control, though a minor mixed metaphor occurs ("brittle leaf" and "stone" for certainty/truth). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, atmosphere, and plot. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for figurative language that, while largely effective, occasionally stacks in high-pressure beats ("a rusted artery of stone and neglect," "glimmered like frozen syllables") creating a slight strain on clarity. However, it never obscures the core causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats ("silence grew louder, regenerative and warm, humming against the cracks of his mind") which, while beautiful, slightly risks clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("ordinary magic" appears twice in quick succession) and a slight over-density of figurative language in the climax, though clarity is never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythmic control ("a bronze quiet rhythm that seems to echo the sigh of the stone arches"). However, figurative language is pervasive, appearing in most sentences, which slightly slows momentum in high-pressure beats (e.g., the description of the vaulted chamber). No loops or scaffold; clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing multiple layers. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("open secret spilling like the tide") and a slight template cadence in the opening prevent a higher score, but no artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward slightly elevated diction ("reverberations," "equilibrium") and complex figurative language creates minor opacity in a few peak beats, slightly dulling the immediate clarity of the closure moment without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation and high information density. A minor deduction for a tendency toward decorative phrasing in high-pressure beats (e.g., "baton of luminous sound"), which creates a slight figurative muddle without obscuring the crucial cause-and-effect of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle exists ("darkening brightness that seemed to swallow the lingering mist") and a template cadence emerges in a few adjacent sentences, slightly dulling clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, minor overwriting is present ("a tiny drumbeat against her skin"), and a few stacked modifiers ("lingering afterglow") slightly blur clarity in peak beats. The momentum is otherwise impeccable, with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on the phrase "layered tranquility" (three uses) which creates a subtle template cadence. Otherwise, information density is high, and figurative language is coherent and effective without muddying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("like mute witnesses," "echo of a summer evening") is purposeful and pattern-taught. Sentences vary in rhythm, breathing with the scene's emotional beats. One minor paraphrase loop occurs ("grieve not only for his mother but for every fragment of history"), but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like cracked shells," "like lost memories") creates minor decorative overload, slightly obscuring causal clarity at moments. No major loops or scaffold issues. The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, without muddle. There are no observable loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure clarity. A single, minor instance of slightly elevated diction ("magnificent simplicity") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat ("affectionate detachment flavored her movements"), which uses a near-abstract label, but the sentence-level propulsion and clarity remain excellent, and no artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythmic control. Minor line-level artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("cautious exuberance," "whimsically attentive") and a few instances of synonym churn ("gentle hush," "quiet shine"). However, these do not significantly obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is richly textured and generally purposeful, though a tendency toward dense figurative language ("luminescent ache," "webs of kinship") creates minor moments of overwriting that slightly slow momentum. The closing paragraphs are strong, with clear propulsion and a powerful final image. No major loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor figurative muddle occurs in phrases like "veins of pure possibility," which slightly obscures sense. A template cadence emerges in a run of "she [verbed]" constructions mid-story, but clarity and momentum are maintained, especially in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacting appears in a few adjacent lines of dense figurative language (e.g., "fruits that glimmered like pale lanterns" followed by "cloak brushing the mossy ground with a hush that seemed to listen"), creating a slight overlay that doesn't harm closure clarity. Momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and variation. However, figurative language is extremely dense, appearing in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("sapphire hush," "quiet arteries," "whispered songs"). This creates minor coherence strain and occasional register elevation in peak beats, though it never fully obscures closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. However, a template-cadence run appears ("He watched... He understood... He remembered..."), and the phrase "circuitously sincere" is repeated, creating a minor artifact that slightly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains momentum, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor figurative strain occurs in phrases like "inner fire that seemed out of place," but clarity is never compromised. Rhythm varies naturally, and the closure image lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush and highly descriptive, creating a strong atmospheric momentum. However, a pattern of repetitive phrasing emerges, particularly the recurrent use of "bright darkness" and "unseen forces," which acts as a slight textual artifact that dulls the closure image through over-insistence. The sentence-level rhythm is otherwise varied and purposeful, and information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric but maintains remarkable clarity and propulsion. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "reactively visionary" feels slightly label-like upon its introduction, though the trait is immediately demonstrated thereafter. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary, with high information density and varied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density and strong propulsion. Minor artifact: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("framed by ivy that seemed to breathe") creates occasional mild opacity, but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, though minor overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., "unheard symphony of stone, sea, and stars" risks abstraction). Rhythm and sentence variety are expertly controlled, propelling the accumulative density. A single hairline slip in figurative coherence prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "prismatic echoes") and a template cadence in the list of corridor descriptions. However, information density is high, and the language consistently advances character and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor instance of overwriting occurs in the peak beat: "liquefying her own rigid doubts and turning them into a fluid resolve" uses two metaphors for the same internal change, creating a slight paraphrase loop that slightly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("refract that hum, turning vibration into a spectrum of light"), which creates a momentary, slight figurative muddle. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere and character.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: the phrase "texture of memories" is repeated, creating a slight conceptual loop. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, often doing multiple jobs. However, figurative language is pervasive, creating some minor muddle in high-pressure beats (e.g., "needle trembling like a laugh caught in a storm"). This slightly obscures the clarity of the closure image, though the propulsion and rhythm remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. However, figurative language is occasionally over-dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "hopeful desperation that felt like a tide turning back"), creating a slight muddle that slightly dulls the closure image's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in a few peak beats (e.g., "a mute witness to a dawning hush that would soon become a memory" borders on redundant). However, the information density is high, and every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. The closure beat remains clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly sensory, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, figurative language is extremely dense, appearing in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("magnetic calm," "quiet sigh," "tiny prisms") without a clear pattern-teaching payoff, creating a minor but consistent artifact that slightly mutes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. However, a slight scaffold phrase ("a reminder that every river is born from ice") and a minor mixed metaphor ("its mirror-like hush amplifying the quiet dread") prevent a higher score. Information density is high, and every sentence advances atmosphere or story.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. There is a slight density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("lattice of silver," "sigh of the wind"), but it remains coherent and purposeful, serving the accumulative texture without creating muddle or obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and purposeful, vivid prose. There is a minor instance of near-paraphrase ("unsnarl the tight coil of panic"/"unsnarl of her own fear dissolve") which prevents a higher score, but it does not obscure closure. Rhythm and syntax are expertly controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, but suffers from minor text artifacts. A template-cadence run occurs with "The hush was a promise... The hush answered..." and a paraphrase loop exists in the description of the narrow door. These minor scaffold issues and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats prevent a higher score, though clarity at closure is unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats creates minor momentum drag, and a near-paraphrase loop occurs ("mournful elation" appears twice). Clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly rhythmic, with strong information density. A minor deduction for occasional overwriting and a clustered use of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "whispering a map of forgotten myths...sing a hauntingly optimistic lullaby") that slightly blurs sense, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A few instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("pale rivers of memory") and a template cadence in the list of her activities ("excavating a tomb, each layer...") create minor momentum drags, but these artifacts do not touch the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, but maintains clarity and propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. A minor deduction for one potential mixed metaphor ("whispered margins of humanity" slightly strains the sonic/visual logic) and a moment of elevated diction ("futuristic nostalgia") that, while apt, brushes against register purity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a pattern of slightly overripe figurative language in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "a canvas for secret maps," "a choir of suppressed voices") which, while beautiful, very slightly risks ornamentation over propulsion at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "veil that hovered like a second sky") which creates a minor drag on momentum. However, the line-level craft remains purposeful and advances the story.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. There is high information density, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for a potential artifact: the phrase "shared anxieties" appears multiple times, nearing thematic echo, though it is anchored in the concrete image of the mist and the coral's lattice, mitigating the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, but this sometimes slows momentum, particularly in the middle passages where figurative language stacks. A minor paraphrase loop occurs ("pensive mirth" is used three times). However, the closure beat remains clear and unaffected by these artifacts, and the sentence-level rhythm is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety and information density. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("cascade of miniature auroras") slightly slows momentum but does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating toward closure. Figurative language ("kaleidoscope of fragrant, humming possibilities") is pattern-taught and enhances atmosphere. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences ("whispered back... bending reality"), but no artifacts harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. However, minor overwriting occurs in peaks (e.g., "visual blossom armistice" feels slightly redundant). No loops or scaffolds, but a -0.3 deduction for figurative stacking in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lush and highly polished, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. A minor deduction for slight momentum drag caused by the intense figurative density in the opening beats, though this is largely a taught pattern. There are no loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances the atmosphere and story.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, figurative language is pervasive in high-pressure beats ("storm trapped in stone," "symphonies of truth"), creating minor density without pattern-teaching. This slight ornamental weight prevents a 9+ score, though closure remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythmic variation. Minor overwriting appears in a high-pressure beat: "a quiet revelation that the ancient architects had encoded to remind future builders of shared humanity" is slightly summary-like. However, this does not obscure closure, and the sentence-level propulsion remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("bloom with a withering grace") slightly muddles clarity but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose exhibits exceptional density and rhythmic control, with every sentence advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle or artifaction. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts—pure propulsion toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and highly evocative, with strong information density. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight synonym churn ("luminous respite," "firefly glow," "soft illumination") and one mixed metaphor ("a breath held in amber" slightly clashes with the aqueous setting).

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly polished, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language in high-pressure beats ("cheerful gloom," "rose-colored sigh") creates minor moments of register drift that, while beautiful, slightly soften the clarity of peak moments without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward dense figurative language ("calculated wilderness," "tiny compass pointing toward unexpected harmony") that, while beautiful, occasionally risks slight opacity. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language in high-pressure beats ("ink that glowed like distant suns") creates minor moments of opacity that slightly dull the immediacy of the closure, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, minor artifacts appear, such as the slightly over-stacked modifier "noctilucent reckonings" and a tendency toward complex syntax that, while beautiful, can momentarily stall momentum. The closure image remains clear and potent despite this minor density.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythmic control and information density. However, minor overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats, such as "fractured vessel might teach the world how to translate pain," which leans slightly abstract. No loops or scaffolding artifacts, and clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. However, minor figurative over-density and a tendency toward synonym churn ("serene upheaval," "lucidly watchful") create occasional scaffold artifacts, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly accomplished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a slight tendency toward decorative language in a few phrases (e.g., "green-threaded artery," "warm ash against her spine") that, while beautiful, momentarily risk overshadowing momentum. Overall, clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative muddle occurs in a high-pressure beat with phrases like "choir of tiny glass singers" and "invisible ribbons of hope," which slightly obscure clarity without full pattern-teaching, triggering a small deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, there is a minor instance of figurative stacking in the high-pressure beat describing the night ("flawed beauty," "amber glow fighting," "silver hush"), which slightly mutes the clarity of the closure image. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, though it flirts with overwriting in a few phrases ("a guide he had learned to read"). Rhythm is expertly controlled, accelerating into the release. One minor synonym churn ("fractured grace...forged from cruelty") slightly dulls the closure image but does not break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, but risks overwriting with frequent figurative language. While generally purposeful, some phrases ("sigh of a lover long gone") verge on decorative. The rhythm is controlled and supports the accumulative momentum, though clarity suffers slightly in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful but shows minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "strings of conscience unspooling from the puppets' wrists like ribbons of starlight"). This figurative stack slightly muzzles the closure's clarity, though momentum and rhythm are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. However, a tendency toward overwriting and slightly mixed metaphors ("painted the sky with orange whispers," "blushing curve") creates minor artifacts that dull the peak clarity, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with sentences doing multiple jobs: "The rope was centuries old, a ceremonial braid... its loops holding the memory of every prayer." Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the cascade of names and breathing in descriptive moments. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats but remains coherent and pattern-taught, without muddling clarity. A single paraphrase-loop ("forgotten names" repeated) costs a slight deduction, but closure remains untouched and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is often lush and rhythmic, but suffers from minor overwriting and figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the ethereal grit of the place seep into her bones"). This creates a slight loss of momentum and clarity, though it does not fatally obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts are present, including some repetitive phrasing ("frugal astronomer," "dusky harmony") and a tendency toward slightly overwrought description in places (e.g., "the air shivered"). These do not obscure closure but slightly dilute the line-level precision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("vaulted heart," "shifting grace") is purposeful and consistent. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or register drift. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though minor overwriting appears in phrases like "glass‑mountain tone of silence" which slightly muddles the vehicle. Rhythm is expertly controlled to match the breathing cadence, propelling the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor artifact appears in the climax: "accidental wisdom dripping onto the child’s mind" is a mixed metaphor that slightly muddles clarity in an otherwise precise passage. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "pond of starlight"), but it does not obscure closure clarity. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly evocative and maintains strong momentum, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor figurative muddle appears in the climax ("the unheard symphony swelled, as if the mountain itself were exhaling"), slightly softening the clarity of the closure image. Otherwise, craft is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and highly inventive, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. However, it occasionally veers into overwriting; a cluster of mixed metaphors in the high-pressure beat ("rusted chains of light," "cage and wind") creates a minor figurative muddle that slightly obscures clarity without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. However, a minor artifact exists: the phrase "fables of absence" is repeated several times, creating a slight synonym-loop effect that dulls immediacy in a high-pressure beat. This prevents a 9+ score, though clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and beautiful, purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction for a hint of overwriting in a few peak beats; phrases like "hammered repose" and "gently luminous" are effective but risk feeling slightly decorative upon repetition. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and the final paragraph lands with clarity and powerful resonance. No loops or scaffolding issues were found.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing ("thistle-blown hope" is repeated) which slightly inflates texture without always advancing sense, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, the prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally high, with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythmic control. A slight tendency toward synonym churn ("preemptively nostalgic," "lingering echoes") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("deepening hush" is used three times) prevents a higher score, though clarity is never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs with "filter the damp night air, turning breath into bright inspiration," which introduces a literal mechanical function for the rag that is never used again, creating a slight coherence issue. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with a masterful variation in sentence length and rhythm that mirrors the tidal setting. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly integrated ("script curling like the tide’s own handwriting"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts to obscure the crystalline closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and poetic but maintains clarity and propulsion, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the climb and breathing during the collection. There is a minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "intangibly tangible, a paradox," which edges toward theme statement, but it is quickly grounded in the doll's function. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "fractured lullabies") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("vaulting hush" is used three times). However, these do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, but occasional thesaurus-churn ("sallyed") and a cluster of compound adjectives in high-pressure beats trigger a minor artifact penalty. The closure image remains clear and potent, with strong rhythmic propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though it risks overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "conduits, thin threads of memory"). A single minor paraphrase loop exists ("burned bridges carefully" repeated) but does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion and rhythm are expertly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. Figurative language is often effective, though there is a minor tendency toward decorative description in a few phrases (e.g., "glitter like false gold"). The sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulating pressure well. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts were found.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, but the phrase "eloquently silent" is repeated three times, creating a template cadence that slightly dulls its impact. This is a minor artifact that does not touch the closure beat but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is highly dense and atmospheric, but this creates a textural artifact: the relentless figurative language, while often beautiful, occasionally slows momentum and obscures cause-and-effect clarity in high-pressure beats, such as the act of unsnapping the lock.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally exquisite with high information density. Minor artifacting occurs with slightly overwrought phrases like “unfurling like a silent flag” and “a pulse of hope humming through the dust,” which momentarily stall momentum. However, the line-level propulsion is strong, and the closure image is clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in the description of the transmission's effect and a slight synonym churn ("revising histories," "revised histories").

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly poetic but maintains clarity and propulsion. There is a minor risk of overwriting in the density of figurative language ("each breath a filament of color"), but it remains coherent and voice-motivated, serving the accumulative drive. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly deliberate, with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward decorative figurative language in high-pressure beats ("leaves that fell like ancient verses") creates minor density issues, preventing a top score.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs—e.g., "the water cascaded in silvery sheets, creating a mist that smelled of ozone and old iron." Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though "feeling a harmony" in the climax leans slightly abstract. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and concise with excellent rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the line "redemption was not a single transaction but a continuous negotiation," which edges into articulated summary in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, information density is high, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("sunrise glass") slightly muddles clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative overload in a few high-pressure beats ("ultraviolet penance demanded a price") causes slight register drift, but clarity is never obscured. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances character and atmosphere. The closure image remains sharp and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like an eternal instant"), slightly obscuring immediacy but not causality. No loops or scaffolding artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm ("shattered marquee flapped like a tired animal"). Minor deduction for slightly ornamental phrasing ("weightless burden") that does not obscure closure. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple jobs (e.g., the mainspring barrel sparks, casts light, and coaxes dust). No loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting and a cluster of figurative language in the high-pressure beat of the rupture ("echoing the sigh of a universe") creates a slight muddle, applying a deduction under the density check.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly poetic but risks overwriting in its density; a few phrases like "burnished sorrow" are repeated, creating a slight template cadence. However, the rhythm is masterful and supports the accumulative drive, and every sentence advances atmosphere and character. No clarity is lost at the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied sentence structure. There is a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing ("garden of iron vines") in a high-pressure beat, but it does not obscure causality or closure. The read-aloud rhythm is strong and supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control, though minor figurative stacking ("resonant hush," "liquid glass") in peak beats creates a slight decorative effect. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and there are no loops or scaffold artifacts to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. A minor, near-paraphrase loop occurs ("Through layered meanings" is used twice), and a slight rhythmic plateau emerges in the final third, but these do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("elongated shadows that danced with umbral tenderness"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Syntax and paragraph structure vary purposefully to support the accumulative rhythm and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density—e.g., "retrocognitively trapped" does triple duty. Rhythm is controlled, accelerating in the descent and broadening at closure. A minor deduction for slight register drift in phrases like "truth in tension" and "reverie," which feel abstract against the concrete imagery. Otherwise, no loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("fountain... of light, each beam a memory") slightly risks abstraction but does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly crafted with vivid, specific imagery and strong rhythmic variation. Minor overwriting in peak beats, such as "velvet disquiet" and "collective sighs," slightly inflates texture without advancing sense (-0.3). Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., the phonograph spinning lullabies while tending the orchard). No loops or scaffold; clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. Minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat with "furiously tranquil" and "wild serenity," which feel slightly declarative rather than fully embodied, costing a small deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, purposeful, and propulsive, with a varied rhythm that supports the accumulating tension. Figurative language is precise and character-motivated ("laying it aside like a retired hymn"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. The closing paragraph is a model of concise, resonant prose that lands the closure perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for a potential prose artifact: the phrase "flourishing stillness" is repeated, which, while thematic, slightly trends toward decorative use in its second instance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a tendency toward slightly overwrought phrasing appears in peaks, e.g., "the air hummed with a memory of honey no longer sweet" borders on decorative. This creates a minor text artifact that slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, figurative language becomes dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "time passing itself... thin silk"), creating minor coherence issues that slightly obscure clarity. This is a hairline slip that prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. However, minor artifacts exist: a template cadence emerges in lists ("shards of glass, forgotten songs, and the soft sighs of gulls") and a near-paraphrase loop occurs with "woven dawns" repeated frequently. These do not fatally obscure closure but slightly dull the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("gently systematic," "brazen calm") and a near-paraphrase loop between "brazen calm" and "inspired others to ignore fear."

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative, with strong sentence-level propulsion. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like a chemical fingerprint," "like a metronome"), creating a mild stacking effect that slightly blurs immediacy at the peak. However, clarity is never broken, and the closure image remains potent.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for occasional overwriting in peak beats, such as "narrow vastness" appearing multiple times, which slightly dulls the closure image through repetition. However, the language is largely precise and purposeful, advancing the story without scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and enhances clarity rather than obscuring it ("letters trembling like fireflies in a storm"). There is a single, minor instance of potential synonym churn ("whispered myths and reclaimed hope") but it does not harm momentum or closure. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished and vivid, but the opening paragraph's density of metaphor ("glass cradle," "taffy," "lingering breath") slightly obscures immediacy and momentum. The language becomes more propulsive and integrated with action from the second paragraph onward.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. However, a minor figurative muddle appears in the climax: "soul expand like a sunrise" is a mixed image (internal/external, abstract/concrete). The sentence "He whispered a promise..." is slightly scaffold-like, restating prior thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and sensory detail, though occasionally dense ("benevolently ruthless resolve"). Figurative language is generally purposeful, but phrases like "nomadic penumbra" risk slight abstraction. No loops or scaffolding issues; momentum is well-maintained through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potential overwriting occurs in the peak beat: "the pages unfolded not with ink but with the very scent of home—pine, rain, and the distant echo of her mother’s lullaby." The stacked sensory claims slightly risk abstraction but are rescued by their concrete particulars and connection to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and clear propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and varies naturally. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "fierce repose" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence, but it does not measurably obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Some overwriting appears in high-pressure beats ("refracting the sunrise into a kaleidoscope"), causing minor figurative muddle, but clarity at closure is unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong information density and varied sentence openings. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("narrative grew stronger, a bulwark of purpose against the void") slightly muddles clarity. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is generally coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but suffers from minor overwriting and a tendency toward stacked modifiers ("intimate aloofness," "labyrinthine caves") that create slight density without payoff. The rhythm is otherwise purposeful and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control, but suffers from minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "screaming tenderness" risks abstraction). There is no scaffold or loop artifact, and clarity is maintained, but the figurative language occasionally strains towards purple prose without fully obscuring cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and no loops. Figurative language is pattern-taught (moon phases, patina) and pays off. Minor artifact: "geography of loss" appears twice, but not in peak beats, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though occasional stacked modifiers ("broken cathedral of fruit") risk slight blurring. Rhythm accelerates with storm surges and breathes in reflective moments. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; clarity remains intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for a potential instance of overwriting or figurative density in the phrase "a canvas upon which the stranger had painted a fleeting hope," which slightly risks abstraction in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in a few phrases ("lingering promise tighten around his chest like a rope") slightly dulls peak beats, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "lacy menace"), though it remains coherent and largely serves the accumulative mode. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. The deduction stems from the same minor artifact noted in Q6: the repetitive use of "returning differently" acts as a synonym loop that slightly dulls the closure's immediacy. This is a small but noticeable flaw in an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and dense, though a few metaphors verge on over-stacked ("letters rearrange themselves as if jealous"). However, rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with emotional pressure, and there are no loops or scaffolds that obscure causality. The closure image lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation. A minor deduction for a slight over-density of figurative language in the second half (e.g., "conduit for love's first sigh"), which momentarily risks veering into ornamentation. However, the line-level propulsion never stalls, and clarity is maintained through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, yet maintains clarity and propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful (e.g., quill crystallization). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the crystallization beat and slowing with the release. One minor loop: "held breath" appears twice in close succession, but it is a taught pattern and thus not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush and often beautiful, but suffers from minor overwriting. Figurative language is occasionally stacked ("turning the sheet music into a living map of regret... ghostly fingers"), creating a muddle that slightly obscures clarity. Rhythm is generally strong, but these artifacts prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and highly accomplished, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting, such as "a relic that whispered the names of stars long extinguished" followed closely by another metaphor, creating a slight density artifact in a high-pressure beat. The closure, however, remains clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught ("heartbeat of the world," "breath of stone"). A single minor artifact: the phrase "the measure he sought was not a number but a feeling" slightly paraphrases the preceding realization, creating a small loop. Rhythm and syntax are expertly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with a strong, varied rhythm and high information density. There is a minor tendency toward abstract phrasing in reflective moments (e.g., "physics of letting go"), but this is largely voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity. The closure image is sharp and unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally lucid and propulsive, with high information density. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in "clover melancholy," a slightly strained metaphor that doesn't fully cohere with the established sensory logic. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts were found.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and poetic concision. The prose advances story and atmosphere simultaneously, as in "the disc would spin in a perfect loop, its ghostly arpeggios looping back on themselves like a question without answer." A minor, hairline slip exists in a repetitive stem ("loop" used closely twice).

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic propulsion. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats ("taste of both dread and delight"), but it is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. No loops or scaffolding artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor thesaurus-churn appears in phrases like "captive star" and "emerald tangle," creating slight register drift in peak beats, but clarity remains intact. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, advancing story and character without momentum loss or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; figurative language is pattern-taught and supports the accumulative design. Minor register drift in "quiet blaze of inner light" is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly dense and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing story, character, and atmosphere. Rhythm varies effectively, particularly in the description of the data streams. A slight deduction for minor figurative density in the final third ("like a slow tide"), though it does not obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exquisite, with high information density and poetic precision. Sentences like "each ripple a silver sigh" do multiple jobs of atmosphere, character, and theme. There is no scaffold or loopiness; every image advances the narrative. A single minor deduction for the slightly summary-like description of the harbor's listeners ("fishermen... dolphins") which briefly abstracts the effect of the music.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though minor artifacts appear: "volcanic tenderness" is a slightly mixed metaphor, and "analytically intuitive" risks label-speak. No loops or scaffold; momentum remains strong through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional over-density in figurative language ("auroral sorrow") and a slight register drift in peak beats, but momentum and clarity are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A very minor instance of potential scaffold exists ("He smiled, realizing..."), but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure. The language is precise and propulsive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with high information density. However, minor artifacts are present, including some repetitive phrasing ("shutters of water") and a tendency toward stacked modifiers that occasionally blur sense without harming closure clarity. The rhythm is generally purposeful and supports the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished, with excellent rhythm, vivid imagery, and high information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some high-pressure beats (e.g., "each unspoken word settle like a pawn awaiting promotion"), which creates a mild density without a clear pattern-teaching payoff. However, the language never obscures causality or closure, and the final paragraphs are flawlessly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting exists ("moon-struck daggers" feels slightly ornamental), but it does not obscure causality or closure. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple layers of story and atmosphere without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly polished with minimal artifacts. A minor instance of potential synonym churn ("remade hush... silence... quiet transformation... new hush") is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design, thus not penalized. Sentences advance multiple jobs of story, character, and atmosphere with concision.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety and information density. Minor instances of overwriting or synonymous phrasing ("tremor of certainty ripple... tremor of certainty settle") create slight texture loops but do not obscure closure clarity or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but generally purposeful and advancing the story. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. A minor deduction for occasional overwriting and stacked metaphors that slightly blur sense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "cadence of shadows and the whisper of metal"). However, no major loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "strand bearing a subtle hue of memory") but remains coherent and purposeful, serving the accumulative mode. There is a single instance of potential scaffold in "powerfully gentle," but it is a taught character trait and is not repetitive enough to trigger a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. A single, minor paraphrase loop exists ("curtains of intention" is explained within two lines), but it does not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a subtle template cadence emerges in a run of sentences starting with "She" in the middle section, and a minor figurative strain exists in "the journal’s pages fluttered like restless crowds," slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and purposeful variation in sentence structure. However, minor artifacts appear, including a tendency toward abstract, summary-like language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "atoms of nostalgia coalesce") and a few mixed metaphors ("cascade of light descended like liquid memory").

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and generally clear, but suffers from minor overwriting and a clustered figurative language artifact in high-pressure beats (e.g., "metamorphose his perception, letting the past and present merge like watercolor skies"). This creates a slight muddle and momentum drag, though it does not fatally obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.6)
    Line-level craft is exemplary, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the closure effect. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Syntax and rhythm accelerate and breathe in perfect step with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, precise imagery. A minor artifacting occurs with the slightly repetitive "meteor hush" (used three times), which slightly dulls the final recurrence but does not obscure closure. Information density is high, and every sentence advances the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense and poetic yet maintains perfect clarity and propulsion, with every sentence advancing the story. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, even in peak beats. The read-aloud rhythm is varied and hypnotic, supporting the story's accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and highly polished with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is pervasive, appearing in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats, which slightly blunts the peak clarity and momentum (-0.3). A single instance of potential synonym churn ("shadowed rapture wrapped his senses, a darkness scented with hope") applies a minor deduction (-0.3). The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, with every sentence advancing atmosphere and story. A slight risk of overwriting is present in the mid-section ("wave functions," "divergent archive's trembling pages"), but it is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops or scaffolding obscure the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a pattern of repetitive phrasing ("hum of insight," "wind through different trees") that, while thematically resonant, creates a slight template cadence in a few beats, marginally dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact exists: a cluster of filter verbs ("feeling," "reminded," "understanding") in high-pressure beats slightly dulls immediacy. This precludes a 9+ score, but the closure image remains clear and unaffected, and the lyrical voice is otherwise consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and figurative but maintains clarity and propulsion, with high information density. No significant loops or artifacts obscure the closure. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, effectively modulating with the story's contemplative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyrical, high-density prose with strong rhythm. Minor figurative over-density in places ("a hushed cathedral of stone and dust," "almost planetary") slightly slows momentum but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of telling ("Mara realized...") in a high-pressure beat slightly interrupts the otherwise flawless dramatization, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a subtle pattern of slightly elevated diction in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "reclaimed hearts," "quiet blaze") that creates a faint register drift from the otherwise perfectly calibrated voice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density. Rhythm is varied and supports the ritual's cadence. Minor artifacts include a slightly over-stacked metaphor ("its tail fluttering like a broken prayer") and a near-paraphrase loop on "whisper"/"chorus," but these do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, though slightly overwritten in places ("quietly talented gait"). Minor scaffold in repetitive "crumpled photograph" mentions. No artifacts harm closure; final paragraph lands with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "loose threads of narrative, each one whispering a different shade of possibility") which, while beautiful, slightly risks coherence. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are sustained, with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for potential overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "shimmer like a dying star," "vapor of memory") which, while beautiful, slightly risks figurative density obscuring immediate clarity. However, the propulsion and information density remain high, and no loops or scaffolds are present.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor artifacts: "dizzying quiet" is repeated, and the phrase "bravely conflicted" is used twice, creating a slight template cadence that dulls peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., "engraved quiet etched into the canvas like a prayer"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with Lira's actions and breathing with reflective moments. A −0.1 deduction for subtle template cadence in the repeated "tranquil blaze" phrase (three instances), though it serves pattern payoff. No figurative muddle or loops obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but figurative language is pervasive, particularly in high-pressure beats. This creates a density that, while often beautiful, occasionally borders on overwriting and slightly obscures clarity, incurring a deduction under the overwriting checks.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "orbits of regret that anchored the city’s most whispered conspiracies"), creating a slight strain on clarity but not obscuring causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("the meteor hush tone that had always lingered like distant static finally settled into a calm"), which slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and propel the narrative forward ("Each line was a question, each curve a tentative answer"). A minor instance of slightly ornate phrasing ("shimmering like a captured sigh") prevents a perfect score, but overall, the prose is polished and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the climax ("cascade of light that stitched the broken sky"), though it remains coherent and voice-motivated. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Momentum is maintained through concrete, advancing sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly figurative but purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. It maintains momentum and clarity even at peak density. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("synesthetically blessed") appears early but is quickly subsumed by concrete, embodied description.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structure. Figurative language ("willowglass hope") is consistent and purposeful, not ornamental. There are no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The final line's rhythm and image effectively resolve the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. Minor deductions for a tendency toward dense figurative language in some high-pressure beats ("lantern-like droplets," "heartbeat" pulse) which, while beautiful, slightly risks clarity and leans toward ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight pattern artifact: the phrase "quietly inspired" is repeated, functioning more as a label than a dramatized trait, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical, high-density prose that generally advances the story. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "breath forming fleeting glyphs") which, while beautiful, momentarily risks clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few phrases ("spindrift serenity that seemed to percolate") which creates a small figurative muddle, though it does not significantly harm closure clarity. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting appears in a few peak beats (e.g., "the sharp gentleness of this rebirth, a precise kindness that cuts through the heat yet soothes the soul"), creating a slight figurative muddle that slightly dulls closure clarity. Otherwise, propulsion and clarity are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifact: a paraphrase loop exists between "quivering hush lingered" and "hush that trembled," and the phrase "moon's argent ribbon" feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., "atomically reflective" is repeated, and "brittle awakenings" risks becoming a thematic label). A slight figurative density in the climax slightly dulls the closure image, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing ("sequined ribbons," "prismatic quiet") creates slight ornamentation in high-pressure beats, preventing a higher score. The closure image remains clear and unaffected by this minor flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional near-duplicates ("cautiously hopeful" appears three times) and a slightly ornate phrase ("the ethereal grit of the world settle into a steady beat") that feels slightly abstract at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, generally advancing the story. Some overwriting exists ("prudently adventurous," "spatial mutiny"), creating minor artifacts that slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with high information density. However, figurative language becomes overly dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "lance the void of forgotten sorrow"), creating minor coherence issues and a sense of overwriting that slightly obscures immediacy. The rhythm is otherwise strong and supports the accumulating texture.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is densely poetic and generally purposeful, though it occasionally leans into overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "paradox she wore like a coat"). The rhythm is controlled and supports the accumulative pressure. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) for the "paradox" line and a cluster of abstract nouns in the opening graph, which slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly dense and poetic, with strong rhythmic control. However, this density borders on overwriting in a few high-pressure beats, with a run of figurative language that slightly muddles immediacy (e.g., "every note is a map," "emptiness felt like a photograph," "heart hammered with luminous disbelief"). This prevents a higher score, though clarity at closure is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for a subtle pattern of repetitive stems describing his calm ("polished calm," "perceptively calm") and a single instance of a mixed metaphor ("soaring optimism and sudden panic... like a steady lantern").

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythm, but figurative language occasionally stacks ("curling like a sigh," "glowed like distant lanterns"), risking minor clarity loss in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; momentum remains propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. A minor instance of paraphrasing ("unbend a frozen confession" / "unbending the rigid grip") prevents a perfect score but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "swirling with the luminous threads of hope"). A -0.6 deduction for figurative density that slightly obscures immediacy, though it does not break closure. Rhythm and syntax are otherwise controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor figurative overload in the opening. The phrase "reckless idealism that glittered against the dust‑laden air" is a mixed metaphor that slightly obscures clarity. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion and information density are high, with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density and clear propulsion, though slight overwriting risk in phrases like "confidently uncertain" and "measured and boundless" creates minor figurative muddle. No loops or scaffolds obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines often doing multiple jobs. A minor instance of potential register drift ("a living proof of her theory") slightly clashes with the otherwise consistent voice, but does not harm closure clarity. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language in some sentences ("like a sunrise trapped in stone") creates minor opacity and a slight momentum drag in high-pressure beats. The closure beat remains clear and potent, saving the score from a larger deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward decorative phrasing in the opening that, while beautiful, slightly slows initial momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly evocative and dense with purpose. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with the emotional beats. A minor artifact is detected: the phrase "daringly methodical" is used three times, creating a slight template cadence. However, this does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor figurative overcrowding in high-pressure beats (e.g., "halos that danced like murmurs of forgotten verses"). This creates a slight drag on momentum and clarity, preventing a higher score despite otherwise strong rhythm and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly evocative and generally propulsive. Minor overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a perforated destiny, a map of choices broken into tiny holes like frost on glass" is slightly redundant). Rhythm is controlled, and the final line lands with powerful clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density and clear propulsion, though minor repetition occurs ("lucidly watchful" appears twice). Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and varied.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "heart scalloping," "leaves rustling like distant applause"), which, while beautiful, creates a density that slightly slows momentum. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues are present.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction for a tendency toward slightly overwrought figurative language (e.g., "shoulders cloaked in the weight of others' unresolved guilt") which, while beautiful, occasionally borders on ornamentation in high-pressure beats without adding causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor figurative muddle occurs in a few phrases (e.g., "like sycamore breath at dawn" slightly mixes metaphors). A template cadence is briefly evident in a run of simile-heavy descriptions, but this does not obscure cause/effect or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density with clear propulsion, no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught and functional, e.g., "birds' wings cutting the thin air like knives." Syntax varies purposefully with emotional intensity, though minor register drift occurs in "wander between shadow and stone."

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Sentences are propulsive and densely layered, advancing multiple story elements at once. A minor artifact occurs with the phrase "brilliant dimness," a near-oxymoron that, while thematically intentional, slightly strains clarity at a peak moment. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional, with no loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely exquisite with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "a quiet river of stars," "sleeping leviathan") where figurative language stacks, creating a minor momentum drag without fully obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence openings and rhythms. Few artifacts: minor scaffold in "stellar doubt" repetition (-0.2). Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, with closure beats remaining clear.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.6)
    Exemplary line-level craft. The prose is dense and poetic yet maintains perfect clarity and propulsion. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and never muddled. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. Rhythm and syntax are meticulously controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs, particularly in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor artifact: the repetition of "lukewarm" (mage, magic, hum) feels slightly templated rather than pattern-taught. A single instance of potential synonym churn ("resolve" followed by "resolve" in consecutive sentences). These do not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a slight over-reliance on reflective imagery ("mirrored hush," "mirrored glass") creates a minor pattern that, while coherent, slightly softens the tactile impact of the final beats. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush and highly descriptive, achieving strong rhythmic control and sensory vividness. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language ("light flickering like the heartbeat of the orchard") in high-pressure beats creates minor moments of overwriting that, while not obscuring causality, slightly slow the momentum leading into the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor figurative muddle occurs in phrases like "soundless echo," which slightly obscures immediacy. The sentence "The night around him seemed to fold inward" risks mild abstraction. These are hairline slips in an otherwise exceptional line-level execution that maintains propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and highly stylized, with strong rhythmic control. There is minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "numbness cracking like ice"), but it remains coherent and serves the story's mythic tone. No loops or scaffolding artifacts were detected.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor instances of overwriting or slightly strained metaphor appear (e.g., "the sky itself had decided to hold its breath," "rewrite the night itself"), creating a subtle decorative density in a few high-pressure beats that slightly dulls immediacy without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, this density borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats, with a cluster of complex metaphors ("blade of sound," "vortex of sound," "macerate the heavy silence") that slightly muddle clarity and momentum near the climax. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent, and the final paragraph lands with clean, powerful cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with excellent rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact appears in the peak beat: the phrase "interiorizing exteriors" is a near-abstract nominalization that slightly disrupts the otherwise embodied texture. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the powder glowed faintly, a trembling hue that mirrors the frozen bloom of twilight"). A minor template cadence appears in successive "He verbed" constructions during the experimental beats, but this is pattern-taught and pays off in closure. No figurative muddle or loops obscure causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and dense, with high information density and rhythmic control. Read-aloud quality is strong. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a cluster of complex figurative language in the opening sentence ("hung like a broken harp"), which, while pattern-taught, creates a slight momentum drag at the very start. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the peak beat ("waves that tangled with the wind, forming a lattice of sound that glimmered like phosphorescent threads"), which momentarily risks obscuring clarity, though it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "realistically imaginary choreography," but the figurative language remains coherent and serves the accumulative pattern. No loops or scaffold; closure clarity is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. Sentences are propulsive and densely layered, advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("its cold iron glinting as a reminder of surface voyages now half-forgotten"). Figurative language is precise and coherent, never muddying sense. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. The prose achieves a somber, marveling tone that is perfectly sustained to the final, resonant line.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and information density. However, some figurative language strains coherence ("the sky itself whispered through the stone") and creates minor muddle. A template cadence emerges in adjacent sentences starting with "The" in the opening. These artifacts are minor and do not touch the closure beat, but they prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; the density of figurative language in some beats (e.g., "hulking mouth," "jellyfish bellies") slightly risks obscuring immediacy, though sense remains clear. The sentence "The room seemed to inhale" is a near-paraphrase loop of the earlier "as if the ocean itself had inhaled," triggering a minor deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. Minor register drift in peak beats ("crystalline whispers") is slight and does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, voice-motivated, and serves the accumulative drive; there are no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors to obscure the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the pulse of static. A minor tendency toward decorative phrasing ("gravitationally playful echo") creates slight figurative overload in the denouement, but closure clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with sentences that advance multiple jobs of story, character, and atmosphere. Rhythm is expertly controlled. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "resonantly soft" is repeated four times, creating a slight template cadence. However, this repetition is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, and it does not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. Rhythm varies naturally with the scene's needs. Minor overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("a thunderstorm in a bottle, the roiling clouds sealed by glass and a whispered promise") slightly muddles clarity, triggering a small deduction. Otherwise, no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional density that borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "echoing a misting hush that seemed to breathe"), though it does not obscure closure. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles; every sentence advances atmosphere and story.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and vivid imagery. Rhythm is varied and purposeful. A very minor instance of potential register drift ("hyperbolic transformations") feels justifiable within the voice but slightly strains the POV's immediate lexicon. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and highly textured, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, minor artifacts slightly dull momentum: a tendency toward synonym churn ("cipher of longing," "secret language," "unspoken wishes") and a register that occasionally drifts into the overly decorative. These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but risks figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "tapestry woven from forgotten dreams"). Rhythm is masterful, with sentence-level propulsion accelerating toward the unbinding. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent, similarly structured sentences describing the lock's properties, but clarity is never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with sentences advancing multiple layers (e.g., "Each rusted mast pointed toward a fragment of a story"). Minor template cadence in consecutive "Each..." sentences and a slight filter-verb stack ("she realized," "she felt") in the climax, but clarity remains uncompromised. No mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "fractured into a thousand luminous shards" could be tighter). No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language generally serves pattern-building despite occasional density.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with high information density. However, figurative language is pervasive, occasionally bordering on overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "mist like liquid amber," "radiant hush"). This creates minor moments of opacity that slightly dull the closure image, though momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, but risks density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a lucid unrest, a calm yet uneasy feeling"). A few sentences border on overwriting, slightly muddying the crystalline clarity required for the highest band, though rhythm and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few phrases ("pallid white drizzle," "stone echo on the hill") that, while voice-motivated, slightly blur sense. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion is strong and supports the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "the physics of letting go revealed itself as a gentle equation"), introducing a minor figurative muddle. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent, advancing story and character with high density.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly poetic, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; the density of figurative language in some beats ("a tinkersong of electric hues") slightly obscures immediacy and momentum, though it never fully breaks coherence or harms the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("like a frozen lighthouse," "warm sunrise over the cold walls") is purposeful and vivid without becoming muddy or overwhelming. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and purposeful variation in rhythm. A minor deduction for occasional dense figurative clusters in high-pressure beats, though they largely cohere and serve the Accumulative drive without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“like a sunrise trapped in timber”) is purposeful and coherent, serving the accumulative pattern. Sentence-level rhythm varies masterfully with the scene’s urgency, from the “heightened stillness” of opening to the accelerated cadence of the demolition. No artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for mild figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like a choir of distant birds" following "echoing") and a single instance of potential synonym churn ("stranded luminance" vs. "stray halo").

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative over-density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "filament of light that curled like a whisper"), creating a slight muddle that slightly dulls immediacy without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is largely strong and purposeful, with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward slightly ornate phrasing ("trembling like a heart beat in the mist") and a synonym loop ("strangely trustworthy," "quiet promise," "strange surge of trust"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score. Information density is high, and every sentence advances atmosphere or story.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor instance of overwriting occurs in the peak beat ("a bruised awe that both soothed and scorched her nerves"), where a slightly contradictory metaphor slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure moment, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor register drift occurs with "patient surgeon," which feels slightly elevated for the POV, but it is an isolated instance that does not harm closure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and purposeful with high information density. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports pressure. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "symphonically minded" which, while character-consistent, edges toward academic lexicon in opening. No loops or artifacts; rhythm is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is exquisite, with high information density and superb rhythmic control. It largely avoids loops and scaffold, though a minor instance of synonym churn exists ("unspoken potential" / "dormant scripts"). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, serving to advance the story's atmosphere and concepts without muddying clarity, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. There is a minor risk of overwriting in the density of figurative language ("bitter as burnt cumin, yet underscored with a bright citrus"), but it remains coherent, voice-motivated, and ultimately serves the accumulative design. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts impede momentum or clarity, especially at the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but minor overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats with stacked metaphors ("like a mother guiding a newborn through storm"). A slight register drift in phrases like "empathetically decisive" feels mildly diagnostic, though it does not obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A minor prose artifact: a run of sentences with "quaking reverie" and "chaotically precise" creates a slight template cadence. This does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the repeated phrase "seeds of vigilance" borders on becoming a slightly decorative motif. Sentences propel the story forward without scaffolding or loops. A minor deduction for this slight repetition, which does not significantly obscure clarity but prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly lyrical and controlled, with excellent rhythm and variation. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "symphonically minded belief that sound could stitch silence" feels slightly redundant). However, information density is high, and no loops or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is elegant and controlled, with high information density. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("hopeful melancholy humming in his veins" risks slight abstraction). No loops or scaffold artifacts, but a register drift toward the lyrical slightly softens peak clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly lyrical and largely effective, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, slight overwriting and a tendency toward ornate phrasing ("collective exhale," "midnight roses") create minor density in high-pressure beats, slightly obscuring momentum without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but suffers from minor overwriting. The repeated use of "olfactorily sensitive" is a template cadence artifact. Figurative language is sometimes overstacked, e.g., "like a secret garden suspended in the sky" followed closely by another simile.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats (e.g., "fruit floated like quiet balloons," "leaves that glittered like emerald fire") and the repetitive use of "whirling silence," which creates a mild template cadence without a clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor template cadence appears in sentences starting with "She [verbed]" in the opening paragraph. Figurative language is well-controlled and purposeful, though the "nervous heart" simile is a slight cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush and highly figurative, but the pattern is taught and consistent with the POV, preventing it from feeling ornamental. There is high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight risk of overwriting in the final paragraphs, where the thematic resonance is perhaps reiterated one beat too many, creating a subtle loss of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts exist: "avalanchingly quiet" is a mixed metaphor that slightly muddles sense, and a near-paraphrase loop occurs between "canyon hush" and "swallow the distant rumble." These do not seriously harm closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats, creating occasional density that slightly obscures immediacy and momentum (-0.3). Despite this, information density is high, and the closure image remains powerful and clear. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight risk of abstraction in phrases like "germinate curiosity," though this is largely anchored by concrete action. The prose is largely free of loops, scaffolds, and figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight risk of overwriting in the peak beat ("whispered a chant of truth wrapped in paradox, each syllable a truthful lie"), though the figurative language is coherent and serves the theme. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor decorative repetition (e.g., "stoically sparkling") and a tendency toward slightly over-stacked modifiers ("raveling silence that crept... unweaving sound itself"). The rhythm is strong and propulsive, though these minor artifacts prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong information density. Rhythm is purposeful and varies effectively. A minor artifact is the near-synonym loop "quietly determined" and "deliberately," which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is generally coherent and supports the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifacting penalty for the repeated use of "cyclically spontaneous" which, while thematically relevant, creates a slight template cadence. No loops or scaffold obscure closure; the final image is clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without artifice. Sentences propel the accumulative rhythm ("stacking smooth river stones in a precise spiral"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image is sharp and earned. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally with the scene's emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a template cadence emerges in a few consecutive sentences starting with "The" in the final third, and the phrase "shadowed elation" is repeated, slightly dulling its charged specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a pattern of stacked modifiers and slight figurative overload ("quietly explosive" used thrice) creates minor artifacts that, while not obscuring closure, prevent a flawless score. The read-aloud ear test is mostly passed with variation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact exists: the phrase "quantified sorrow" is repeated and risks feeling slightly abstract or label-like before being embodied. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure but prevents a top-tier score. Sentence-level propulsion and clarity are otherwise exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly patterned, with excellent rhythmic control and high information density. A minor artifact penalty (-0.1) for a slight register drift in the final thematic line, which briefly adopts a more analytical tone compared to the predominant lyrical mode, slightly dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely lush and purposeful, with high information density. However, figurative language occasionally stacks into slight overwriting ("a chorus urging him"), and a template cadence emerges in a run of sentences starting with "He" in the middle beats. These minor artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a template cadence with repetitive "the creeping normality noticer" stems and a slight synonym churn between "tenuous" and "fragile" in the closure beats. However, these do not obscure the clarity of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled with superb rhythm and variation. A minor instance of template cadence exists ("Each measured degree..."; "The glow unfolded...") but does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, serving the atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, though the phrase "comforting unease" is repeated three times, creating a slight template cadence that dulls its impact. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and vivid, advancing story and atmosphere with high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is densely poetic and largely effective, with high information density. However, figurative language is pervasive, bordering on overwrought in some beats (e.g., "lavender scent curled like a soft binary code"). This creates minor coherence issues and a slight drag on momentum, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences serving multiple functions. A minor deduction for a pattern of slightly over-written figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "seep into the stone like living veins," "light braided with sorrow"), which creates a faint rhythmic predictability without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language serves pattern and payoff. Minor register drift in final paragraph ("testament") prevents higher score. No loops or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor scaffold appears in the repetition of "glisten" and "seasonally mute," creating a slight template cadence. However, the figurative language is coherent and purposeful, and the closure image lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("like origami," "like fractured glass") is purposeful and coherent. Rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the scene's tempo, from the throbbing dome to the quiet hiss of containment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory density. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "the metal’s cool memory press against her palm," which slightly obscures immediacy. A few sentences could be more concise, but there are no major loops or scaffold artifacts. The closure image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is pervasive, occasionally risking overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "The notion of time unfolded as a spider spins its web"). A minor paraphrase loop exists between "calm defiance" and "quiet rebellion," but it does not obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative drive. There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with the scene's needs, particularly in the climactic reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "tranquil blaze of purpose") which introduces a mild figurative density, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "flecting hymn," "pulse with an ancient rhythm"), applying slight figurative pressure without fully obscuring clarity. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. The opening and closing lines are exceptionally strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative density artifact appears in the climax: "burst into visible chords" is a slightly mixed metaphor (auditory/visual) following the established "lattice" and "library" imagery. This does not significantly obscure closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a template cadence in the final paragraphs (repetition of "calibrated treason," "wisely enduring") and one potentially mixed metaphor ("the sky itself mourned and celebrated").

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without mixed metaphors. A minor deduction for occasional high density in peak beats, but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and highly atmospheric, but this density occasionally flirts with overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "loom of memory," "choir of quiet light"). While generally purposeful, a few phrases slightly blur sense, preventing a higher score. Momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is exceptionally vivid and dense, with high information density. However, a tendency toward ornate description ("scintillatingly somber rhythm," "demure audacity") creates minor artifacts that, while voice-motivated, occasionally slow momentum. The sentence-level propulsion is generally strong, and the final paragraphs achieve powerful clarity and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor rhythm issue exists in the climax: the sentence "Mira felt a pulse in the air, a subtle shift as if the world held its breath" uses a slightly soft filter verb ("felt") at a key moment, slightly dulling the immediacy of this pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, this density borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats, with a high frequency of figurative language that occasionally muddles sense (e.g., "constellations of memory upon the glass"). A minor paraphrase loop exists with "fragmented radio frequencies," though it serves the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is highly polished with varied rhythm and sentence openings. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("billowing like a sigh," "dust motes to dance like tiny planets"). Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose has high density and rhythmic control ("low, sustained chord filled the marina"). Minor strain in "fleshly ethereal glow" slightly muddles coherence, but peak beats remain clear. No loops or scaffolds; sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A minor deduction is applied for a tendency toward dense figurative language in a few high-pressure beats, which creates a slight risk of opacity, though it does not break clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm is varied and supports the atmospheric tension. A minor deduction for a subtle instance of thesaurus-churn: "reverberate" is used three times, and "entangled memories" appears twice, creating a slight template cadence that is noticeable but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A minor instance of repetitive phrasing ("vibrant and hushed" appears twice) slightly dulls the closure image but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly dense and inventive, with strong rhythmic control. However, it skirts overwriting; clusters of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("yearning algorithm—a self‑editing code of longing") approach decorative density, applying a slight deduction. The closure image remains clear and potent, saving the score from a steeper drop.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and generally propulsive. A minor artifact exists: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like distant choir," "like phantom breadcrumb") creates a mild pattern that, while beautiful, slightly softens the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is highly dense and often beautiful, but this density creates minor momentum drag in high-pressure beats, such as the description of the mirror visions. While generally purposeful, the figurative language occasionally borders on overstacked (e.g., "scattering it into a thousand specks" following "amber flare"). The sentence-level rhythm is otherwise strong and varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor tendency toward dense figurative language in peak beats ("like pages turning in a book") slightly risks obscuring immediacy but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly poetic and dense, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; the density of figurative language in some sentences ("liquid memory," "passionate subtlety") creates a slight drag on momentum. A few phrases, like "nurture intersubjective understanding," feel tonally jarring against the more embodied narration, but clarity is never broken.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a slight figurative density in phrases like "whisperfield calm" and "seed of insight" creates minor artifacts that, while purposeful, occasionally verge on decorative in an otherwise precise narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is highly polished and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, minor overwriting is present, including a cliché ("swirled like whispered secrets") and some stacked modifiers ("subtle puzzle archivist") that slightly dilute immediacy. These are minor artifacts that do not significantly harm closure or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, but density approaches overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "fractured sequences that fractured time"). A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "suspended hush." However, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closure image remains potent and undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats, such as "the gentle crackle of memories slipping through the reeds of time," which slightly blurs sense. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. There is no scaffold or looped phrasing. A minor deduction for a potential register drift in the peak beat: "a reminder that some forces endure" leans slightly declarative, but it is immediately grounded again in the concrete image of the pulsing stars, preventing significant clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor prose artifact exists: a template cadence runs through sentences describing the vinyl ("its jagged edge catching light...", "letting the faint crackle...") which, while purposeful, creates a slight repetitive stem. This does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong information density. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("quietly deliberate," "quiet dawn") and a template cadence in "She whispered... Each syllable a loop..." However, these do not obscure closure, and the final image remains potent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in "Each click of vertebrae resonated..." and a slight register drift in the climax ("embryonic galaxy"), but these do not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences describing reflection ("reflectively vibrant yet hushed") but does not obscure closure, warranting a small deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts exist: the phrase "protected vulnerability" is a label, and "honeyed hush" repeats, creating a template cadence. However, these do not obscure closure, and information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, but slight overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("pulse like a held breath," "swirling hush"). This creates minor figurative muddle in early beats, though clarity is maintained at the crucial closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "notes rose like sunbeams") and a hint of synonym churn ("gathering hush," "luminous instant"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact penalty is applied for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some peak beats, creating occasional density that can momentarily slow momentum (e.g., "each a tiny lighthouse guiding the unseen cartographer"). No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("tide of whispers") but clarity maintained. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and highly deliberate, with strong rhythmic control. However, it flirts with overwriting; the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("whalebone reverie of soft, lingering light") creates a slight drag on momentum and clarity. While beautiful, the prose occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density. Minor figurative overload in a few lines (e.g., "rain beads... like tiny metronomes") slightly dulls momentum, but clarity is maintained. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with figurative language that consistently advances character and atmosphere. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats but does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, varying rhythm to match emotional intensity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and good rhythm. However, minor artifacts are present, including some synonym churn ("resurrected hope," "renewed purpose") and a tendency toward compound abstractions ("ethicial currents of reclaimed technology") that slightly dull immediacy at peak beats. The closure image remains clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lush and controlled, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. However, a distinct text artifact exists: the paragraph beginning "He recalled the night..." is repeated almost verbatim. This is a significant paraphrase loop that dulls momentum and constitutes a template cadence issue, warranting a deduction despite the overall high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop ("serene upheaval" is used twice) and a moment of register drift in a high-pressure beat that slightly obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush and highly polished, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting, such as in the slightly mixed metaphor of the rope coiling "like a sleeping serpent" after its secrets are "safe." This creates a minor artifact that slightly dulls the clarity of the closure image, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly evocative, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor risk of overwriting exists in phrases like "the sigh of rustling leaves," and a near-paraphrase loop occurs between "geography of healing" and "map of connections," slightly dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Exceptionally high information density and rhythmic control, though occasional dense metaphors ("a world more gear than garden") slightly slow momentum. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. The prose is precise and propulsive, serving the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, a tendency toward overwriting and occasional register drift ("kelp-drift peace," "narrated stories of fire and water") creates minor artifacts that slightly dull the immediacy of peak beats, though they do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and vivid with high information density ("refracting it into kaleidoscopic prayers"). Minor scaffold in adjacent sentences ("The box shivered... and the glass began to stick") causes a slight rhythm dip but doesn't obscure closure. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats, creating a density that slightly obscures clarity and momentum. A minor paraphrase loop exists ("sonar pinging" is repeated frequently). The final image remains clear and potent despite this.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences often serving multiple functions (e.g., "a paradox that suited the place"). Minor artifact penalties (-0.3) for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some high-pressure beats (e.g., "mind was a fiercely meditative river"), creating occasional mild opacity, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is often lush and evocative, but suffers from minor overwriting and density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a searing reverie that painted the horizon with fire"). This creates a slight momentum drag and figurative muddle, though clarity is never fully obscured and the closure lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation and information density. A minor deduction for a potential paraphrase loop in describing the case's compartments ("tenderly organized" / "rhythm of his careful hands") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats, though it remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent information density. A minor deduction for occasional dense, figurative phrasing in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the air shimmered with a chill that sang of hidden possibilities") that, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring immediate clarity. However, no loops, scaffold, or muddle harm the crucial closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a few clusters (e.g., "flames trembling like thistles in a breeze" following "thistled calm") which creates a momentary pattern that feels slightly decorative rather than driven. However, this does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, but risks overwriting in peak beats with stacked metaphors ("kaleidoscope that painted the walls with muted rainbows"). While often beautiful, this density occasionally slightly obscures immediacy and momentum. The rhythm is purposeful and there are no loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A single metaphorical overreach ("abrasive calm") slightly muddles clarity in a peak beat, but it is an isolated flaw in otherwise exemplary line-level craft that propels the story forward.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with high information density. Minor figurative over-density appears in phrases like "threading golden threads through a tapestry of silence," creating a slight rhythmic stumble, but it does not obscure causality or closure. Overall, the line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potential overwriting occurs with "synaptic plasticity, the brain’s quiet gardener," which feels slightly explanatory. However, this is a isolated moment in an otherwise flawlessly executed sequence where every sentence advances story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero scaffold or loop artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and legible ("sky's hidden fireworks," "electric nectar"). Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, varying rhythm to match the contemplative and revelatory beats. The final line is a strong, resonant image that recharges the opening motifs without summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety and information density. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight filter-verb stack ("seemed to shift, pausing as if listening") and a hint of register drift in "inadvertently profound." However, these do not obscure closure, and the final image is crystal clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is highly skilled with strong rhythm and vivid imagery, though it occasionally trends toward overwriting with dense figurative language ("cascading revelations unfurled like tides"). A few near-paraphrase loops exist ("cascading revelations" appears multiple times), but they do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose exhibits exceptional density and rhythm, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and theme. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift; even high-pressure beats maintain clarity and propulsion toward the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and vivid, purposeful imagery. There is a very high information density, with most sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor deduction for slight density in the final paragraphs, where the lyrical descriptions ("visual lexicon of remembrance") momentarily verge on abstraction, though they remain legible and do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally high, with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythmic control. However, a minor deduction for occasional moments of elevated diction that slightly clash with the POV's lexicon in high-pressure beats (e.g., "exhale colors," "pulsed anew"). The prose is largely free of loops, scaffolds, and figurative muddle, maintaining strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and vivid with excellent rhythmic control, though it occasionally leans into repetitive stems ("latent radiance" appears three times). Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A few mixed metaphors ("like a dying star") slightly muddle clarity but do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic variation. However, it frequently crosses into overwriting; figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("exhaling a repulsive allure," "viscous syrup," "screaming silhouettes") without a taught pattern, creating a density that occasionally obscures clarity and momentum, particularly in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and highly evocative, with excellent information density. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; a cluster of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a cascade of silver threads destined to dissolve into silence") creates a slight muddle, applying a patterned-artifact penalty that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously ("sun washed the city in amber dread"). Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on compound descriptors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though minor artifacts appear: "pulsed with forgotten journeys" is a slightly mixed metaphor, and the climax has a summary-leaning cadence. No loops or scaffolding; closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and information density. However, minor overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats, such as "veil of mist over the pavilion, turning the air into a hushed blaze of damp copper," where the metaphor slightly muddles sense. A single instance of a template cadence ("She [verb]ed...") appears but does not form a run. No loops or scaffolding; sentence-level propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the scent of old parchment rose like a mournful sigh" conveys setting, mood, and character perception). A minor deduction for a slight pattern of "reclaimed stillness" and "dappled resolve" repetition, though it is thematically motivated. The closure beat remains clear and un-obscured by any figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation. Minor deduction for a potential density issue; the consistent high level of figurative language, while beautiful, occasionally flirts with overwhelming the core action in a few lines, though it never fully obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Minor artifact: "intangibly tangible" is repeated, but this is a taught pattern that pays off and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats, which occasionally risks abstraction (e.g., "frequency of belonging that bound all wanderers to the stars"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. There is a slight tendency toward density and ornate phrasing in a few spots (e.g., "a chorus of old testimonies that the sea refused to remember") that creates minor momentum drag, preventing a higher score, but clarity and propulsion are largely maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("a silent metronome," "a tiny compass") and the triple use of "furrowed hush," which creates a mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a cluster of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like a pen across paper," "drafting a narrative") creates slight density and a minor coherence issue, trending toward overwriting. This artifact is confined and does not obscure closure, but it prevents a higher score. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and information-dense.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, efficient imagery ("cathedral of algae," "dirty ledger of betrayals"). Information density is excellent, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing exists ("The journey was far from over, but for the first time..."), creating a slight momentum dip in the powerful final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly lyrical with strong rhythm and information density. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("air curled like a filament of starlight") slightly obscures immediacy but does not harm closure clarity. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, this density occasionally tips into overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a choking beauty that wrapped the soul in velvet"), creating a minor figurative muddle that slightly obscures immediacy without breaking closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and poetic precision. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("scattering photons like mournful fireflies"). Rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating toward the climax. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles to obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm, though it occasionally drifts into ornate phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy (e.g., "cascade of tiny sparks"). A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "whispering hush" and "vibrant hush," but it does not obscure closure. The final paragraph maintains clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished and evocative, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, a pattern of stacked modifiers and slightly ornate phrasing ("soft, expectant hush," "phosphorescent moss on damp stone") creates a mild density that, while beautiful, occasionally slows momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and propulsion, with high information density. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and varies with scene needs, from the calm opening to the pulsing climax. No significant loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor synonym churn ("cartography of scars" / "map of the scars") appears but does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a slight tendency toward abstraction ("destination of shared insight") and a few stacked metaphors ("constellations on a midnight map") create minor density in high-pressure beats, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly textured, with excellent rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward dense metaphor clusters ("a trembling candle against night," "whispered applause") creates minor momentum drag in early paragraphs, slightly working against the accumulative drive. The line-level craft is otherwise exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is strong and purposeful. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor figurative clutter appears in high-pressure beats ("leaves shimmering like silver rain," "taste of steel and longing"), causing a slight coherence deduction. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion, with figurative language serving pattern and payoff ("lanterns that hummed," "shadows that resembled ancient glyphs"). Minor rhythm issues in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a luminous doubt settle over her—a bright uncertainty") slightly obscure causality but do not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic but occasionally dense, with minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats that slightly obscures immediacy ("the color of unspoken apologies that lived only in the space between heartbeats"). Otherwise, craftsmanship is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line work is rich yet largely precise; images often do two jobs (world + theme). Minor redundancies (“permanent address,” “chased stillness”) recur but function as motif rather than dead weight. Figurative density runs high, flirting with purple, yet syntax remains clear and momentum steady. No loops or mechanical scaffolding slow the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with strong images and economical beats; the bell, arbor, and lanterns do multi‑work. There is mild redundancy and occasional adjective stacking; a few near‑loops and tautological constructs slightly slow momentum. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean. The final line lands by image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences carry high information density with varied rhythm; many lines do double duty (worldbuilding and action). Some metaphor stacking (“fog curling like a sentient blanket,” “exhale turned violet,” “river of sparks”) approaches excess but does not blur sense. Minimal scaffolding; momentum is mostly maintained. Minor redundancy around breath motifs keeps this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are lush and purposeful, with high image density supporting the accumulative mode. However, occasional overwriting and a noticeable error (“only by disintegrate the static walls”) nick polish, and a few near-synonymous intensifiers could be tightened. Rhythm mostly propels, especially around the child and the dusk closure. Clarity holds despite lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and image‑rich, with solid syntactic variety and momentum. Some metaphor stacking (“rusted cathedral,” “forgotten throat,” “sleeping hearts”) edges toward excess, and a few near‑duplicates slow pace. Clarity remains high and the final image is clean. Minor trims could heighten pressure and cut flourish overlap.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush and image‑dense, with strong noun‑verb choices and recurrent motifs doing double duty. Some repetition (“absences,” aurora/forge imagery) borders on redundancy but largely serves cadence. A few purple edges and stacked modifiers slightly slow momentum in the middle. Overall clarity and propulsion hold, with a clean final image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prosody is musical with strong image density, but stacked metaphors and glow‑words recur (“luminous disbelief,” “liquid silver”) creating slight saturation and drag.

Momentum holds, but tighter pruning could heighten impact. Final beats remain clear despite the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line‑level craft is clean and musical; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with good concision. Figurative density is high but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors; repetition (“amalgamate”) is purposeful. Minor tendency toward purple/philosophical phrasing is present but doesn’t stall momentum. The final image is crisp and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line craft is polished and image‑dense, with varied syntax and purposeful repetition. A few abstractions recur (“ambiguously clear”) and risk mild redundancy, but they are pattern‑taught and thematically aligned. No significant scaffold or confusion; momentum is maintained despite the lyric mode. Figurative logic remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush and mostly precise, with lines doing double duty (action and worldbuilding) and a steady rhythm. Metaphor density is high; while coherent, it occasionally risks saturation and small redundancy (“whispered,” “hummed,” “promised” patterns). Momentum doesn’t stall, but a lighter touch in a few sentences would sharpen pressure. Mechanics are clean and sequencing clear.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines are polished and image-rich, with good momentum for a lyric piece. Some redundancy and purple density (“magnetic nexus at twilight” and “icy warmth” recur with near-identical phrasing) soften impact and could be tightened. Syntax varies and proofreading is clean. The closure image remains clear despite ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is sensuous and mostly efficient; images carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, plot cues). Minor redundancy and adjective echo (“trembling” lanterns, reiterated water/light textures) create slight purple creep. Momentum holds; sentences vary and closure image is clear. A bit less overlay would sharpen pressure without losing music.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and purposeful imagery tied to action (smudges revealing humidity/pressure, needle tremors as notes of truth).

No major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with strong image economy and multi-function lines; sensory choices support momentum. Minor repetition (bronze, hum, axis) serves motif rather than filler but edges toward sameness. No figurative muddle or scaffold loops that harm clarity. Rhythm modulates well through the descent and activation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lines are largely clear and propulsive for a lyric mode, with good image economy (beam/spiral/ink/mist). Some overwriting and synonymic intensifiers recur, and a few sentences summarize rather than dramatize peak beats. Figurative density stays coherent, but costs and actions sometimes default to abstraction. Minimal scaffolding remains, yet momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are rhythmic and image‑dense with generally clean syntax; key beats are shown rather than summarized. Figurative language is heavy but mostly coherent; a few phrases loop (“decorated with silence,” “muffled clarity”) and one grammar slip (“intent on plumb”) distracts. Momentum survives the lushness, but purple edges slightly blur pressure. Information density remains strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are musical and image‑dense, with good momentum for a lyric mode. However, figurative saturation is near‑constant (horizon whispering, chords in cracks, batons of luminous sound), risking overrichness; some pruning would sharpen peaks. Clarity holds and scaffolding is minimal. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is musical and image-rich with good momentum, but it edges into overwriting with repeated motifs and stacked abstractions. Occasional synonym loops and intensifier pairs reduce freshness and precision. Despite this, clarity remains intact and key beats are legible. Cutting a few redundant phrases would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Imagery is vivid and largely coherent; sentences carry multiple jobs (world rule + emotion).

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lines are largely clean and musical, with strong noun-verb choices and sensory density. Some repetition (“cycles of compassion,” “cautious exuberance”) and abstract assertions edge toward purple or didactic. Momentum holds despite reflective passages. Final images are clear and un-muddled by figurative overload.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and largely effective, with strong image density (“black glass bark,” “ribbons of violet,” “luminescent ache”). At times it edges toward purple or repetition, risking softness in momentum. Still, clarity holds and sentences often carry dual duties of worldbuilding and thematic charge. Minor pruning could heighten propulsion without losing music.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lush prose mostly earns its keep; images often do double duty (world + concept). Some repetition (“interrupted cadence,” “borrow time,” “uncage”) risks echoing, but reads as purposeful motif. Minimal scaffold and strong sentence variety keep momentum. A few near‑purple flourishes slightly blur pressure but not the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line‑level craft is lush and mostly clear, with strong image economy across recurring motifs. Some metaphor density and near‑repetitions create mild purple drift and lessen propulsion in the middle. Syntax varies, and transitions are clean. The final paragraphs deliver a crisp cadence without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with strong image selection and clean syntax; momentum holds. There’s mild purple saturation and motif echo that risk redundancy but rarely blur sense. Sentences often do double duty (atmosphere + action). Sharpening a few abstractions would lift density further.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line‑level work is polished and rhythmic, with purposeful images (droplets as prisms, veins as rivers). There is some density stacking and repetition (“reluctant metamorphosis,” “circuitously sincere”) that risks overstatement. Syntax varies and momentum holds, avoiding scaffold loops. Figurative choices remain coherent to the botanic/meteorological palette.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lines are clean, image‑dense, and mostly economical; many sentences carry multiple jobs. Occasional purple accents (“perpetually bruised sky,” “single, trembling note of hope”) verge on lush but don’t blur sense. Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops; momentum holds. The prose supports pressure without over‑ornamenting the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lines are musical with strong image economy, but recurring phrases (“bright darkness,” “unseen forces,” “overlapping shadows”) verge on looped scaffolding. Occasional purple flourishes flatten pressure by repeating effects rather than deepening them. Rhythm remains readable, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. The final third repeats motifs without new torque.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line‑level craft is polished: images carry multiple jobs, cadence varies, and figurative language remains coherent. A few near‑reiterations (e.g., fragment/echo motifs) risk mild redundancy but mostly build pattern. Momentum holds despite lyric density. No artifacts that blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)

Overall clarity holds, with only light excess density.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful, with strong verbs and high information density. Occasional intensifier stacking (“prismatic echoes,” “hushed thunder,” “spatial mutiny”) edges toward purple without obscuring sense. No significant loop or scaffold; rhythm varies and carries momentum. The final cadence cleanly recharges established motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished, with vivid metaphors (“midnight river,” “veins of gold”) and efficient momentum. A few phrases flirt with purple or redundancy (“waited actively”), but clarity remains intact and images do double duty. Syntax varies and the final line lands cleanly. No major loops or scaffold drag the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line work is musical and image‑dense without collapsing into muddle; multiple sentences carry double duty (world + theme). Minor repetition (“refract”/“hum”) brushes redundancy but functions as motif, not loop. No significant figurative clashes or cadence templates; momentum holds through variation in sentence length. Slight purple tint in places, yet clarity persists.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful images (“museum of vanished moments,” “ghostly murals”). A touch of repetition (“collect fragments of overheard stories”) and motif reiteration edges toward redundancy, but rarely stalls momentum. Figurative language remains coherent and scene-tethered. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is lush and mostly precise (“needle trembling like a laugh caught in a storm”). Occasional purple density and small loops mildly slow momentum, and the thesis sentence flattens lyric charge. Syntax varies and carries motion; most lines do multiple jobs. Copy is clean and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly economical, with strong images (“kaleidoscope of music,” “living map”). Some summarizing passages flatten momentum, and a few phrases recur, creating mild echo. Figurative density stays coherent; no muddled metaphors. Line rhythm is varied enough to carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line‑level craft is polished with precise verbs and layered sentences; the chemical mechanic is lucid. Minor repetition (“dawning hush”) and occasional purple edging slightly flatten momentum. Still, information density is high and images do multiple jobs. The final cadence is clean and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are polished, sensory-rich, and mostly purposeful; repetition motifs (mist, light) feel intentional rather than looped. A few phrases verge on purple or redundantly intensify (“magnetic calm” twice), but momentum holds. Syntax varies and images carry multiple jobs (function, mood, theme). Copy is clean with clear sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong line‑level control with purposeful syntax variety; images do multiple jobs (map/veins/condensation). Minimal scaffolding and few redundancies; rhythm suits the scene’s slow tightening. Some metaphor stacking edges toward ornament in mid‑story (“cracked spine cracking like a tiny gun,” “world tilt”), but clarity holds. The final line resolves cleanly by image and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lines are polished with strong sound play and layered imagery; many sentences do double duty (world + theme). There is mild purple drift and motif repetition (“wild hush,” “balance”) that edges toward redundancy. Syntax varies but favors long, undulating periods that can blur edge contrast at peaks. Overall propulsion holds, but density occasionally softens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft offers strong images and purposeful repetition, but purple density and minor grammatical slips reduce clarity. Key terms loop (“gathered hush,” “unsnarl”) beyond pattern into redundancy. Occasional syntactic bumps and paraphrase-like reiterations slow momentum in high-pressure beats. The prose is often lovely but needs cutting and precision to meet elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lush lines often do double duty, yet purple density and a paraphrase loop undercut precision (“through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades” repeats awkwardly). Occasional mixed logic images (“boots slipping through the scuffs”) blur action. Redundant intensifiers appear in the final third, dulling edge. Still, many sentences carry clean sensory charge.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with purposeful metaphor; lines often do double duty (world & theme). Minor redundancy (e.g., repeated “mournful elation,” “resonant awakenings”) and an occasional stacked modifier signal slight overwriting. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and the closure image is crisp. Mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are polished with high image density and varied rhythm, yet the figurative load occasionally doubles back (“after the tide pools empty… still empty”) and leans toward redundancy.

    Lines carry weight with purposeful imagery and few fillers; verbs do work. Occasional redundancy (“curiously steadfast” twice; “comforting unease” motif) nudges toward echo but doesn’t stall momentum. Figurative density stays mostly controlled, and action order is clear. The closing image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lines are musical and dense, with purposeful imagery; most sentences carry more than one job. Some repetition and ornamentation flirt with purple (multiple glow and hum variants, layered binaries), modestly slowing momentum. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands cleanly. Minor trims could heighten propulsion without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and musical, with strong image economy in key beats (mirror/teeth alignment, the vial’s pulse). However, stacked modifiers and repeated phrases (“auroral sorrow” recur) flirt with purple excess. Momentum largely holds, but pruning near‑duplicates would sharpen impact. Syntax varies, and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line‑level work is vivid and economical for the mode, with strong nouns and purposeful metaphor (“ink shimmered like sunrise on metal”; “greenhouse walls close like lungs”).

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line‑level craft is often beautiful, but motifs recur with near‑identical phrasing (“glisten,” “seasonally mute,” “symphonies of truth”) creating paraphrase loops. Some purple pressure accumulates in stacked abstractions that echo rather than advance image or action. Sentences generally scan cleanly, with few mechanical errors. The closure beat works, but repetition mutes its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and largely efficient; images often do double duty (technical calibration and lyric shimmer). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. Occasional intensifiers and stacked metaphors lightly crowd peak beats, but momentum holds. Closing cadence is well‑tuned.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean sentences with lush imagery, but repetition and near-synonym loops soften momentum (“sandstorm calm” and prompt-like refrains recur). Figurative load is steady and sometimes redundant, edging toward overwrought in places. Information density is decent, yet some lines paraphrase what the prior sentence already implied. The final image remains clear despite these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, clean syntax, and purposeful imagery. A few repetitions (“calm defiance,” spider/web time) flirt with purple but don’t obscure sense. Momentum generally advances without scaffolding or loops. Final images are sharp and earned.

Some metaphor density and phrase recurrence (“winking hush,” “calmly inventive”) verge on purple and mildly slow momentum. Clarity is maintained, and most lines do multiple jobs. Trimming a few redundancies would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line‑level craft is strong: varied syntax, purposeful figurative language, and high information density. A few motifs recur (“borrowed dawn,” “lingering promise”), flirting with over‑insistence but staying controlled. Clarity holds in peak beats (the hum, ignition, tide pause). Occasional purple edges don’t impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines are polished with strong image economy, and most sentences do multiple jobs (atmosphere, action, theme). The prose risks purple but stays coherent; occasional intensifiers and repeated turns (“furiously tranquil,” “cartography of scars”) skirt redundancy without tipping into loops. Syntax varies and momentum is maintained through the countdown. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally tight and musical with clean mechanics and purposeful images. Some redundancy (“turn questions into destinations,” “hidden overture”) and near‑duplicate constructions create light loopiness. Figurative density stays coherent, though a few metaphors are reiterated rather than evolved. Momentum is maintained, especially through the duel to the alignment beat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines are lush yet mostly disciplined; images (“whispered applause,” “veins of light”) are vivid and coherent. Some motif repetition (“luminous fracture,” moon’s passage) edges toward overinsistence but doesn’t muddle sense or stall momentum. Syntax varies and carries the lyric cadence without template drumbeats. Clean mechanics and high information density for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly economical; motifs recur with intent rather than churn. A few stacked metaphors flirt with excess, but clarity and momentum persist, especially around the night threshold and encore. Sentence and paragraph rhythm vary well; the final image is clean and charged. Minimal redundancy; “steely longing” reprises purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is controlled and image‑rich, with high information density and few redundancies. A handful of metaphor stacks flirt with purple, but vehicles stay coherent and purposeful (“silvered pages turning in a wind of thought”). Momentum is preserved through action‑tied description; syntax varies naturally. No noticeable scaffold loops or line‑level artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line‑level craft is polished with strong images and varied sentences, but density approaches purple in places (“lace‑like clouds,” “rhythmically placid” recur). Minimal scaffolding and good propulsion for a quiet piece. Some metaphor redundancy and adjective stacking slightly dulls impact in the final third. Clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often elegant and precise, with strong imagery like the greenhouse as a "wounded beast." However, there are minor instances of overwriting where figurative language feels dense rather than propulsive, and some conceptual phrases are looped ("preprocess reality, nudging the world"). These moments slightly dull the momentum but do not obscure the story's causal path or the clarity of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often evocative, but it suffers from several prose artifacts. There are conceptual loops where the same idea about "purpose in pauses" is rephrased in close proximity. The line "her mind steady and steadily adaptive" is a clear redundancy. These tics, along with a high density of figurative language, occasionally stall momentum and reduce the clarity and impact of key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting. The density of figurative language is consistently high, which can feel strenuous. More critically, the repetitive use of the phrase "unshaken marvels" functions as a conceptual loop, hammering a theme instead of allowing it to resonate, which dulls the final beats slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from several instances of conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. Key thematic ideas like "permanent address" and "occupying impossible spaces" are repeated in slightly different phrasing, and the prose occasionally becomes dense with figurative language that slows momentum rather than sharpens it. This repetition slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong imagery like the bell's tone traveling "like a secret heartbeat." This strength is diluted by a reliance on abstract conceptual language ("a test of solidarity," "a chain of care") and minor redundancies ("amplified quiet that seemed to amplify") that slightly dull the narrative's momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with a high density of figurative language that contributes to the story's lush atmosphere. However, this density occasionally verges on overwriting, with nearly every sentence carrying a simile or metaphor, which can slow momentum in peak moments. While there are no major grammatical errors or artifacts, a more varied sentence structure and a lighter touch with the poetic flourishes would elevate the craft further.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless figurative density verges on being overwritten, slightly dulling the momentum. Nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile, which at times feels more decorative than propulsive. A minor but distracting grammatical error ("by disintegrate the static walls") interrupts the flow. Despite these issues, the word choice is precise and the sentence structure varied, creating a powerful, rhythmic effect that successfully builds the story's reverie-like atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains striking imagery, especially in the opening, and demonstrates a strong command of sentence-level rhythm. However, it frequently slips into overwriting, with dense figurative language and declarative statements that tell rather than show ("as if the very air honored her patient, strategic resolve"). This tendency towards ornate summary slightly dulls the story's momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there is a minor tendency toward conceptual looping, with words like "void," "absence," and "memory" recurring in slightly different phrasing across adjacent sentences. This creates a slight drag on momentum without significantly obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but overwritten, with nearly every sentence laden with a simile or metaphor. This density creates a monotonous rhythm and dulls the impact of individual images ("humming like distant heartbeats," "moved like liquid dusk," "eyes like polished onyx"). While often beautiful in isolation, the relentless stacking of figurative language becomes a stylistic artifact that impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, but it suffers from occasional overwriting and conceptual redundancy. The phrase "weighty lightness" is repeated three times, functioning as a scaffold that tells the reader the intended feeling rather than letting the scene create it. While individual sentences are strong, this repetition and a tendency toward dense figurative language slightly dulls the story's momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that occasionally blurs clarity. There are several instances of telling over showing at key moments, such as summarizing the climactic choice with "I seized the moment to prove that vulnerability is power." The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops, restating the central theme multiple times, which dulls the impact of the closing image and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    While many individual sentences are beautifully crafted, the prose is hampered by significant text artifacts that would require editorial intervention. A clear paraphrase loop occurs in the opening paragraph ("charting the darkness... His purpose was clear: to draw a map..."). Furthermore, the repetitive use of key phrases ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") becomes a stylistic crutch that dulls their impact through overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and often evocative, with strong rhythm and clarity. The primary weakness is a handful of moments where abstract concepts are packaged in dense, explanatory phrases ("subroutine that mirrored the way neurons fire," "amalgamate the physical reverberations...with the intangible patterns"). These moments read more like technical summaries than lived experience, slightly slowing the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and repetition that dulls its impact. Key phrases like "resonant hush" and "ambiguously clear" are used so frequently they become crutches rather than motifs. There is a high density of figurative language throughout, which can feel effortful, and several sentences are conceptually dense but rhythmically awkward ("a chorus of murmurs that felt like words after words become unnecessary").

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is rich and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, its greatest strength is also a minor weakness: the figurative density is so high that it sometimes verges on overwriting. More critically, there are moments of authorial intrusion where the prose explains the significance of an action, such as "The act was not mere cleaning but a ritual," which slightly dulls the immediacy and trusts the reader a little less than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often beautiful but is marred by artifacts in the final third that dull its impact. Lines that explain character feeling ("her obliging nature satisfied...") or summarize the theme ("The experiment proved that...") function as scaffolding that a flawless piece would omit, slightly weakening an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and contains beautiful imagery, but it is overwrought. Figurative language is so dense that metaphors and similes begin to lose their impact, and certain phrases like "wordless conversation" are repeated, dulling their effect. The opening sentence's "trembling lanterns... their amber light trembling" is a small example of the synonym churn that needs tightening for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.0)
    While often beautiful, the prose is hampered by overwriting and repetition. Key phrases ("auroral sorrow," "swaying certainties," "occupying margins") are repeated in a short space, reading like thematic signposts rather than organic language. The density of figurative language in nearly every sentence is stylistically bold but occasionally blunts momentum, and an early paraphrase loop slightly weakens the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    While ambitious, the prose is severely hampered by pervasive paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy. Key ideas—the "swallowed truth," the "ghost shift," the "weight"—are restated repeatedly with slight variations, creating synonym churn that stalls momentum. This textual artifact is not stylistic but reads as a lack of confidence in the initial phrasing, ultimately dulling the impact of an otherwise evocative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lush but frequently tips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can blunt momentum. There are minor instances of repetitive phrasing, particularly the repeated use of "regenerative silence" as a label. The moment of climax is described in two adjacent beats that paraphrase the same effect, slightly weakening the impact of the arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose contains moments of beauty, but it is marred by repetitive phrasing that functions as a scaffold. Key descriptors like "ordinary magic," "cautious exuberance," and "softly adaptive" are recycled, creating noticeable loops that dull the narrative's texture. While grammatically clean, these text artifacts reduce the prose's momentum and information density, particularly on a second read.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, but it is marred by a conspicuous prose artifact. The phrase "bronze quiet" is repeated three times in near-identical constructions, creating a template cadence that feels authorial rather than organic. This stylistic tic, while thematically relevant, disrupts the otherwise strong line-level craft and dulls the momentum in the latter half of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, but it occasionally slips into overwriting, with an overabundance of figurative language and abstract nouns. A phrase like "its rocky heart beating in time with the newly forged key of humanity" feels overwrought and less effective than the story's more concrete images. This density sometimes muddles the line-level momentum, particularly near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, which blunts the impact of key moments and reduces momentum. The story also contains paraphrase loops where the function of the priest's words is restated multiple times ("Each phrase was a mirror," "His words...cut through," "Every phrase was a lever"), an artifact that should be excised.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless density of figurative language borders on overwriting, with metaphors occasionally crowding each other. A minor paraphrase loop ("the horizon... the horizon... mirrored horizon") slightly impedes momentum early on. While stylistically bold, a more judicious use of imagery would allow the strongest moments to resonate more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness, suffering from severe overwriting. It is choked with dense, often vague figurative language ("darkening brightness," "periodically eternal") and repetitive loops that stall momentum. This density obscures rather than clarifies, prioritizing impressive-sounding phrases over narrative propulsion and emotional authenticity, ultimately reading as purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless density of figurative language verges on overwriting. Nearly every sentence carries a metaphor ("throat of stone," "filament of hush," "ribbons of light," "taut rope of feeling"), which can overwhelm the action and dull momentum. This stylistic choice, while consistent, creates a texture so thick that it sometimes obscures the simple, powerful emotional beats underneath.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean but burdened by recurring abstract phrases and a significant paraphrase loop. The phrase "layered tranquility" appears three times in quick succession, dulling its impact and revealing a lack of lexical variety under pressure. While many images are evocative, this repetition and a tendency toward ornate but vague descriptors ("humming with unseen expectation") create momentum drag and prevent the line-level craft from achieving true sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates high information density, with many lines serving multiple functions. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally verges on overwriting, creating a uniform texture that could benefit from moments of starker simplicity to heighten contrast. The sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, and the piece is free of glaring mechanical flaws or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting. Figurative language is so dense that it occasionally blurs meaning, and paraphrase-loops appear frequently, restating a concept in adjacent sentences with different metaphors. This density, while contributing to atmosphere, slows momentum and creates conceptual redundancy that a more concise execution would avoid.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels overwritten. In several passages, metaphors are stacked in a way that slightly impedes momentum ("Her voice...traveled...finding the violinist's ear like a tide seeking a hidden shore"). While evocative, this density borders on excessive, slightly dulling the clarity and propulsion of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and sensory-rich, with strong verbs and a varied sentence rhythm. The line-level craft is generally very high. The main weakness is a subtle conceptual redundancy, where core ideas like "fusing insight with empathy" are restated with slightly different phrasing at different points, creating minor paraphrase loops that slightly slow the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, particularly in its descriptive passages. However, it is weakened by a tendency towards abstraction and sentimentality, especially in the latter half. The final paragraphs suffer from thematic summary that dulls the impact of the concrete imagery, functioning as a prose artifact that tells the reader what to feel rather than letting the scene do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is ambitious and often beautiful, its high density of figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting, especially in the opening. Phrases like "a personal ache of light" risk losing their impact in a sea of similar metaphors, slightly dulling momentum. While the rhythm is strong, a greater degree of concision and restraint in key moments would allow the most powerful images to land with more force.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    While technically clean, the prose suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that approaches overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, which can dull the impact of individual images and bog down momentum. A more judicious use of ornament, especially in moments of high action, would allow the story's strongest images to resonate more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is lush but suffers from significant overwriting. Nearly every sentence is laden with figurative language ("cracked like old parchment," "lingered like a half‑remembered song," "blooming like a night flower"), which weighs down the momentum and dulls the impact of individual images. There are also instances of paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy, particularly around "mathematics of emotion" and "buried optimism." This lack of concision and rhythmic variety prevents the line-level craft from achieving the clarity and propulsion required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains moments of genuine beauty and precision, but is marred by recurring artifacts. The phrase "sapphire hush" is repeated four times, diminishing its initial impact and becoming a noticeable loop. There is a tendency towards dense, stacked figurative language that verges on overwriting, and several sentences serve as scaffolding, stating what the reader can already infer (e.g., "...a reminder of urgency"). These issues detract from the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong sensory details. However, momentum is hampered by prose artifacts, specifically the thematic and descriptive loops around phrases like "circuitously sincere," "reluctant metamorphosis," and "releasing control." This repetition, while thematically relevant, creates redundancy and slightly dulls the story's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is frequently evocative and demonstrates a strong ear for rhythm. However, it is hampered by occasional conceptual loops and moments of abstraction that stall momentum. Phrases like "thresh meaning" and "grind the raw grief" are repeated conceptually, and sentences like "conduits of memory, an exchange of the island’s past for her present vision" are overwrought explanations that dilute the power of the climax they follow.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a reliance on declarative sentences that tell rather than show pivotal moments ("The cave pearl responds..."). There is a notable repetition of key thematic phrases ("unseen forces," "bright darkness") that, while creating an incantatory rhythm, borders on synonym churn. The high density of figurative language throughout tends to blur together, sometimes softening the impact of key beats rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there is a slight tendency toward overwriting through an over-density of similes ("like shattered glass," "like fireflies," "like a librarian," "like a sponge," "like a patient muse," "like a compass"). While individually effective, their frequency in a short piece slightly dulls their impact and creates a prose artifact. The phrase "reactively visionary" also stands out as a piece of abstract jargon in an otherwise poetic text.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and highly figurative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are minor prose artifacts that prevent a higher score. The phrase "trembling certainty" is repeated, slightly dulling its impact. Additionally, a subtle template cadence ("She knelt... She inhaled... She placed...") emerges in the middle, briefly flattening the otherwise dynamic sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels overwrought, slowing momentum. There are also minor instances of conceptual looping, such as "sculpt space for reflection" immediately followed by "carve a quiet alcove." The line-level craft is strong, but a lack of concision slightly dulls the impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious, with high information density and a strong, consistent rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative. However, the very high density of figurative language ("cascade of prismatic echoes," "heart of misplaced destiny") occasionally verges on overwriting, creating a texture so rich that it momentarily risks obscuring the action beneath its own artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically precise, but it suffers from conceptual looping and abstraction. The core idea of rigidity versus fluidity is restated through multiple near-synonyms (rigid thinking, stubborn doubts, rigid ideologies, stone walls, hard edges, absurd rigidity), which dulls momentum. Some phrasing feels overwrought, favoring abstract nouns ("a living calculus of moral exchange") over concrete, sensory detail, which keeps the reader at an intellectual rather than visceral distance from the magical event.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, it is hampered by occasional overwriting and moments of redundancy that slow the momentum. A key example is the paraphrase loop in "Each line was a careful observation, a record of how the light refracted off moss and onto his page," where the second half restates the first without adding pressure, revealing a need for a final, tightening edit.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and striking figurative language. However, a few minor but noticeable prose artifacts prevent a top-tier score. There are two instances of conceptual loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea, such as the back-to-back sentences on "erased histories," which slightly dilute the momentum in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a density that borders on being overwritten, particularly with its reliance on abstract conceptual nouns ("ephemeral compass," "universal riddle," "epistemic compass"). There are minor syntactic awkwardnesses and a grammatical slip ("reimagines") that betray a need for a final polish. While propulsive, the rhythm is sometimes hampered by these dense, layered constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the prose is grammatically clean, it suffers critically from a reliance on telling over showing, with the entire middle section summarizing key plot events instead of dramatizing them. The writing is laden with abstract concepts ("relentless wonder," "anarchic joy") and occasionally overwrought metaphors ("hopeful desperation that rose like steam from the river"). This lack of concrete, in-scene action drains momentum and leaves the narrative feeling inert and expository.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful but is hampered by occasional artifacts that dull its impact. There are instances of paraphrase-looping, such as describing the "dawning hush" and then immediately the "silence," which are redundant. The density of figurative language, while often effective, can feel slightly overwrought in places, and some sentence structures follow a repetitive "He [verb]..." template, slightly slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density, with figurative language that is both beautiful and functional. The rhythm and syntax support the calm, methodical pacing of the scene. A minor deduction is warranted for the repetition of the phrase "magnetic calm," which reads as a slight scaffold rather than an intentional, evolving motif.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is evocative and precise, but it suffers from an over-density of figurative language, particularly similes ("like a forgotten compass," "like a tired ear," "like a tiny gun"). While individually effective, their frequency verges on overwriting and can slightly dull momentum. Additionally, a few grand pronouncements, such as "the world listened," feel unearned and momentarily break the otherwise grounded, specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it's marred by noticeable artifacts. The phrase "patient patience" is a glaring redundancy that would require immediate revision. Furthermore, the thematic vocabulary (rhythm, hum, resonance, cadence) is overused to the point of becoming a loop, slightly dulling the momentum through repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is evocative but burdened by overwriting and conceptual repetition. Phrases like "gathered hush," "crystal perfume vial," and "unsnarl" are used so frequently they lose impact and read like scaffold. There are also paraphrase loops, such as when the text describes the scent unsnarling panic, and then immediately explains that the vial's power is to "unsnarl thought," which dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is marred by significant text artifacts that disrupt momentum. Verbatim repetition of long phrases ("through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades") and key terms ("copperlight repose," "sustains impossibilities") reads as mechanical looping, not purposeful refrain. This, combined with an overly dense application of figurative language, demonstrates a lack of concision and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, with powerful, evocative lines like a "sigh that tasted of roses and rust." The rhythm and syntax support the dreamlike atmosphere without sacrificing clarity. While there are minor instances of near-repetition ("a fragment... a fragment"), the overall craft is very strong, propelling the narrative through rich, purposeful imagery and controlled sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from overwriting and repetition. Figurative language ("orchid solace," "distant tide") is deployed so frequently it loses impact and clutters the lines. There are also conceptual loops where the same idea—sewing the canyon, transforming ruin—is restated in similar terms, slowing momentum. The prose sacrifices clarity and propulsion for a density of poeticism that is not always effective.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is marred by significant repetition of key conceptual phrases ("interrupted journeys," "purposeful wandering," "cautious enchantment"). This creates a scaffold-like, template cadence that feels mechanical rather than resonant. While individual images are evocative, these loops dull momentum and give the writing a prompt-driven quality that detracts from its overall craft.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor ("flickered like distant memories," "whispered promises," "ink of time," "lullaby of pixelated seas"), and this relentless density can numb the reader's senses. While grammatically clean, the lack of variation in sentence structure and figurative density creates a sluggish momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is frequently stunning, with evocative imagery and a confident rhythm. However, there is a recurring tendency to explain its own metaphors (e.g., "threads crossing like conspiratorial lines on a map"), a form of authorial scaffolding that slightly diminishes the power of the images. While the language is beautiful, this habit of over-elucidation, combined with a uniformly high figurative density, prevents the prose from achieving flawless transparency and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, but it is marred by repetitive artifacts that dull its momentum. "Fierce tenderness" is used four times, becoming a declarative scaffold rather than an earned feeling. This repetition, combined with other minor loops, prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of concision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, bordering on abstraction. Some sentences tell rather than show ("a paradox that let her see..."). The repetition of the key phrase "lotus-hearted ache" slightly diminishes its impact at the very end, preventing a higher score for an otherwise strong line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is often elegant and features strong imagery ("photon-kissed pigment," "a smile had been unlatched"). However, it suffers from a tendency towards overwriting, with a high density of adjectives that can dull momentum. There are also moments of conceptual redundancy and scaffolding, such as stating the motivation directly after it has been shown, which lessens the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting; the relentless density of abstract figurative language ("invisible tides," "nested awakenings," "miniature auroras") obscures clarity and dulls momentum. There are also conceptual loops, with the central theme of certainty vs. curiosity and the idea of "awakening" being restated in similar terms. The piece lacks the concision and precision expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes muddles rather than clarifies ("candidly cryptic verses," "converging chaos into a single, luminous thread"). Abstract concepts like "warping perception" and "bending reality" are asserted repeatedly without sufficient concrete grounding. This density of metaphor and abstraction creates momentum drag in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains striking, memorable phrases but suffers from overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, leading to conceptual redundancy and a loss of momentum; ideas like pain blooming into beauty are rephrased multiple times. This density, while tonally consistent, approaches a "purple prose" quality that occasionally blurs meaning and would require significant trimming for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its imagery. However, there are minor but noticeable prose artifacts that prevent a higher score. A template cadence appears in constructions like "each petal catching..." and "each note a fragment...", and a paraphrase loop occurs with the repetition of "forgotten names" in the first paragraph. These slight mechanical patterns, while not severe, subtly undercut the otherwise organic flow of the language.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, the density of figurative language—ink that sings, glyphs that hum and whisper, script falling like droplets—borders on overwriting. While individually effective, the relentless stacking of metaphors and sensory details in nearly every sentence slightly dulls the impact of key moments through saturation, preventing an otherwise excellent piece from achieving flawless clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from pervasive overwriting, with nearly every sentence laden with figurative language, which ultimately dulls momentum and clarity. This high density of metaphor and simile ("boots...like muted drums," "links singing a low hymn," "tools...like insects") creates a cluttered texture. Additionally, conceptual phrases like "encrypted compassion" are looped, functioning as repetitive scaffolding rather than developing ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative with high information density. There are no significant artifacts. A minor deduction is for the repeated use of "bloom" which slightly diminishes the impact of its initial, more powerful usage in the phrase "withering grace."

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with evocative and original figurative language like “featherly determined” and “silent chords.” While mostly successful, this density occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly impeding momentum. A more significant flaw is the concluding paragraph’s shift into an abstract, declarative register, which clashes with the specific, sensory prose that defines the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is occasionally overwrought, with a density of figurative language that can blur clarity. Minor redundancies like "Aria moved softly, her steps softly ingenious" create small loops. More significantly, the shift to abstract, almost technical language in the final paragraph ("soft engine," "cosmos of belonging") is a jarring misstep that dulls the story's closing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often beautiful and evocative, it suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought. There is also a notable repetitive artifact: the phrase "cheerful gloom" is used four times, which dulls its impact and reads as a prose loop rather than an intentional, evolving motif. This repetition, especially its appearance in the story's final third, prevents the otherwise strong prose from achieving a flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting. A high density of abstract nouns ("orchestrated serendipity," "calculated wilderness") and figurative language in nearly every sentence bogs down the momentum. This conceptual saturation, while thematically consistent, makes the texture feel labored and less immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense with well-crafted figurative language, creating a potent atmosphere. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative with a quiet, steady momentum. While the overall effect is powerful, a few phrases ("swallow time itself") feel slightly more generic than the highly specific imagery that surrounds them, a minor inconsistency in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but severely hampered by overwriting and repetition. Conceptual loops are pervasive, with phrases like "read between lines" and concepts of "value" and "worth" being restated through synonym churn across multiple paragraphs. The relentless density of figurative language, while occasionally striking, often blurs into a uniform, overwrought texture that dulls momentum and feels more decorative than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains beautiful moments but is hampered by overwriting and repetition. The phrase "hard softness" is used twice, a conceptual crutch. Figurative language is so dense ("cascade of light fell like rain, each droplet a syllable of grief turned into hope") that it can obscure meaning. Several adjacent sentences restate the same idea in slightly different poetic terms, creating paraphrase loops that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its density sometimes works against it, verging on being overwritten. The final third of the story, in particular, suffers from a loss of momentum due to summary and conceptual loops. Phrases like "turning the entire coast into a living textbook of optimism" tell rather than show, and the final paragraph functions as an epilogue that paraphrases outcomes instead of landing on a single, sharp, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms. Momentum is generally well-maintained. The score is held back by minor but noticeable artifacts, such as the redundant use of "sensitively perceptive" and label-like phrases like "haunting motivation," which feel slightly generic and break the otherwise specific texture of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is rich but suffers from significant overwriting and repetitive phrasing. Key phrases ("borrowed heartbeat," "dusky harmony," "coded lullabies") are reused to the point of becoming incantatory but also losing their initial impact. This looping, combined with sentences that paraphrase the content of the previous one, creates a beautiful but static texture that slows momentum and feels like scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is marred by significant overwriting and repetition. Key abstract phrases ("ritual significance," "price of redemption," "flawed beauty," "operatively gentle") are looped throughout the text, functioning as scaffolding that dulls momentum. This synonym churn and template cadence give the piece a formulaic feel and obscure the emotional core under layers of ornate but imprecise language.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there's a slight tendency toward overwriting, where the density of figurative language occasionally feels more decorative than functional. Some phrases, like the direct explanation of his "fractured" motivations or the smile "the world would never read as compassion," lean more towards telling than showing, momentarily thinning the otherwise immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates strong command of rhythm. However, its relentless density of figurative language—with metaphors or similes in nearly every sentence—borders on overwriting. This uniformity of texture, while a deliberate choice, slightly dulls the narrative propulsion in key moments of action, trading momentum for ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, but suffers from overwriting in key moments. A high density of figurative language ("quiet comet," "meteor hush," "ribbons of starlight") sometimes clutters rather than clarifies. The repetitive use of "half-lit" becomes a noticeable prose artifact, and the final paragraph's shift into abstract, summary language dulls the sharpness of the preceding climax, creating momentum drag at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    While stylistically ambitious, the prose is hindered by significant overwriting. Figurative language is stacked so densely in almost every sentence ("blushing stillness," "rosy hush," "amber veil") that it begins to obscure concrete action and dulls its own impact. Lines like "a color that spoke louder than any spoken word" verge on abstraction, and the high density of ornate phrasing throughout creates a static, overwrought texture that impedes narrative momentum, which would require trimming for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is rich with vivid, specific imagery. However, it suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally borders on overwriting, and there are minor but clear prose artifacts. The repetition of phrases like "snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle" constitutes a loop, slightly dulling the momentum and precision of an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting and conceptual scaffolding. Figurative language is so dense it sometimes slows momentum, and the narrative frequently explains the meaning of its own imagery (e.g., explaining what the trail means immediately after describing it). The repetition of "precisely playful" feels like a prompt artifact rather than an organic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant text-artifact issues, primarily paraphrase loops and repetitive phrasing. The concept of "empirically ironic" is stated and then restated almost identically later on. Keywords are recycled to the point of becoming a distracting template cadence, which clogs momentum and reduces information density. This stylistic choice, particularly the keyword saturation, severely compromises the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong imagery in the opening. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting and conceptual jargon that clashes with the mythical tone, such as "aligning his nervous pathways" or "rewire the bitterness." The final paragraphs become repetitive, restating the theme and the box's function, which creates momentum drag and dulls the sharpness of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often beautiful and rhythmic, it suffers from a lack of restraint, becoming overwritten in several passages. The density of figurative language is too high, with metaphors and similes stacked in nearly every sentence, which occasionally blurs clarity and dulls the impact of the strongest images. This tendency toward purple prose is a significant flaw requiring editorial intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it carries a density of figurative language that sometimes slows momentum ("whispered deciduous vows each spring, promising renewal and reminding her..."). There are moments of telling abstract states, such as "the fragile line between care and chaos," where a more concrete image would be stronger. While mostly clean, a few sentences are burdened by carrying too much thematic weight, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose contains striking images, but is often hampered by abstraction and conceptual summary ("whispers of nonlinear inheritance, a concept that..."). There are several prose artifacts, including repetitive phrasing loops like "simply complicated" and "brightened disquiet," which appear multiple times without significant evolution. These redundancies, combined with a tendency to state realizations directly ("He realized that..."), slow the momentum and dilute the impact of the story's most potent ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong control of rhythm and imagery, creating a lush, immersive atmosphere. There is a tendency toward dense, multi-clausal sentences rich with adjectives ("a vaulted chamber lit by phosphorescent fungi, their glow forming a quiet chorus that matches the store’s unheard symphony") that, while beautiful, occasionally verge on being overwritten and slow the momentum slightly. The overall craft is very high, but could benefit from moments of greater concision.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently beautiful, but the extreme density of figurative language in nearly every sentence borders on overwriting, occasionally obscuring action. There are also minor instances of conceptual looping, where ideas are restated with different phrasing without adding new information. A demanding editor would trim this for momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally suffers from a density of abstract concepts and figurative language that can feel overwrought, slowing the momentum. Sentences like "to translate confusion into clarity by merging the fables of absence that the door seemed to recite" are conceptually heavy and prioritize thematic statement over direct sensory experience, creating minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is often evocative, it suffers from significant line-level artifacts that disrupt momentum. The verbatim repetition of phrases like "crack patterns in ice" and the cycling of "hammered repose" and "bloom of hush" creates a template-cadence loop. This redundancy dulls the impact of otherwise strong imagery and suggests a lack of sentence-level polish expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, often beautiful, and creates a strong atmosphere with evocative imagery like "shard of hush" and "sing like thistle." However, there is a recurring conceptual loop around the ideas of coincidence, pattern, and purpose, with the same core idea being rephrased multiple times. This slight redundancy, combined with a somewhat uniform sentence cadence, holds the line-level craft back from excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is often beautiful and rhythmically controlled, it is significantly undermined by repetitive scaffolding. Key phrases—"preemptively nostalgic," "sculpt identity," and especially "deepening hush"—are looped in a way that feels like a prose artifact, dulling momentum. For instance, the paraphrase loop "His mind deepened into a hush... In that deepening hush..." is a clear mark against an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its reliance on dense figurative language in almost every sentence borders on overwriting, slightly dulling the momentum. There are minor instances of repetitive phrasing (e.g., the recurrence of "silent" and "hush"). These line-level artifacts, while not severe, create a texture that is more decorative than propulsive, particularly in the story's second half.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. The constant stream of similes and metaphors, while individually effective, collectively slows the momentum and creates a slightly breathless texture. A greater economy of language in key moments would have allowed the strongest images to land with more force.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with high information density and varied rhythms. The figurative language is rich and largely effective, building the story's unique atmosphere. A minor weakness appears in the final two paragraphs, which lean into summary ("From that day...") rather than sustaining the immediate, resonant imagery of the climax, slightly dulling the final moments with unnecessary scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful ("sunrise caught in glass," "fractured lullabies"), but it suffers from redundancy and overwriting. There are several paraphrase loops concerning Lira's motivation, stating the same idea in slightly different terms. The density of figurative language is at times so high that it slows momentum rather than enhances it. The awkward insertion of "fluidly logical" feels like a jarring artifact from a prompt, disrupting the lyrical flow.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often imagistic, but it suffers from being overwritten. A high density of adjectives and figurative language ("kaleidoscopic," "luminous," "holographic," "fermented") clutters the narrative rather than sharpening it. There are also moments of repetition and near-paraphrasing at the end ("the unclaimed throne" appears four times in quick succession) that feel heavy-handed and blunt the impact of the otherwise clean closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but significantly overwrought, suffering from an excessive density of figurative language that clutters nearly every sentence and dulls momentum. Furthermore, the piece contains a prominent textual artifact: the line "He burned bridges carefully" is repeated with slight variation, creating a loop that reads like a drafting remnant rather than an intentional refrain. These issues of overwriting and repetition obscure the story's elegant structure and prevent the prose from achieving true clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There are no significant mechanical errors. The primary weakness is a form of conceptual looping in the final paragraphs, where the story's thematic resolution is stated and restated in slightly different terms. This redundancy dulls the impact of the ending and creates a slight drag on the otherwise crisp momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from significant repetition and overwriting. Key phrases like "eloquently silent," "bridge of intuition," and "golden shadows" are repeated four times each, functioning as prose artifacts that hammer the theme rather than allowing it to resonate. This looping dulls the momentum and gives the piece a formulaic feel, preventing the otherwise strong descriptive language from achieving its full impact.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it suffers from significant overwriting and repetition. Key phrases ("murmured allegiance," "shivering bliss," "reality shifts") are looped to the point of becoming incantations that lose their initial power, creating a text-artifact issue. The high density of figurative language in nearly every sentence occasionally blurs clarity and stalls momentum. While artful, the lack of concision and the presence of these prose loops prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose contains striking images, such as dust unfurling "like a silent flag." However, it is hampered by occasional overwriting and conceptual loops. For example, "an archive of unknown histories, each filament of dust a reminder of voices that never found a hearing" is a paraphrase loop that restates the same idea. Some emotional beats rely on stock phrasing, like a heart "stitching itself back together," which reduces the specificity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless density of figurative language verges on being overwrought. Momentum is occasionally stalled by sentences that summarize a conceptual effect rather than dramatizing it, such as the line explaining how the transmission "revised histories." This tendency toward abstraction slightly undermines the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by overwriting and repetitive phrasing. Key terms—"radiant grotto," "prism atrium," "prophecy spoken in code," "quietly vivid," "vested hush"—are looped excessively, creating a sense of incantation that quickly becomes a text artifact. This synonym churn and template cadence ("He slipped... He raised... He felt...") obscures momentum and demonstrates a lack of concision, a critical flaw for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative, but at times overwrought with dense adjectival phrases ("ashen skyborne arbor," "moonstone cabochon dust speck") that can slow the momentum. There is some syntactic repetition, creating a cadence that occasionally feels more like a template than a varied rhythm. For example, the parallel structure in "each seed was a letter, each sprout a word..." is effective but emblematic of a pattern that risks becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often evocative, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, there are minor instances of conceptual redundancy, where adjacent sentences restate the core idea of uncertainty in slightly different terms, creating a subtle drag on momentum. The final paragraph shifts into a slightly more abstract, summarizing register that lessens the impact of the concrete scene that preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose contains striking images, such as the seam shining “like a sunrise caught in a river of steel.” However, the overall effect is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of abstract conceptual phrases (“unspoken ledger of truth,” “kintsugi intentions”) that can weigh down the narrative momentum. The final paragraph also contains redundant thematic phrasing that could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can blunt momentum rather than sharpen it. The repetition of the key phrase "luminous ache" feels slightly heavy-handed, and the final paragraph stacks resonant phrases into a "symphony" that borders on excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a sustained high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile ("mind a lattice of bruised memories," "pain to become a scalpel," "moss that glowed like embers"), which occasionally blurs clarity and slows momentum. There is also some conceptual redundancy, with key ideas like the "penance" being restated in slightly different terms.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it suffers from a relentless density of figurative language, where nearly every sentence is weighted with a simile or metaphor. This overwriting occasionally blurs clarity and slows momentum, as in the description of the fragment's pulse, which becomes a cascade of abstractions rather than a sharp, tangible sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The momentum is generally good, though the high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought. The score is constrained by moments of imprecision and repetition, specifically the confusing narration surrounding the two mainspring barrels and the repeated use of the exact phrase "cracks in the façade" and "skillfully observant."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but significantly hampered by overwriting and conceptual redundancy. Many sentences are burdened with dense figurative language, and there are clear instances of paraphrase loops (e.g., "The whisper was a bottled whisper..."). This repetition of ideas ("rustling awakenings," "promise of change," "pulse of a world") clogs the narrative momentum and dulls the impact of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it frequently tips into overwriting, with a density of figurative language that can obscure rather than illuminate. The repetition of the key phrase "burnished sorrow" feels slightly heavy-handed. There is also a tendency to summarize emotional states with labels ("a melancholy sheen that seemed to mourn") instead of grounding them in concrete, sensory detail, which dulls the immediacy of pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with evocative imagery. At times, however, the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought or redundant, as when Alder's motivation "to reclaim the light stolen by midnight" is stated immediately after we're told midnight is stealing the light. These minor instances of overwriting slightly hinder the otherwise excellent momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and demonstrates high information density. However, in several places, the figurative language becomes so dense that it slightly hinders momentum, approaching the edge of being overwritten. For instance, the climax contains a cascade of metaphors ("whirl of star-water," "liquid glass," "staircase of water") that, while beautiful, slightly crowd each other. The craft is very strong but could benefit from a touch more restraint in its most critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    While containing moments of lyrical beauty, the prose is critically flawed by repetitive scaffolding. Key thematic phrases are used as a template cadence, appearing multiple times in nearly identical form, which flattens the rhythm and reads like a mechanical artifact. This loop of core concepts severely damages momentum and gives the piece a programmatic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, which creates a dense but ultimately fatiguing texture that dulls momentum. There are also multiple instances of conceptual looping, where ideas like "dawning hush" and "umbral tenderness" are restated with slight variations rather than developed. This density and repetition obscure the otherwise strong underlying structure and emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose contains striking, beautiful images but is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting and summary. The piece relies heavily on a "She did X, then she did Y" template cadence, telling the audience about key actions rather than dramatizing them. This, combined with paraphrase loops ("searing reverie, a relentless heat..."), dulls the narrative momentum and makes crucial plot advancements feel distant and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, blurring action into abstraction. There are minor but noticeable instances of conceptual paraphrase, where adjacent phrases restate the same idea ("rejected false comfort, refusing the soothing lies"). While the line-level craft is strong, a touch more restraint would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and strong verbs. However, there are minor artifacts that prevent a higher score, such as the paraphrase loop where Harel's purpose is restated ("a pattern the council sought to capture, and his purpose—to archive emotional patterns"). Some figurative language, like the "tapestry of sorrow and hope," borders on the conventional within an otherwise highly original piece.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but overwrought, leading to several issues. There is a tendency toward paraphrase-loops (e.g., "furiously tranquil" followed by "a storm of calm"). Figurative language is stacked so densely it can sometimes obscure meaning. The introduction of the phrase "by decreasing entropy" is a jarring register drift, inserting a scientific concept into a purely magical context without justification, which momentarily breaks the story's spell.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and clean for the most part, with strong imagery like the rope being laid aside "like a retired hymn." However, there are minor instances of abstract summary and slightly awkward phrasing that reduce its power. The sentence "In that moment the humble storm siren tester felt his purpose confirmed..." tells the emotional outcome rather than grounding it in a more concrete sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting and repetition that slightly dulls its impact. For instance, the phrase "flourishing stillness" is repeated three times, and "hush" appears in consecutive sentences, creating minor paraphrase loops. The figurative language is dense throughout, which at times feels more decorative than propulsive, particularly in moments that call for sharper clarity over atmospheric richness.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from severe overwriting due to an excessive density of figurative language. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile ("forgotten dream," "stone lake," "inner fire," "golden chords"), creating a monotonous rhythm and dulling momentum. This constant elevation feels artificial and obscures the narrative beneath a decorative surface.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting, with dense stacks of figurative language, particularly in the opening ("rose like a forgotten lighthouse," "ticking relics," "hourglass of the valley"). While individually effective, their density occasionally slows momentum and makes the prose feel slightly labored rather than effortlessly evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is fatally undermined by pervasive looping and redundancy. Key phrases and entire narrative beats are recycled throughout the text, severely damaging momentum and creating a static feel. This artifact, combined with a tendency towards overwritten, abstract figurative language, obscures clarity and reads as inefficient. The high frequency of these text-artifacts, particularly the paraphrase loops, necessitates a very low score.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, but it frequently tips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can feel strenuous ("living symposium," "conductive tendons"). Repetitive label-like phrases such as "brazen calm" and "gently systematic" function as scaffolding. The line-level craft is ambitious but lacks the concision and rhythmic control of truly exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness. It is severely overwritten, with a relentless density of adjectives and abstract figurative language that smothers the narrative ("luminous skeptic," "melodic echo of far-off chemistry," "bronze quiet resonance"). This self-conscious literary style slows momentum and obscures the story's strong conceptual core under a heavy layer of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with high information density in its imagery. However, it suffers from minor repetition, particularly the overuse of its central phrase "narrow vastness" in the latter half. This conceptual loop slightly dulls the final impact, reading as an unnecessary reinforcement rather than a deepening of an already powerful image, preventing an otherwise immaculate piece of prose from reaching the highest score.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often beautiful at the sentence level, the prose suffers from persistent overwriting. The extreme density of figurative language in nearly every line ("letters trembling like fireflies in a storm," "tinting the revelations") becomes ornamental and detracts from momentum. This stylistic choice, while ambitious, ultimately feels excessive and less impactful than more selective, strategically placed imagery would be.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, and it suffers from minor but noticeable conceptual loops. For example, the idea of the "true north" being both lost and yet still existing is stated multiple times in slightly different phrasing, creating a paraphrase-loop that slows momentum. While the line-level craft is generally strong, these moments of redundancy prevent the prose from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose contains moments of beautiful, evocative imagery ("clouds pulse like living ribbons"). However, there is a tendency toward high figurative density that can feel overwrought, and the final paragraphs suffer from conceptual redundancy, looping over the same ideas about amending wrongs and sharing secrets. While generally clean, these prose artifacts slightly dull the momentum at the story's close.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with a controlled, elevated rhythm. However, it occasionally verges on being overwritten, with a high density of abstract figurative language. The repetition of the phrase “benevolently ruthless” for both Mira and the penumbra feels like a self-conscious authorial echo rather than a natural, resonant connection, slightly cheapening the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("swallowed entire vistas," "shattered like glass"). However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, occasionally leading to stacked metaphors that slightly dull momentum, such as "erupt like storm clouds" immediately following "hidden thunder." While the rhythm and word choice are controlled, a few more moments of stark simplicity could have given the richer passages even greater power.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it is hampered by overwriting. The figurative language is so dense, particularly in the first half, that it sometimes slows momentum and clutters the imagery. While individual phrases are striking, their sheer volume detracts from their power. The piece avoids major grammatical errors, but the relentless metaphorical texture feels more like a stylistic tic than a consistently earned effect.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is ambitious and rhythmically controlled, but its high density of figurative language borders on overwrought, slightly dulling momentum. There is a recurring sentence template for similes ("rose like a wounded beast," "rose like a frozen finger," "rise like the pale spire") that becomes a noticeable authorial tic. While evocative, the line-level craft could be sharpened through greater concision and syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and contains striking images, but it is overwritten. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, which at times lessens its impact and feels strained. The density of metaphors and similes can overwhelm the narrative momentum. For example, the sentence explaining kintsugi is an intrusive, expository moment that breaks the poetic spell rather than trusting the images to convey the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by a significant prose artifact: the word "promise" is used seven times, creating a repetitive loop that dulls the impact of the conclusion. Some figurative language, like "struck me with the force of a tide," feels stock. The high density of ornate phrasing throughout occasionally sacrifices clarity and momentum for lushness, leading to passages that feel slightly overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but frequently overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can blur clarity ("weave a luminous thread through the dawn"). There are instances of paraphrase-loops where adjacent phrases restate the same emotional content, such as "a screaming tenderness surge through her, a fierce love that shouted silently." While evocative, this density and repetition slightly bog down the momentum in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density in its figurative language. However, it occasionally falls into a patterned cadence ("each ring a whisper," "each call painted," "each metallic click resonated," "each soldered joint a confession"). This template-like structure, while thematically coherent, slightly dulls the propulsion in the middle section. The repetition of key abstract nouns ("loss," "solace," "sorrow") also creates minor conceptual loops instead of always advancing the idea.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.5)
    While containing striking individual images, the prose is overwrought, with a density of figurative language that slows momentum and occasionally blurs meaning. Nearly every sentence strains for poetic effect, resulting in a texture that feels uniformly elevated rather than modulating with the scene's pressure. This stylistic density becomes an artifact that keeps the reader at an analytical distance from the story's emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often evocative, the prose suffers from overwriting and repetition. The key phrase "softly persistent" is used four times, and "borrowed memory" three times, dulling their impact. The density of figurative language in some passages feels excessive, and a few adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea, creating slight momentum drag that undercuts the otherwise strong rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant and concise, with strong momentum. However, a few moments rely on familiar similes ("set his resolve like a compass needle") that feel slightly out of place amidst the more original imagery. The final paragraph contains scaffolding ("Thus, the lonely antique map dealer found his solitude transformed...") that flattens the rhythm and states what has already been implied, preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, with a relentless density of figurative language that often slows momentum and obscures action. Several phrases read as text-artifacts, most notably the illogical repetition of "a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" at the climax. This straining for poetic effect consistently undermines clarity and narrative propulsion, representing the story's most substantial flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose has a lyrical quality but is hampered by conceptual redundancy and repetition that dulls momentum. Key phrases ("revalue," "returning differently," "ember nexus at twilight," "a secret is whispered between friends") are repeated in a way that feels more like an artifact than a purposeful motif. This looping, combined with abstract terminology like "density of presence," creates a texture that is sometimes more declarative than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is ambitious but frequently overwritten, with a density of figurative language that can obscure meaning rather than clarify it ("each word a feathered attempt to make the chaos fly straight"). Some sentences feel labored and conceptual, creating rhythmic stumbling blocks. While many images are striking, the overall effect is one of strain, lacking the concision and momentum needed for flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of figurative language that approaches overwriting, creating a rhythm that is lush but monotonous. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, which dulls the impact of individual images. For instance, the opening paragraph alone layers multiple metaphors ("exhaled a thin mist," "cartographer, mapping emotional terrain," "whispered silhouette"), which slows momentum rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from distinct text artifacts that hinder momentum. There are clear paraphrase loops ("letting the silence saturate the scene, a saturated hush") and conceptual redundancies ("She held that breath during a held breath"). The high density of figurative language, while atmospheric, sometimes feels overwrought, and these recurrent loops constitute a notable flaw that dulls the story's otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from a pervasive density of figurative language, with nearly every sentence laden with a simile or metaphor. This overwriting, while thematically aligned, clogs momentum and dulls the impact of individual images. The piece would be significantly stronger with more concision and a more selective use of its primary stylistic device.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    While rhythmically strong, the prose suffers from significant overwriting and conceptual looping. Nearly every sentence is freighted with dense, stacked metaphors, which often dulls momentum rather than sharpens it. Phrases like "resounding hush" and the core concept of unification are repeated in slightly different terms, creating redundancy instead of progression.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but at times its density of figurative language borders on overwriting, slightly slowing the momentum in key moments. Phrases like "the fine lines of a shoreline that the tide respects" are beautiful but add a layer of abstraction where a more concrete image might land with more force. The piece avoids major artifacts but could benefit from a final pass for concision.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose is clean, it tends towards overwriting, with a high density of figurative language and abstract concepts that are often stated and then immediately paraphrased ("Letting go - was not surrender but the precise release of tension..."). Key phrases like "quiet wildfire" and "familiar strangers" are repeated to the point of becoming scaffolds rather than resonant motifs. This lack of concision and reliance on telling over showing slows the momentum, particularly around thematic declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it is also overwrought, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes feels decorative rather than propulsive. There are several instances of telling over showing, particularly in the statement of motivation and the summary of the final insight. The final paragraph loops back through the story's key terms, feeling more like a concluding summary than a resonant final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, there are moments of conceptual redundancy and scaffolding, especially in the final third. The last paragraph explains the very system the story has just shown us, a paraphrase-loop that dulls the impact of the closure by summarizing what should be left to resonate. This tendency to explain weakens an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and repetition, which severely dulls its impact. Key phrases—"regenerated covenant," "haunted euphoria," "gently thorough," "proximate causes"—are repeated to the point of becoming distracting text artifacts. This synonym churn and conceptual looping create sluggish momentum and make the narrative feel formulaic. While individual sentences can be beautiful, the lack of concision and the template-like cadence ultimately obscure the story's emotional core under layers of decorative language.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and imaginative, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, there is a tendency toward high conceptual density, with multiple abstract thematic phrases clustered together ("catalyze a network of empathy, a chain reaction that would bind strangers together by reciprocity"). While beautiful, this occasionally borders on overwriting, summarizing the theme rather than letting the concrete actions carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery. However, it sometimes suffers from overwriting, with a high density of figurative language ("quiet blaze," "river of sound," "veil of sound") that can feel stacked and slightly repetitive. While technically clean, the sentence structure could benefit from more rhythmic variety to enhance momentum, particularly in the final paragraph which reads more like a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but overwritten, with figurative language packed so densely it sometimes obscures rather than clarifies ("humming with a low, steady tide of spacetime curvature"). Several phrases feel like well-worn literary constructs ("threshed meaning from experience," "tapestry of intentional threads"). The density of metaphor in high-pressure moments slows momentum and feels more performative than organic. (-0.7 overwriting penalty).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is frequently beautiful but walks a fine line with overwriting, using stacked figurative language and emotional labeling ("joyful sorrow... mournful beauty... light and heavy"). The disastrous final sentence is a jarring and inappropriate shift in register from poetic to expository.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose aims for a high lyrical register but is hampered by recurring artifacts. The phrase "volcanic tenderness" is repeated, and there is a tendency toward modifier-heavy sentences ("fierce love tempered by the gentle heat of remembrance") that occasionally feel overwritten. This density can obscure momentum, particularly in the story's second half.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is rich and evocative, with strong sensory detail. However, it occasionally borders on being overwritten, with dense clusters of figurative language in nearly every sentence that can slightly impede momentum. There's also some conceptual redundancy, such as the repetition of "entangled memories" and "tangled recollections." The final paragraphs lose some propulsion by summarizing the after-effects rather than ending on a final, sharp image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and generally precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Momentum is well-maintained through clear, propulsive sentences. Minor deductions are for a few instances of template cadence ("He lifted one, placed the coin..., and turned the knob...") and a noticeable repetition of the "vein" metaphor, which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is ambitious, it suffers from conspicuous repetition that creates a template-like cadence. Phrases like "spiralingly calm," "shutters of water," and "stillwater tension" are recycled to the point of becoming prose artifacts that dull momentum. The unrelenting density of figurative language in almost every sentence also borders on overwriting, occasionally obscuring meaning rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose, while ambitious, is overwrought due to an excessive density of figurative language. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor ("dust danced like quiet fireflies," "mist...like breath," "pieces as if they were heartbeats"), creating a patterned artifact that dulls the impact of individual images and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with figurative language stacked so densely it occasionally blurs meaning. There are several conceptual loops, particularly around "unlocking guarded hearts," where the same idea is rephrased across adjacent sentences, slowing momentum at the climax. A sentence like "the crystal unlocked by the call of a whale from the deep" is a redundant paraphrase of the action just shown, acting as scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, with strong, memorable images. However, it occasionally suffers from a pattern of conceptual scaffolding, where an abstract idea is stated and then immediately illustrated, creating a slight redundancy. There are also minor paraphrase loops that could be tightened for greater momentum, such as repeating the word "story" in the line about the flowers' purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and repetition. Figurative language is so dense it occasionally obscures meaning, and paraphrase loops occur frequently (e.g., stating the poet's purpose in two near-identical clauses). The recurring "tremor of certainty" phrase, while tracking a change, becomes a scaffold that dulls the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The primary weakness is overwriting. Nearly every sentence is freighted with similes and metaphors ("canvases tucked under her arm like fragile promises," "metal surfaces shimmering like a tongue ready to speak"), creating a dense, overwrought texture that slows momentum. This pervasive figurative density is a stylistic artifact that obscures clarity in key moments, preventing the prose from achieving the clean propulsion required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose contains beautiful moments but is severely hampered by recurring text artifacts. There are noticeable paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancies, with the idea of "connection" restated in multiple, slightly different ways, dulling its impact. The repetition of key phrases like "powerfully gentle" and the relentless density of figurative language create a sense of overwriting. These patterns obscure momentum and feel more like algorithmic tics than deliberate craft.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, its own richness occasionally becomes a liability. The density of figurative language is relentless, at times bordering on overwriting, and a few phrases verge on cliché ("stripped her of sparkle"). There are also minor instances of conceptual redundancy, such as restating the purpose of the cranes, which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is highly ambitious, with dense, poetic prose that largely succeeds. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraph, where a few sentences shift from showing to summarizing ("The story of the loft... would travel onward..."), which slightly diffuses the momentum of the otherwise sharp ending.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but significantly overwritten. Nearly every sentence is saturated with figurative language, which numbs the reader and obscures momentum. There is considerable conceptual repetition around the ideas of nostalgia, joy/sorrow, and unpredictability, creating paraphrase loops that slow the narrative without adding new information. These artifacts prevent the prose from achieving clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant but is weakened by a recurring pattern of abstract noun phrases and synonym-adjacent descriptors (e.g., "softly deliberate," "quiet reverence"). Several sentences follow a "He [action], feeling [emotion]" template, creating a repetitive cadence that dulls momentum. While the imagery is strong, these line-level artifacts prevent the prose from achieving flawless clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often evocative, the line-level craft is hampered by overwriting and conceptual redundancy, particularly through paraphrase loops ("steadier, no longer trembling but anchored") that dilute momentum at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and demonstrates strong command of rhythm and imagery. However, the recurring phrase "meteor hush" appears three times, functioning as a stylistic tic that slightly diminishes its impact by the final mention. This minor prose artifact, a form of loop, prevents a higher score by betraying a moment of authorial habit over fresh articulation in an otherwise stellar piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from an unrelenting density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, which flattens the texture and diminishes the impact of the most crucial images. A slight logical inconsistency—the film strip melting into liquid light and then being placed back in the projector—also detracts from an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, creating a dense, overwrought texture that dulls momentum and can obscure the action ("pulsed like quiet hearts," "fell like a sigh," "cascade of light"). This relentless piling of metaphors and similes reads as a stylistic tic that prioritizes decorative language over clarity and propulsion, which is a major barrier to publication.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often beautiful, its relentless density of figurative language approaches overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor ("metronome of sighs," "petals of sand," "blooming cactus"), which risks exhausting the reader and slightly dulling the impact of the most critical images. Furthermore, the repetition of the key phrase "fractured lullaby" three times feels slightly heavy-handed, a prose artifact that could have been handled with more variation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is severely hampered by the repetitive looping of key thematic phrases ("hum of insight," "probable miracles," "wild frontier of his mind"). This text artifact dulls momentum and reads like mechanical reinforcement, creating a template-like cadence that undermines the story's otherwise evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant overwriting and redundancy. There are multiple paraphrase loops and instances of synonym churn ("shoreline lullaby," "chorus of waves," "sea's lullaby") that dull momentum rather than build it. The final paragraphs are laden with repetitive thematic statements, a prose artifact that measurably weakens the closure by summarizing what was already shown, violating the principle of concision.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought and slows momentum. There is a noticeable pattern of repeating key phrases ("unpardonable silence," "seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope") that functions more like a scaffold than an evolving motif. This lexical illusion and repetition, while creating a hypnotic rhythm, ultimately constitutes a prose artifact that slightly dulls the story's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a relentless density of figurative language, creating an overwrought texture ("hushed cathedral," "planetary presence," "slow tide," "graceful collapse"). This leads to a lack of rhythmic variety and momentum drag. The final paragraph devolves into a summary of events the reader just witnessed, a critical flaw that breaks from showing and tells the story's legacy instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant text artifacts that harm momentum and clarity. The cyclical repetition of thematic phrases ("periodically eternal," "drifting moored," "delayed revelation") functions as a loop that loses impact with each use. Overwriting and dense, abstract declarations ("a symptom of the reefs’ loss of direction") often replace concrete dramatization, particularly during moments of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and rhythmically controlled, particularly in the opening. However, the story relies on repeating its core abstract concepts—"thunderous serenity" and "awkward confidence" appear multiple times—creating a conceptual loop that borders on a prose artifact. While effective initially, this repetition slightly dulls the momentum and reduces the information density in later beats, feeling more like a recurring motif than an evolving description.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose contains striking, memorable images, such as the moss singing in "hushed green whispers" and the kite's tail "fluttering like a broken prayer." These moments are balanced by a reliance on abstract conceptual phrases ("a seed of evolution," "a living bridge") that summarize meaning rather than grounding it in sensory detail. The line-level craft is strong but inconsistent in its concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and excessive conceptual density in key moments, such as describing a scent as "anchoring optimism in realism." Some sentences are burdened with abstraction rather than conveying concrete sensory experience, which slows momentum. While many images are sharp, the tendency toward complex, multi-clause constructions can feel labored.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it veers into overwriting. The repetition of the key phrase "luminescent ache" slightly dulls its impact by the end. The high density of figurative language throughout creates a uniformly elevated texture that could benefit from more variation and moments of plainer language to heighten contrast and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious, with strong verbs and vivid imagery. However, it suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally becomes a "metaphor stack," cluttering the scene rather than clarifying it. Crucial moments of insight are often delivered through summary ("He realized that...") rather than being fully dramatized, a prose-level choice that dampens the story's immediacy at pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is hampered by significant overwriting. The density of similes and metaphors in nearly every paragraph ("like skeletal trees," "like a shiver," "like frost on glass") becomes a stylistic tic that dulls the impact of individual images. This, combined with some repetitive key phrases, weighs down the narrative momentum and prevents the otherwise strong prose from achieving excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and repetition that dulls its momentum. The phrase "tranquil blaze" is used four times, creating a prose loop. Figurative language is dense but often generic ("trembling with possibility," "sunrise of amber fire"), and adjacent sentences frequently restate the same idea in slightly different terms. These artifacts weigh down the otherwise evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting. The density of figurative language is so high it borders on becoming a prose artifact, with nearly every sentence containing a complex metaphor ("stitched with sleepwalking constellations," "vessel that transliterates emotions"). This can obscure momentum and feels slightly labored. A grammatical error in a key sentence ("it translates his quiet longing" instead of "translated") in the final third is a notable flaw that prevents a higher score for a piece aiming for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from an excessive density of figurative language, with nearly every sentence containing a simile or metaphor. This stylistic choice, while initially evocative, becomes overwrought, slowing momentum and occasionally blurring meaning. This consistent overwriting prevents the prose from achieving the clean propulsion required for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative and rich with imagery, but its high density of figurative language sometimes verges on overwriting, slightly dulling momentum. More significantly, the final paragraphs contain conceptual loops, restating the new state of calm multiple times. The explicit thematic summary reads like scaffolding that should have been removed, marring an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a density that occasionally impedes momentum. There are noticeable prose artifacts, such as the template cadence in "Each line was a question, each curve a tentative answer," and "Each grain of sand became a memory..." This repetitive structure, while lyrical, feels mechanical and slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    While often lyrical, the prose is burdened by overwriting and conceptual redundancy. Key ideas ("warm coldness," "aberrant mercy," "steel and empathy") are paraphrased and repeated across multiple sentences, dulling momentum. The density of abstract nouns and figurative language becomes overwhelming, particularly in the final third, creating a text that feels more like an ornate description of an idea than a story with propulsive energy.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lyrical and inventive, with strong, rhythmic sentences. At times, however, the density of figurative language becomes excessive, bordering on overwriting that slightly impedes momentum ("leaves whispering in synesthetic harmony, turning sound into sight and scent into rhythm"). While consistently beautiful, a more varied application of this dense style would heighten the impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean grammatically but suffers from a lack of concision and momentum due to abstract language and conceptual loops. Sentences like "The hope that rose within her was not naive; it was a willowglass hope..." are overwritten, explaining an emotional state instead of showing it. The frequent use of technical terms ("fractally precise," "somatic markers") without sufficient grounding creates a dense, sluggish texture that stalls narrative propulsion in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. However, it is weakened by moments of scaffolding, particularly the direct statement of motivation ("Her motivation was simple yet profound"). The thematic summary in the final third also functions as a paraphrase loop, restating what the action has already demonstrated, which slightly dulls the momentum of an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that prevent a higher score. The phrase "as the truth unravels" is repeated, and the structure "She understood/realized that..." creates a slight template cadence. These small loops and scaffolding phrases slightly dull the momentum in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from overwriting, with a very high density of figurative language that can feel excessive and patterned rather than organic. Phrases like "stitched together the torn memories with the hope of tomorrow" lean towards cliché. The relentless lyricism sometimes blurs the line between evocative description and purple prose, slightly impeding momentum in what should be taut moments.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the prose contains striking images, it is severely hampered by text artifacts. The story is built on a scaffold of repeated keywords ("palimpsest," "percolate," "spindrift," etc.), creating a looping effect that feels artificial and prompt-driven. This structural repetition dulls the momentum and impact of an otherwise poetic line-level craft, preventing the work from feeling fully immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from overwriting, with a relentless density of figurative language that occasionally dulls its impact. A significant flaw is the jarring image of "chimney smoke," which breaks the established logic of the "scorched wasteland" setting and feels imported from another context. Additionally, there are minor redundancies, such as the line "confirming its phototropic nature," which merely explains the action just shown.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from conspicuous repetition of key phrases ("quivering hush," "rhythm of oars in water," "protected vulnerability"). This creates a scaffold-like effect, as if reinforcing required elements, which dulls the momentum and feels programmatic. This verbal looping, particularly of the most stylized phrases, prevents the line-level craft from achieving the seamless, invisible quality required for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.0)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from overwriting and redundancy. Figurative language is so dense it sometimes obscures rather than clarifies. The piece relies heavily on repeating key phrases ("atomically reflective," "brittle awakenings," "translate isolation into independence"), creating conceptual loops that stall momentum instead of deepening meaning, a clear prose artifact that would require significant editing.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from an unrelenting density of figurative language. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile ("sequined ribbons," "soft veil," "silken line"), which borders on overwriting and can fatigue the reader. This stylistic choice, while initially beautiful, ultimately muddles narrative momentum and clarity in key moments, dulling the story's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often evocative, but it occasionally relies on summarizing pivotal moments instead of dramatizing them through concrete action and sensory detail. While the overall effect is strong, moments of abstraction—like describing anxiety dissolving rather than showing its effects fade—create a slight drag on momentum. The final line, while thematically consistent, lands as a platitude that somewhat dulls the otherwise sharp ending.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and strong verbs. However, it occasionally tips into overwriting, with a heavy reliance on abstract nouns and figurative language that can feel stacked ("spatial mutiny," "tyranny of gravity," "bittersweet resonance"). Some sentences, while poetic, become slightly cumbersome and slow the momentum in high-pressure moments. The piece avoids major artifacts like loops, but a tighter rein on the lyrical density would increase its propulsive power.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but veers into being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel strenuous. There is also conceptual repetition that borders on scaffolding, such as the multiple uses of "unifying opposites" and "furrowed hush." While the line-level craft is strong, a more disciplined economy of language would heighten the momentum and impact of its best images.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels overwrought. The recurring phrase "spongey dread," while purposeful as a motif, appears three times and borders on becoming a stylistic tic rather than a freshly felt sensation. This repetition, combined with the overall richness, slightly weighs down the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, creating a density that often blurs meaning and slows momentum. There are clear instances of text-artifact loops, such as the triple repetition of "luminous disbelief" and the verbatim repetition of the story's theme. These issues of scaffold and purple prose obscure the otherwise strong imagery and detract from the story's power, especially at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, but it is held back by noticeable text artifacts. There are several instances of paraphrase loops and recurring phrases (e.g., "polished calm," "dusky harmony") that act as scaffolding and slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft. These repetitions create a template-like echo in key moments, preventing the prose from reaching flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is rich with figurative language but suffers from overwriting and repetition, dulling its momentum. Phrases and concepts like "heals with words," "shared burdens," and "midnight solace" are looped with minor variations, creating conceptual redundancy. This density, while atmospheric, often prioritizes telling and abstraction over sharp, forward-moving action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but severely overwritten, suffering from an excessive density of figurative language that dulls its own impact. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor ("howled like distant drums," "collapses like a wounded bird," "a calm blade"), creating a turgid rhythm that impedes momentum. While grammatically clean, the lack of concision and the relentless adornment obscure the story's strong structural bones.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains striking, beautiful phrases but suffers from a pervasive density of figurative language that creates a monotonous rhythm and occasionally obscures meaning. Nearly every sentence strives for poetic effect, which paradoxically dulls the impact of key moments. Several adjacent sentences restate the same idea with different metaphors, creating paraphrase loops that slow momentum, such as the description of her motivation followed by the "collective longing" clause.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often evocative, the prose is burdened by overwriting and structural redundancy. Several sentences contain paraphrase-loops where the second half merely restates the first (e.g., "Each step...a trammel..., a deliberate obstacle..."). This, combined with some strained figurative language ("idealism that glittered"), creates momentum drag and obscures the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, with strong sensory details. However, it is hampered by occasional overwriting and stacked metaphors, such as "letting the facts I recorded become a scaffolding that insulated my fear, allowing me to stand steadier on the uneven ground of my rebirth." These instances, along with the tell-not-show summary of the "day's lesson," create prose artifacts that slightly dull the momentum and clarity of key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong imagery like the "cascade of silver particles that drifted like snow." However, there are moments of conceptual redundancy and abstract phrasing that slow the momentum. For example, the description of her ambitions as a "lonely climb up an invisible ladder" and then a "spiral of magnetic vines" covers similar ground, creating a minor paraphrase loop that could have been consolidated for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with powerful imagery like "a sunrise trapped in stone." However, there are minor instances of telling that could have been shown, such as "the librarian sensed a collective yearning." The final paragraph's summary statement slightly flattens the rhythm. While the overall craft is high, these moments of slight abstraction and a few repetitive sentence stems ("He decided," "He placed") prevent it from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a persistent overwriting impulse, with a high density of figurative language that can feel stacked and repetitive. For example, adjacent descriptions like "resonant hush," "soft, trembling gleam," and "whispered ancient lullabies" create a similar effect without adding new information. This tendency toward synonym-heavy description and paraphrase loops ("casting a golden cascade that crowned the cavern's ceiling with a halo") slightly dulls the momentum and impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains strong imagery but is hampered by conceptual loops and repetition that slow momentum. The "map" metaphor is stated four or five times in rapid succession, and the phrase "daringly methodical" appears three times, feeling like a scaffold rather than an organic thought. These repetitions create redundancy instead of deepening the meaning, particularly the overuse of the map concept which dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is often evocative but is marred by repetitive phrasing and modifier-stacking that can dull momentum. The phrase "cautious exuberance" is used as a scaffold three times, a significant loop in a story this short. While individual images are strong, the sentence-level craft lacks the concision and variety needed for truly top-tier work, occasionally feeling overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting, with nearly every sentence laden with dense, often abstract, figurative language ("perforated destiny," "lattice of veins," "gilded annex"). This creates a conceptual haze that sometimes obscures the action and emotion. The density feels more like an applied style than an organic expression of the character's perception under pressure, ultimately slowing the momentum and dulling the clarity of pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, but its relentless density of figurative language borders on being overwritten, occasionally slowing momentum. While mostly effective, the final paragraphs slip into summarizing the story's meaning ("the act of infusing the chip was not merely a rescue... but a covenant"), which undermines the preceding scene work. This shift from showing to telling is a notable flaw in an otherwise polished piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it borders on being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally becomes a "pretty-prose" template ("A warm amber light flooded the grotto, and the stone seemed to breathe... lingered like a quiet hymn"). The repetition of certain words ("scallop," "hush") and concepts in close proximity creates minor prose loops that slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.5)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. The prose is overwritten, suffering from stacked metaphors and conceptual redundancy (e.g., "cloaked in the weight" and "cloak of doubt"). There are numerous paraphrase loops and instances of synonym churn that slow the pace and dull the impact of key images. These pervasive prose artifacts significantly weigh down an otherwise strong conceptual piece.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from a persistent density of figurative language, with similes and metaphors in nearly every sentence, which ultimately dilutes their impact. There are also several instances of conceptual paraphrase loops, where adjacent sentences restate the same idea in slightly different terms. These issues of overwriting and redundancy weigh on the narrative momentum, particularly for a piece aiming for such precision.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often evocative, with strong imagery. However, it is weakened by a persistent pattern of paraphrase loops, where adjacent sentences or clauses restate the same idea using different words (e.g., "The pulse was a faint thrum that never ceased, a reminder that the world still breathed..."). This redundancy and over-reliance on abstract nouns ("reverence," "continuity," "resolve") slightly dulls the momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong control of rhythm and imagery. However, the story relies heavily on the repetition of key phrases ("lingering luminance," "accommodates impossibilities," "garden folly," "brilliant dimness"). While this creates a thematic echo consistent with the accumulative mode, its frequency creates a prose artifact that feels slightly mechanical and overwrought by the end, dulling the impact of the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery. However, it borders on being overwritten, with a high concentration of figurative language that can occasionally slow momentum. A key flaw is the clunky, expository sentence used to explain the riddle's solution, which reads as a scaffold to patch a logic gap rather than elegant prose.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, but it suffers from a pervasive density of figurative language. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or poetic descriptor ("rusted dome of forgotten suns," "murmurs of the ancient metal," "cracks of time"). This high level of stylistic saturation, while atmospheric, verges on overwriting and slightly dulls the narrative momentum by making every moment equally intense.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it occasionally suffers from a lack of concision and slight overwriting. There is a paraphrase loop in “phrases long lost to the world, the very echoes forgotten phrases,” which dulls momentum. While many images are sharp, others like “conduits of luminous memory” lean into abstraction where a more concrete sensory detail would have been stronger, a minor but persistent issue that holds the piece back from flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from an over-density of figurative language that approaches overwriting, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. More damaging are the conceptual loops in the final third, where the story's theme is paraphrased multiple times across adjacent sentences. This redundancy dulls the impact of the otherwise strong closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, there are instances of overwriting and conceptual repetition that create minor drag. The recurring use of "hush" and "mirrored" becomes a noticeable tic, and abstract phrases like "precisely humane" lack concrete grounding, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and a varied sentence structure that propels the narrative. However, there's a tendency toward overwriting, where the density of figurative language in nearly every sentence creates a uniformly lush texture that can dull the impact of key moments. A few phrases, like a cold that "whispered promises" or a freshness that "wrapped around her like a promise fulfilled," lean towards well-worn convention.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and redundancy. Phrases like "whispering in a soundless echo" are paradoxical and ornate, while paraphrase loops ("remembering through muscle memory," "His hands moved without thought...a silent metronome guiding his...work") clutter the narrative. The relentless density of figurative language often obscures rather than clarifies, slowing momentum in what should be tense moments.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clear but leans heavily on conceptual jargon and repetition of key phrases ("slicing through pretense," "vivify"), which reads like scaffolding. A few paragraphs devolve into abstract summary that kills momentum, particularly the one beginning "The method was simple yet profound..." This dilutes the power of the otherwise clean climax.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, but it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting and conceptual density, especially during the climax. Phrases like "fragrance that seemed to rewrite the night itself" and "woven mystery, design, and nature into a single breath of wonder" stack abstractions. This density can obscure the concrete action and slightly dull the momentum, preventing the otherwise strong line-level craft from achieving true clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, with figurative language stacked so densely in nearly every sentence that it becomes overwhelming and blurs clarity. There are also instances of paraphrase loops, such as describing the sound "macerating" the silence in similar terms in consecutive paragraphs. These artifacts weigh down the story's momentum and distract from its emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, particularly an excessive density of figurative language that can blur meaning rather than clarify it. Several sentences rely on conceptual paraphrase, stating an idea and then immediately restating it in different terms ("fog swirled with a lucidity that felt both hazy and crystal, mirroring the guardian’s own conflicted clarity"). This tendency toward abstraction and redundancy dulls the narrative momentum and detracts from the otherwise elegant word choice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is rich with imagery but teeters on being overwritten. The density of figurative language is consistently high, slowing momentum and occasionally creating conceptual loops where an image is described in terms of another recurring image ("a trembling hue that mirrors the frozen bloom"). While many individual phrases are beautiful, a lack of concision and syntactic variety slightly dulls the story's propulsive force.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains striking images, but suffers from overwriting and repetition. The phrase "serenely electric" appears three times, becoming a tic rather than a reinforcement. The final paragraphs become less imagistic and more explanatory, slowing momentum with abstract statements. While many individual sentences are well-crafted, the overall effect is one of high density without corresponding propulsion, especially near the end where clarity and impact are crucial.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong imagery like the "lattice of sound." However, it occasionally slips into overwriting, with a high density of abstract nouns and conceptual pairings ("a paradox of permanence and transience," "a permanent transient heartbeat"). These phrases, while tonally consistent, can feel more like intellectual assertions than concrete, line-level craft, slightly dulling the story's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    While often beautiful and imagistic, the prose is hampered by recurring artifacts. Several key phrases are repeated to the point of becoming a noticeable template, and the final paragraph engages in summary and paraphrase that dulls the momentum of the closing image. The information density is high, but not always efficient, with moments of redundancy that could be sharpened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, there are minor instances of abstract summary diluting concrete moments, and the final paragraph contains some redundancy. The explanation of the chain link's meaning feels like a paraphrase loop, stating a concept that the preceding action and imagery had already successfully shown, slightly dulling the final beat's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose demonstrates rhythmic control but is hampered by overwriting. The density of figurative language is excessive, with nearly every sentence containing a simile or metaphor, which dulls the impact of individual images and slows momentum. This pervasive pattern of ornamentation reads as a stylistic artifact that values texture over clarity and concision, especially in moments that would benefit from starker prose.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lyrical and information-dense, with powerful imagery and varied sentence structures. At times, the density of figurative language is so high it borders on overwriting, slightly diminishing the impact of individual images. Overall, the line-level craft is excellent, demonstrating a high degree of control and artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious, with striking imagery and a controlled rhythm, but it consistently operates at such a high figurative density that it borders on being overwritten. The primary flaw is the inclusion of thematic scaffolding, particularly in the final paragraphs, which reads like an authorial intrusion and disrupts narrative momentum. The core craft is strong but lacks crucial restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with powerful, evocative figurative language. However, its relentless density occasionally tips into overwriting, with a few phrases feeling more like thematic labels than organic descriptions (e.g., "transformed from whispered legend into audible sculpture"). A slightly more restrained hand in a few key moments would allow the strongest images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often lands with striking imagery, but it suffers from a high density of abstract figurative language ("gravitationally playful," "cosmic joke," "icy optimism") packed tightly together, which can blur clarity. Some conceptual beats feel repetitive, and the final paragraphs lapse into summary, scaffolding the theme rather than letting the closing image resonate on its own. While the line-level craft is often beautiful, this tendency toward abstraction and explanation holds it back from excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but weakened by noticeable artifacts. The phrase "resonantly soft" is repeated four times, becoming a tic that loses power with each use. Furthermore, several sentences in the climax follow a templated "He did X, and Y happened" structure, which creates a mechanical cadence that slightly flattens the otherwise powerful imagery of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is hampered by a relentless density of figurative language that verges on overwriting ("banner of surrender," "metallic bird," "frightened sparrow," "dust of old grudges"). There are also moments of redundancy, such as the repeated phrasing around broken promises and voids. This stylistic excess, particularly the conceptual loop in "a truth he pursued to find where broken promises heal," slightly dulls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is rich but suffers from overwriting and repetition that dull its momentum. Conceptual loops are a primary issue, such as the line "...silence was not emptiness but possibility, a soft canvas upon which she could interpret silence as possibility." This and other recurring phrases ("quietly persistent," "whispering gleam") create a templated cadence that feels more like a response to a prompt than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from relentless figurative density. Nearly every sentence is freighted with a metaphor or abstract concept ("lattice of ink and photon," "Möbius strip of story"). This overwriting, while thematically consistent, creates a uniform, breathless rhythm that dulls momentum and occasionally blurs clarity. The lack of variation in sentence texture is a significant artifact that keeps the craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its high density of figurative language sometimes verges on overwriting, creating a decorative layer rather than driving momentum. The repetition of the key term "vitalize" (four times) slightly dulls its impact, reading as a minor prose artifact. While rhythmically strong, the relentless lyricism could benefit from moments of greater simplicity to heighten contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is persistently overwritten, with nearly every sentence striving for poetic density, which ultimately flattens the rhythm and momentum. There are multiple instances of template cadence ("Each step echoed a question, each echo a promise...") and paraphrase loops that state and restate abstract concepts. The reliance on intangible nouns ("possibilities," "secrets," "longing," "fear") as agents creates a sense of detachment and clutters pivotal moments with abstraction instead of concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally slows momentum and feels overwrought. Sentences are frequently laden with multiple metaphors or similes, creating a texture that is rich but lacks concision. Phrases like "a crisp nostalgia that filled her lungs" lean toward cliché, and the repetition of key symbolic language ("broken constellations") borders on heavy-handedness, showing the scaffolding of the story's construction.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the figurative language is so dense that it approaches overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile ("ancient whispers," "blade of a promise," "ribbons of gold," "metallic hymn"), which can saturate the narrative and slightly dull the impact of key moments. This relentless density is the primary line-level craft issue preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from significant artifacts that would require editorial intervention. The recursive phrase "hope had taken root upon the hush of budding hope" is a clear paraphrase loop that stalls momentum. The repetition of keywords like "succor" (5 times) and "radiant hush" (3 times) feels more like a heavy-handed insistence than an elegant motif. This density of self-conscious lyricism borders on overwriting and clouds the narrative's otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with many powerful images. However, the density of figurative language is relentless, at times risking an overwrought, "purple" texture where nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor. While this supports the lyrical tone, a more selective application would allow the strongest images—like spirits flickering "like a pale fish"—to land with even greater force. The repetition of phrases like "interlaced hush" is patterned and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and dense with imagery, but it suffers from several instances of conceptual looping and paraphrase. Phrases like "shielded openness" are repeated, and adjacent sentences often restate the same idea with different words ("She believed the silence...could be read...a conviction that guided every line she drew"). These redundancies slightly slow the momentum and betray a lack of confidence in the initial phrasing's power.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, but it suffers from overwriting and conceptual redundancy in key moments. The story repeatedly paraphrases its core theme of "letting go" using different abstract formulations, which dulls the impact. This tendency towards synonym churn on a thematic level, particularly near the end, slows momentum and reduces the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently lyrical and inventive. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high, with nearly every sentence containing a metaphor or simile ("pulsed like a living circuit," "ghost in code sheathed in vapor," "tinkersong of electric hues"). While often effective, this relentless density occasionally approaches overwriting, slightly blurring clarity and momentum in a few passages through sheer accretion of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from being overwritten. The density of figurative language is relentless, and key emotional states are asserted through repeated labels rather than shown through varied action. This creates a self-conscious "literary" texture that occasionally slows momentum and dulls the immediacy of the discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from overwriting. The sheer density of figurative language, with metaphors or similes in nearly every sentence, can overwhelm the narrative and blunt the impact of individual images rather than sharpening them, creating a slightly breathless effect.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery. However, it suffers from a few minor but noticeable artifacts. The phrase "fractally precise" is repeated, functioning as a prose tic that lessens its impact. While the dense figurative language is generally effective, it occasionally borders on being overwritten, slightly impeding the otherwise strong forward momentum of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most sentences. The rhythm and syntax are generally varied and support the story's momentum. There are minor instances of overwriting and a noticeable template cadence in the final paragraph ("She had noted... decoded... and coaxed..."), which slightly flattens the prose at a key moment but doesn't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from an over-density of figurative language, particularly similes ("like old driftwood," "like sea-foam," "like frozen rain," "like a whisper," "like snowflakes"). This high frequency of comparisons, combined with some stock phrasing ("fingers trembling"), slightly dulls the momentum and gives moments a pre-fabricated feel. This stylistic tic is the primary barrier to the story achieving the highest echelon of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    While containing moments of evocative description, the prose is hampered by overwritten, abstract emotional language like "brambled hope that twined through their hearts." This tendency toward telling emotions rather than embodying them through concrete action dulls the story's impact. There is a reliance on summary in key moments where dramatization would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and repetition, which dulls the story’s impact. The phrase “bruised awe” is used three times, becoming a distracting prose artifact rather than a powerful motif. The high density of figurative language in nearly every sentence smothers the narrative momentum, and the piece would be far stronger with more concision and variation at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, polished, and evocative, with high information density in every line. Figurative language, such as "the frost retreats like a dying dragon," is consistently inventive and enhances the mythic atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or wasted sentences; the rhythm is controlled and propulsive through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting in key places, particularly with its central "symphony" metaphor. There's a high density of figurative language that occasionally slows momentum rather than sharpens it ("heard the wind's gusts as movements in a grand score, each note a molecule seeking its partner"). Some conceptual redundancy also appears, with the idea of the "empty chrysalis" being restated in several similar ways, creating minor prose loops.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, it suffers from a mild case of conceptual looping, with key phrases like "quantifying the absence" and "glimmering parole" repeated in a way that slightly diminishes their impact. The extremely high density of figurative language, while central to the style, occasionally risks blurring clarity rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can slightly dull momentum. There is a minor paraphrase loop in the description of the contagious remorse, which is stated twice in similar terms. While the line-level craft is strong, a more concise execution in a few key places would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains beautiful, inventive imagery but is hampered by significant text artifacts. There are prominent paraphrase loops and repetitive phrases ("empathetically decisive," "vigorous tender," "grain elevator talks," "borrowed starlight") that dull momentum and read like authorial tics. While the language is ambitious, this lack of concision and the density of figurative language in every paragraph verge on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    While individual sentences possess a poetic flair, the prose is hampered by significant structural repetition and conceptual looping. The repeated use of the story's key conceptual phrases ("archeologist of abandoned dreams" appears four times) creates a heavy-handed, template-like cadence that dulls momentum. This prose artifact prevents the otherwise ambitious language from achieving the clean, propulsive quality required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing. Key terms like "clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze," and "seeds of vigilance" are used four times each, creating a looping, mechanical rhythm that reads like a template. While the sentences are grammatically sound, these prominent text artifacts severely diminish the story's momentum and organic feel, marking a major flaw in line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but burdened by significant artifacts. There are numerous conceptual loops and redundancies (e.g., "symphonically minded," "empathy in motion," "create music in a silent world" are all repeated). The framing device "after the hedgehog uncurls" is used twice, feeling more like a forced structural tic than an organic element. Figurative language is over-stacked in places, leading to overwriting that dulls momentum rather than sharpens imagery ("chords of silence," "stitch silence").

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from significant conceptual looping. Key phrases—"hopeful melancholy," "eclipsed covenant," "basalt stone dent"—are repeated to the point of becoming incantations rather than fresh observations, which dulls momentum. This over-reliance on specific wording creates a scaffold-like effect that detracts from the otherwise strong line-level craft and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from severe overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, creating a high density that often smothers momentum and clarity ("...its iron ribs humming with unseen currents and its windows black as midnight parchment. Every tool hung like a note on a staff..."). This relentless ornamentation, while occasionally beautiful, ultimately reads as a stylistic tic that prioritizes decorative texture over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is crippled by extensive verbatim loops. Key phrases—"undercurrent of wisdom," "wildflower hush," "tide's thought"—are repeated multiple times, which severely dulls momentum and reads as textual scaffolding. This level of repetition is the story's most significant line-level flaw, creating a sense of mechanical construction over organic storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from a high density of figurative language, with nearly every sentence laden with metaphor or simile ("glimmered like translucent coral," "swayed like kelp," "glittered like emerald fire"). This consistent ornamentation verges on overwriting, slightly slowing the momentum and creating a texture that is rich but lacks rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong sensory details like the anemometer's "red needle trembling like a nervous heart." The primary weakness is a reliance on abstract, conceptual language ("singular convergence," "tapestry of future movement") that distances the reader from the concrete action. While there are no major line-level artifacts, this abstracting tendency prevents the prose from achieving a truly visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is lush but suffers from overwriting and repetition that dull its impact. There are multiple paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancies, such as the repeated phrase "through the colors of the aurora." The high density of figurative language sometimes becomes a stylistic tic rather than a precise tool, and the near-constant elevated register sacrifices momentum for texture, creating a sluggish pace.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic, but held back by minor, yet noticeable, flaws. The repetition of the striking phrase "avalanchingly quiet" diminishes its power, making it feel more like a tic than a singular, impactful image. There are also moments of near-redundancy ("distant rumble of distant storms") that could be tightened with a final editorial pass.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with a high information density per line. The sentence structure is varied and propulsive. The score is held just below the 9-band due to a very high concentration of figurative language that occasionally borders on overwriting and creates minor conceptual redundancies, such as restating the core idea of empathy being rearranged in slightly different terms in quick succession.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is evocative but marred by significant lexical repetition that creates a templated cadence. Key words like "germinate," "vibrate," "pulse," and "extend" are overused, and sentence structures often follow a "He [verbed]" pattern. This looping dulls the momentum and gives the piece an algorithmic feel, detracting from the otherwise strong imagery and preventing the line-level craft from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is periodically weighed down by abstract phrasing and overwriting that slows momentum. A generic platitude near the end ("every step forward is both a loss and a gain") is particularly jarring and detracts from the otherwise specific and carefully crafted language.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and repetition. The figurative language, while often beautiful, is so dense that it occasionally slows momentum. The repeated use of "stoically sparkling" becomes a noticeable tic rather than a meaningful refrain, and this artifact touches key moments, including the climax, dulling its unique impact. The line-level craft needs tightening to allow key images to land with more force.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, with high information density in its imagery. However, the piece is held back by noticeable prose artifacts, specifically paraphrase loops and repetitive phrasing. Phrases like "quietly determined," "bartered awakenings," and "between understanding and confusion" are reused in a way that feels like scaffolding, slightly dulling the momentum and polish of an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often elegant, but it suffers from overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can obscure rather than clarify. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile ("rivers of light," "pearls in a glass bottle," "ghost of data"), which lessens the impact of individual images and creates a uniform, somewhat breathless rhythm. While grammatically clean, the lack of stylistic variation dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates a strong command of imagery. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels self-conscious ("trapped sunrise," "ghostly light"). The repetition of the key phrase "luminescent ache" slightly dulls its impact, and the final paragraphs contain some conceptual redundancy that could be tightened for greater momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from excessive figurative density, where nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or personification (e.g., "sea sighed," "walls humming," "air quivered"). This overwriting slightly dulls the momentum and clarity in key moments. Additionally, a few phrases like "a paradox of joy and mourning" function as abstract labels rather than showing the state through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is lush but frequently overwritten, with a density of figurative language that slows momentum rather than enhancing it. There are minor paraphrase loops, such as restating the act of tracking sun trails in consecutive sentences. The repetition of key phrases like "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" feels more like adherence to a prompt than an organically developed motif.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is evocative but hampered by repetition and conceptual redundancy. Key phrases like "quantified sorrow" and "mundane miracles" are overused, creating a loop that dulls momentum. Some sentences paraphrase the content of previous ones, for instance, when describing the healing power of moonlight on both the sextant and the tower walls. These artifacts prevent the line-level craft from achieving the highest level of precision and economy.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is persistently overwritten, with figurative language and stacked descriptors in nearly every sentence, which ultimately dulls momentum and clarity. There are numerous paraphrase loops ("swaddle the world in music, wrapping its shadows") and a repetitive sentence structure built around "each [noun]," creating a templated cadence. These artifacts obscure the story's strong conceptual core under excessive ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with figurative language loading almost every sentence ("ink smeared like a secret sigh," "shelves curved like riverbanks"). This density can obscure rather than clarify, and a template cadence of descriptive clauses creates a monotonous rhythm. While grammatically clean, the piece lacks concision and propulsion, often favoring atmospheric description over advancing the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but overwritten. The high density of figurative language ("a weed as a confession," "time seemed to uncloak itself like a shy guest") occasionally muddles the imagery rather than sharpens it. There are several instances of template cadence and near-synonym restatement, such as the multiple uses of "tenuous absolution" and "heuristically gentle," which function as prose artifacts that dull momentum and feel like authorial scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is luminous and crafted with high information density. However, the sheer density of figurative language, while often beautiful, occasionally borders on overwriting, with metaphors stacked in nearly every sentence. A few phrases, such as "turning vapor into testimony," verge on restating the preceding idea, creating a minor drag on momentum in an otherwise propulsive and elegant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally vivid and concise, but it is marred by several text artifacts. Key descriptive phrases—"curiously steadfast" and "comforting unease"—are repeated verbatim, functioning as loops that feel like authorial tics rather than earned refrains. While the sentence-level craft is otherwise strong, these repetitive scaffolds dull the momentum and betray a lack of confidence in showing these states without labeling them.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    While many individual lines are poetic and striking, the prose suffers from an excessive density of figurative language. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, which cumulatively lessens the impact of the strongest images and approaches overwriting. A more restrained hand would have allowed key moments to resonate more powerfully against a plainer backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting. Figurative language is stacked too densely ("frozen starlight," "auroral sorrow," "mournful beauty," "melancholy light" all appear early), creating a texture that can feel ornate rather than precise. This density of abstract emotional descriptors occasionally obscures momentum and dilutes the impact of individual images, a significant hurdle for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is often beautiful, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, there are instances of overwriting where figurative language feels more decorative than functional. The final paragraph, in particular, shifts from showing to telling, using abstract thematic statements and scaffold-like phrases ("a reminder that," "a testament that") which dull the impact of the otherwise strong prose that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but is severely undermined by pervasive text-artifact issues, primarily paraphrase-loops and synonym churn. Phrases like "color of wonder," "symphonies of truth," and "glisten" are repeated excessively, dulling momentum and giving the piece a formulaic feel. This repetition goes beyond motif and becomes a significant drag on line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that often feels decorative rather than functional ("glinting like sunrise on sand," "mosaic of molten sky"). This saturation of poetic descriptors dulls the story’s momentum and clarity. There are also paraphrase loops, such as the repeated use of "fragmented wholeness," which weakens the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose contains evocative images, it suffers from repetition and redundancy that dull momentum. Phrases like "locked mailbox mystery" and "sandstorm calm" are overused, and several sentences exhibit paraphrase loops ("The mailbox...held a locked mailbox mystery"). This creates a scaffold-like quality, where the narrative restates its core components rather than allowing them to build through fresh language, measurably slowing the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from significant overwriting and repetitive syntactic structures. The density of figurative language is overwhelming, and a template cadence emerges from frequent "each [noun] a [noun]" constructions. This stylistic tic, along with paraphrase loops like "a pact with herself, a promise made in the dark," dulls the momentum and creates a layer of artifice that obscures the story's emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with vivid, specific language and a varied sentence rhythm that supports the story's pacing. The prose has high information density, with images often performing multiple functions. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraphs, where a few sentences shift from showing to a more declarative, summary style, slightly flattening the prose's momentum just before the close.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but suffers from repetition that creates minor loops. Key phrases like "smoothed hush" and "prophecy spoken in code" are repeated verbatim, dulling their impact. The high density of figurative language, while often beautiful, occasionally borders on being overwritten, slightly impeding momentum rather than consistently driving it.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, often beautiful, and demonstrates strong command of rhythm and imagery. However, the figurative density is relentless, with nearly every sentence containing a metaphor or simile. This creates a slightly overwritten texture that, while impressive, occasionally hinders momentum and gives the piece a uniform rather than dynamically varied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from severe overwriting and conceptual looping. Nearly every sentence is laden with dense, often repetitive figurative language. Key abstract concepts ("archive," "resonance structures," "ghostly resolve") are restated multiple times, creating synonym churn that stalls momentum. This density of abstract prose artifacts obscures the story's core action and dulls the impact of the closure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and repetition. Keywords like "calibrated," "unlink," and "unfinished" are used so frequently they lose impact and feel like scaffold. There are several instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea with different words, which slows momentum (e.g., "The pearl twilight deepened, turning the sanctuary's light into a silvery haze").

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting that borders on purple prose. Figurative language is stacked so densely in places that it blurs clarity, such as the mixed metaphor "sharpening the hue of her song." This relentless elevation can dull momentum and creates a barrier to emotional immediacy, a significant flaw for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting. Figurative language is so dense—appearing in nearly every sentence—that it occasionally muddles clarity and slows momentum ("ice filaments through a loom of memory," "choir of quiet light"). While evocative, this relentless density creates a monotonous texture and lacks the syntactic variety needed to modulate tension effectively, especially during moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.5)
    While often elegant, the prose is severely hampered by overwriting and repetitive text artifacts. Key phrases ("demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber," "moon paths") are recycled to the point of becoming distracting tics. This, combined with paraphrase loops that restate the central idea of "hidden patterns" in slightly different terms, creates significant drag on momentum and undermines the story's otherwise strong aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear but weakened by repetition and summary. Key phrases like "comfortable lies" and "excavate truth" are recycled, creating a scaffold-like feel. The final two paragraphs shift into a summary that flattens the narrative momentum, telling the reader about the resolution's impact rather than showing it through a final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is often stunning in its rhythm and imagery, it suffers from a pattern of conceptual looping. Key thematic phrases—"variant allegiance," "fragmented radio frequencies," "ancient shadows," "gritty whimsy"—are repeated to the point of becoming incantatory scaffolding rather than evolving motifs. This repetition, particularly of "gritty whimsy," measurably dulls the momentum and gives parts of the text a slightly mechanical feel, despite the high quality of the individual sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from an excessive density of figurative language, with nearly every sentence containing a simile or metaphor ("billowing like a sigh," "dance like tiny planets," "glowing like amber," "like luminous ribbons"). This overwriting flattens the rhythm and can dull the impact of individual images. There are also minor conceptual loops around the ideas of being a "bridge" or "translator," which could be consolidated for greater momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is ambitious but frequently overwrought, impeding momentum with excessive adjectival density. Figurative language is often mixed or clunky, as seen in "a fleshly ethereal glow," which muddles the imagery. While many descriptions are evocative, the piece would benefit from greater concision and trusting stronger verbs over stacked modifiers to carry the narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is hampered by overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains figurative language, creating a density that occasionally blurs meaning rather than sharpening it. This relentless metaphor ("glowed like a memory of storms," "sang a thin, glassy hymn," "tide of a distant sea") slightly dulls the story's momentum and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often effective, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, it suffers from a pattern of conceptual redundancy. Key terms and ideas ("reverberate," "entangled," "controlling influence") are repeated to a degree that dulls their impact, creating a loop-like effect. This thematic insistence slows momentum and can feel like scaffolding, where the author is ensuring the reader understands the point rather than trusting the dramatization to carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose demonstrates ambition but is marred by noticeable repetition and text artifacts. Phrases like "vibrant hush," "In the calm before realization," and "By the way light breaks through storm clouds" are looped, creating a template-like cadence that dulls momentum. This reduces the prose's propulsion and gives key moments a feeling of being constructed from a kit of parts rather than flowing naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and rhythmic, creating a rich texture that supports the story's accumulative drive. While the figurative language is largely brilliant, a few minor instances of paraphrase-loops appear early on (e.g., "yearning algorithm—a self-editing code of longing"). This very slight redundancy prevents a perfect score, but the overall propulsion, clarity, and sentence-level craft are of an extremely high caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates high information density. Lines like "the hum of forgotten data like a distant choir" are excellent. However, a few moments lean toward summary, such as stating "Lia felt a surge of purpose" rather than showing it through action or perception. This slight tendency to narrate internal shifts prevents a higher score, but the line-level craft remains very strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is overwrought in places, with a high density of figurative language that can blunt momentum. There are instances of near-repetition and conceptual loops, such as the multiple references to the lighthouse's rhythm. The reliance on explaining effects ("casting a golden aura," "causing the...floes to shimmer") in the climax tells more than it shows, slightly weakening the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains beautiful, striking images but is hampered by overwriting and repetition. Figurative language is occasionally stacked too densely, and conceptual loops appear, such as the multiple mentions of "gripping reality loosely." These prose artifacts, while not destroying clarity, create a sense of authorial effort that slightly dulls the narrative momentum and the immediacy of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is burdened by significant text artifacts, primarily paraphrase loops and template-cadence repetition. Key phrases are repeated verbatim across paragraphs, severely damaging momentum and creating a sense of overwriting. For instance, the exact phrase "nurture intersubjective understanding" appears twice, functioning as scaffolding rather than organic prose and dulling the story's emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, resonant imagery. However, there is a slight tendency toward overwriting through the use of curated, abstract neologisms like "whisperfield calm," which, while atmospheric, can feel more like labels than organic descriptions. Some sentences carry a similar stately rhythm, creating a minor template-cadence effect that slightly dulls the propulsion in places.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it leans heavily on dense, adjectival descriptions and a string of familiar similes ("swirled like whispered secrets," "tears fell like dew," "surge like a tide"). This creates a lush texture but occasionally slows the momentum and feels overwritten. While there are no major grammatical errors or loops, a greater degree of concision would have sharpened its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is hampered by moments of overwriting that reduce clarity and momentum. The synesthetic image of "sonically reflective shards of light" is conceptually muddled, and other abstract phrases slow the reader. While the sentence structure is varied, the high density of figurative language sometimes feels like a decorative layer rather than an integrated part of the narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless density of figurative language verges on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, which sometimes lessens the impact of individual images and creates a uniform, highly stylized texture that feels slightly labored. While the language is clear and grammatically sound, a more judicious use of metaphor in high-pressure moments would allow the strongest images to resonate more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its relentless density of figurative language ("radiant sigh," "filament of starlight," "yearning to break free") occasionally feels overwritten, slightly dulling the momentum. While many images are powerful, their sheer concentration in every paragraph borders on excessive. The piece is strong but would be even stronger with more moments of plainspoken clarity to provide contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness due to persistent overwriting. Figurative language is stacked to the point of becoming opaque (e.g., "each fragment held a note of the scent of hope"). Redundant phrases and abstract emotional labels ("pulsing stillness," "quiet duty," "quiet acceptance") recur, dulling momentum and clarity rather than enhancing them.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, with a steady rhythm and good clarity. However, it is held back from excellence by occasional moments of summary that replace dramatization, particularly when explaining the key's function. This slightly reduces momentum and information density in a crucial beat, preventing the line-level craft from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The primary weakness is the significant repetition of key phrases, which functions as a prose artifact. Phrases like "shrewdly innocent" and "cleft in certainty" are used like boilerplate, creating conceptual loops that dull the momentum rather than deepening the meaning with each recurrence. This textual churn prevents the otherwise strong line-level craft from achieving true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and redundancy that dull its momentum. The phrase "reflectively vibrant" is repeated three times, becoming a noticeable echo. Several sentences tell rather than show ("The act of weighing was not literal but a meditation..."), and the density of figurative language sometimes clouds meaning. These line-level artifacts, particularly the synonym churn and scaffolding, would require a firm editorial hand to achieve publishable clarity and concision.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from overwriting and repetitive artifacts. The constant recycling of "honeyed hush" is a significant loop that dulls its impact with each appearance. The figurative language is dense, sometimes creating a cloying effect that slows momentum rather than sharpens the image, particularly in moments that call for precision over lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.5)
    While individual sentences are often elegant, the piece is critically undermined by pervasive prose artifacts. There are numerous instances of looped phrasing ("feral nexus," "lucidly watchful," "swirling hush," "spiral seashell fragment") that are repeated verbatim. This repetition feels mechanical rather than lyrical, creating a template-like cadence that severely damages momentum and reads like an unedited response to a prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative figurative language. However, it occasionally borders on being overwritten, with sentences so dense with modifiers that they slightly slow the momentum. The final paragraph, in particular, feels like a summary that restates the resolution beat, creating a minor paraphrase loop that could have been cut to end on a stronger, more immediate image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that approaches overwriting. Nearly every sentence strains for poetic effect, which can dull momentum and obscure the core action in a haze of metaphor. Several concepts, like "moving stillness" and "translating heartbeats," are circled and restated, creating conceptual loops instead of forward propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    While ambitious and grammatically clean, the prose suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwritten. Phrases like "a chorus that seemed to ripple outward like a tide of whispers" stack metaphors in a way that blurs rather than sharpens the image. This tendency towards abstraction and poetic density, while consistent, is the story's most significant flaw, hindering its claim to flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, it suffers from overwriting; the relentless cascade of figurative language in nearly every sentence creates a texture so thick it occasionally risks obscuring the action beneath it. While the piece teaches this pattern, the sheer density, particularly in the description of the final transmutation, requires a deduction for lacking concision and propulsion in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting. The density of figurative language is relentless ("silver veins," "tamer's whip," "lion's tail"), creating a texture that can feel overwrought rather than sharp. The piece would be stronger with more concision and trust in simpler, more direct images to carry the emotional weight, especially during key actions.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, its primary flaw is a relentless density of figurative language; nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile. This overwriting dulls the rhythm and momentum, violating the principle of selective detail and creating a texture that feels slightly labored rather than effortlessly sharp. For example, the opening paragraph alone stacks multiple complex figures, slightly impeding immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting, with dense figurative language in almost every sentence that slows momentum and occasionally obscures concrete action. There are numerous instances of conceptual loops and redundant phrasing ("unfinished plans and forgotten promises," multiple mentions of "maze of intentions"). This stylistic density, while ambitious, ultimately creates a turgid rhythm and detracts from clarity, especially during moments of action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but critically flawed by repetition and a significant copy-editing error. The phrase "excruciatingly gentle" is used five times, becoming a distracting artifact. More damagingly, the sentence "He recalled the night he first imagined the memory‑counting clock, a night when rain hammered the roof and the scent of wet earth filled his room" is duplicated back-to-back, which completely breaks momentum and signals a lack of polish disqualifying it from publication.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant scaffolding and paraphrase loops, with core concepts restated in adjacent sentences using slightly different wording. This creates a sluggish rhythm and reduces information density. Overwriting is also an issue, with many sentences laden with figurative language that adds more weight than meaning, ultimately obscuring the story's momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, the density of figurative language is exceptionally high, with nearly every sentence containing a simile or metaphor. While individually effective, this relentless layering approaches overwriting and creates a uniform texture that slightly dulls the impact of key moments. A more varied prose rhythm, with some plainer sentences for contrast, would heighten the power of the most crucial images.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from significant overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, creating a relentless density that blurs imagery and slows momentum ("damp amber," "latitude of grief," "bruised violet"). This stylistic tic, a form of prose artifact, detracts from the clarity and impact of key moments, making the craft feel more performative than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative imagery and a confident rhythm. The primary weakness is a cluster of conceptual loops and redundant phrasing in the final two paragraphs, which dulls the impact of the closure. The repetition of key phrases ("bitterly sweet," "quaking reverie") and the pile-up of summary statements ("a testament," "a reminder," "a beacon") create drag where the story should be at its sharpest.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is lush but suffers from overwriting; nearly every sentence is laden with figurative language, which dulls the impact and slows momentum. There are several instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same concept with slightly different wording. While often beautiful line-by-line, the cumulative effect is a lack of concision and rhythmic variety, especially in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from overwriting, with a high density of adjectives that sometimes feels decorative rather than functional ("luminous skeptic," "kaleidoscopic prayers," "realistically imaginative spirit"). This density, combined with a few abstract conceptual labels, occasionally slows momentum and reduces clarity. The story would be stronger with more selective and impactful figurative language, particularly in the moments of highest tension.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    While often beautiful, the prose is hampered by recurring artifacts that detract from its overall polish. There are paraphrase loops (e.g., describing the pings as a "beacon for wandering souls" and later as "guidance to any wanderer"). A template cadence appears in a sequence of "She [verb]..." sentences, and the key phrase "troubling serenity" is repeated verbatim, slightly dulling its impact. These issues of repetition prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is frequently beautiful, marked by inventive figurative language. However, its relentless density verges on overwriting, with metaphors layered so thickly that they occasionally diminish momentum. The repetition of the key phrase "thundering calm" is a noticeable prose artifact that slightly mars an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative but is marred by overwriting and redundancy. There are paraphrase loops ("inscriptions... had become conduits, their messages emerging...") and synonym churn around key concepts like repair and balance. While individual images are strong, the density of figurative language and abstract nouns weighs down the momentum, particularly in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose contains moments of genuine beauty and precision. However, it is hampered by noticeable text artifacts, particularly synonym loops and redundancy. The line "The garden's silence was a velveteen gloom, a soft darkness that wrapped each stone in a quiet velvet coat" restates the same idea three times, and key phrases like "uncharted echoes" are repeated without development, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but leans heavily on abstraction and conceptual summary ("laboratory of possibility," "inscribed outcomes onto the world’s fabric"). This intellectualizing keeps the reader at a distance from the action. While grammatically sound, the sentences often prioritize explaining the idea behind the story over immersing the reader within it, resulting in a loss of momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.0)
    While often vivid, the prose suffers from overwriting and repetitive artifacts. The density of similes becomes predictable, and key phrases like "thistled calm" and "secretly luminous" are repeated verbatim, feeling more like mandated keywords than organic choices. This lexical looping weighs down the narrative momentum and gives the prose a constructed quality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    While often lyrical and evocative, the prose suffers from two distinct artifacts. There is a noticeable template cadence ("She wore... She lifted... She whispered..."), which creates a ritualistic but slightly mechanical rhythm. More critically, the line "Through the veil of incomplete information, she sensed..." is a near-paraphrase of an earlier line, creating a loop that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, but it occasionally becomes heavy with abstraction and conceptual density, slowing momentum. There are minor instances of paraphrase loops, where a concept is stated and then immediately rephrased in slightly different terms (e.g., explaining the "rationally rebellious" paradox). The final paragraphs, while thematically important, lean more towards essayistic summary than sharp, imagistic storytelling, slightly dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing and template cadence, which feels artificial. Key words from the prompt ("denote," "velvet," "vanishing arts," "expectantly resigned") are used multiple times, creating distracting loops that read like a checklist. This overwriting and lexical illusion, especially the awkward phrasing of "across unlearning hatred," severely damages momentum and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a pervasive density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, which can bog down the narrative momentum and feel effortful. This is particularly noticeable in lines that stack concepts, such as explaining synaptic plasticity and then immediately applying it to plants. The piece would be stronger with more restraint, allowing the most powerful images to land with greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clean but leans on overwriting in its attempt at lyricism, with phrases like "nectar dusk" and "electric nectar" feeling more decorative than precise. There are moments of scaffolding where the narration summarizes causality, such as "The reveal of the echo’s source allowed her to fulfill her motivation," which stalls momentum. The figurative language is dense but not always sharp, slightly blurring the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting. Figurative language is deployed with such high density that it occasionally blurs meaning and feels labored, an artifact of its style. Sentences are well-constructed, but the relentless cascade of metaphors and similes ("salty lullaby," "amber halos," "lazy thoughts," "hushed blaze") creates a textural monotony that dampens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is critically flawed by pervasive repetition and paraphrase loops. Key actions and concepts like "threading a filament of memory," "cascading revelations," and "incisively kind" are restated with only minor variation, stalling momentum and giving the text a mechanical, overwrought quality that dulls the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong imagery like the "wounded star." However, it is hampered by minor but noticeable artifacts, including a tendency to summarize key intellectual breakthroughs ("He incorporated that failure into his proofs, showing that..."). There are also moments of slight overwriting and repetitive sentence structures that slightly blunt the narrative's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often beautiful, the prose is hampered by repetitive syntactic structures, a notable prose artifact. The frequent use of the "each [noun] a [noun phrase]" template ("each brushstroke a quiet promise," "each hue a patient hymn," "each line traced the curvature") creates a mechanical cadence that dulls the momentum. This template-cadence run, combined with a very high density of figurative language, makes the prose feel overwritten in places, sacrificing clarity for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it borders on being overwritten; the figurative language is so pervasive that it occasionally lessens the impact of key moments through sheer density. While there are no major technical flaws like loops or scaffolds, a more restrained hand would have allowed the most powerful images to land with even greater force. The line-level craft is strong but lacks the concision and momentum of truly exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose demonstrates ambition with its rich figurative language, but it frequently tips into overwriting, with dense sentences that slow momentum. The final paragraphs suffer from scaffolding and conceptual redundancy, particularly in the lines that explain the story's theme and the character's learning process. For example, the adjacent thoughts "He felt the weight of destiny lift" and "He could finally step beyond fate's design" are a paraphrase loop that weakens the climactic beat's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, with figurative language layered so densely that it often dulls momentum rather than sharpens imagery. There are multiple instances of synonym churn and repetitive phrasing ("lingering luminance," "repulsive allure," the funhouse "inhales" twice) that create prose artifacts. This stylistic excess obscures the narrative's strong conceptual core.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, it suffers from several prose artifacts, primarily conceptual loops. Key phrases like "restless euphony" and "sketched resonance" are repeated verbatim, functioning more as labels than evolving descriptions. This repetition, combined with the slightly overwrought density of figurative language, creates moments where the prose calls attention to its own mechanics rather than immersing the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with a strong, varied rhythm. However, its high level of figurative density is relentless, occasionally feeling overwrought and slowing momentum, especially in moments of abstraction like "a gold that felt both hopeful and foreboding." A few minor scaffolding phrases slightly dilute the otherwise high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from overwriting, with nearly every sentence laden with a simile or metaphor ("swirling like moonlit water," "settle like dust," "danced like glass fragments"). This high density of figurative language creates a monotonous rhythm and dulls the impact of individual images. There is also conceptual redundancy, particularly with the repeated phrase "pit of lies," which feels like a scaffold rather than an organic element by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often beautiful and evocative, it suffers from overwriting and repetition that borders on artifact. Key phrases from the prompt (e.g., "interlaced absence," "hush of the... blaze") are repeated to the point of diminishing returns, creating a heavy-handed lyrical effect. The sheer density of figurative language, especially in the final third, begins to feel strenuous rather than elegant, slightly dulling the story's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.3)
    While often clear and evocative, the prose is severely hampered by text-artifact loops. Key phrases—"reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve," "antique ink stamp," "tranquilly perceptive," "honest origins"—are repeated so frequently that they drain the language of its power and create a template-like cadence. This repetition measurably dulls the story's momentum and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically dense, with many stunning lines like "glass envelope thin as a sigh." However, a few moments of over-articulation slightly mar the craft, such as "an olfactory reminder of his torment," which labels a feeling instead of letting the sensory detail do the work alone. This tendency to explain the emotional subtext, while infrequent, momentarily dilutes the otherwise powerful "show, don't tell" execution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and repetition that dulls momentum. Figurative language is stacked in nearly every sentence, creating a turgid rhythm. Key phrases like "intangibly tangible" and "unfiltered awakening" are repeated verbatim, functioning as conceptual labels rather than evolving images. This density and looping create prose artifacts that obscure clarity at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is compromised by significant overwriting and repetitive artifacts. Key phrases ("brilliant dimness," "missing pieces," "star trails") are looped to the point of diminishing returns, functioning as thematic labels rather than evolving motifs. Sentences are often dense with abstract concepts that obscure the simple physical actions occurring, resulting in a sluggish momentum and a lack of clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often lyrical, the prose suffers from overwriting and redundancy. There's a high density of figurative language that sometimes slows momentum, but the more significant issue is paraphrase-looping. Several adjacent sentences restate the protagonist's motivation to "quell" his conscience or confront his lies, creating a feeling of narrative stalling rather than propulsion. This repetition dulls the impact of an otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops, which dull momentum and clarity. Key phrases like "furrowed hush," "untethered," and the "antique drawer pull" are repeated to the point of becoming text artifacts. This lexical repetition, especially the recycling of "furrowed hush" for both the voice and the heart, creates a template-like cadence that undermines the intended lyrical effect and reads as overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that ultimately dulls its own impact. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile ("trembling gold," "forgotten constellations," "tidal wave of what-ifs," "pen across paper"), resulting in overwriting that smothers the scene's momentum. While individually eloquent, the cumulative effect is a lack of rhythmic variety and a prose texture that feels labored rather than effortlessly evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often evocative, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from several instances of redundancy and looping. The phrase "delicately robust" is repeated in a way that feels forced. The final paragraph contains multiple sentences that paraphrase the same core idea ("past as a map," "past could serve as a compass"), which dulls the impact and slows the momentum of the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with potent imagery like "the air curled like a filament of starlight." Momentum is well-maintained through varied sentence structures. The primary flaw is a slight over-reliance on key phrases ("paradoxically steady," "reluctant metamorphosis") which become noticeable upon repetition. Additionally, some abstract language in the final paragraph ("cosmic intimacy," "celestial fire") feels less concrete than the powerful sensory details that precede it, slightly dulling the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that verges on overwriting, slightly fatiguing the reader. Furthermore, the key phrase "choking beauty" is repeated three times, which stands out as a significant line-level flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong, memorable images like "photons like mournful fireflies." However, there are moments of slight redundancy and telling that disrupt the momentum. For instance, "Kwan Yin's tear glimmered with a faint shimmer... These shimmery images were the method" is a minor paraphrase loop, and stating "The shadow work was not merely a repair; it was an unveiling" explains a concept that the action already implies.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting and repetition. The density of figurative language is very high, and key phrases like "vibrant hush" are repeated to the point of becoming a tic. This creates a pleasing surface texture but occasionally stalls momentum and reveals the authorial scaffolding holding the mood in place, reducing the story's overall propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but overwrought, suffering from repetitive phrasing and text-loop artifacts. The recurring use of "calmly inventive" and "winking hush" creates a template cadence that dulls momentum. Sentences are often burdened by stacked modifiers and figurative language, which, while occasionally beautiful, collectively slow the pace and obscure the action, particularly in the tacked-on final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and rich, but its density borders on being overwritten, with figurative language in nearly every sentence. There are also minor paraphrase loops and a heavy repetition of key thematic phrases ("lingering promise," "borrowed dawn"). While stylistic, this patterning slightly reduces propulsion and creates moments of redundancy rather than purely accumulative power.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and contains striking images, but it suffers from overwriting and conceptual density. Figurative language is stacked heavily throughout, and key phrases ("furiously tranquil," "cartography of scars") are repeated to the point of becoming jargon. This density, while tonally consistent, often smothers the action and momentum, creating a feeling of beautiful stasis rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but suffers from overwriting and conceptual looping. Phrases like "dignified chaos" and "turn questions into destinations" are restated, and the density of abstract figurative language often slows momentum. Several sentences summarize internal processes rather than showing them, such as "translating abstract questions into concrete pathways, exactly as they intended," which reads as scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often beautiful, its high figurative density sometimes slows momentum, creating a series of static images rather than propulsive action. There's a risk of overwriting, with nearly every sentence containing a simile or metaphor. The repetition of the phrase "as the moon cleared the skyline" functions as a structural anchor but borders on a prose loop.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and a varied, poetic rhythm that propels the abstract narrative forward. Figurative language is inventive and consistent ("leaves shimmering like silver rain," "auditorium of clouds"), managing to be lush without becoming overwrought. The line-level execution is clean, precise, and free of distracting artifacts, showcasing a high degree of control.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and ambitious, with strong, specific imagery. However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, occasionally verging on being overwritten and slightly impeding momentum. While there are no clear artifacts like loops, a more varied textural rhythm would elevate the piece from very strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, with nearly every sentence burdened by a simile or metaphor, creating a dense, sluggish texture that hampers momentum. This stylistic choice violates the principle of economy, as the relentless figurative language feels more decorative than functional and flattens the story's dynamics. Phrases are also looped ("rhythmically placid," "patient cadence"), constituting a prose artifact that detracts from publishability at a high level.

Clarity holds with clean grammar, yet template cadence in "she felt... she whispered... she extended" run reduces propulsion by -0.4. Final line resolves with resonant image, but artifacts touch closure faintly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is concise with high density, each sentence advancing atmosphere and arc through vivid images like "spilling tiny shards that sang like wind-chimes," varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, with metaphors like crack as sorrow map cohering without muddle, propelling momentum in peak beats like the staircase ascent. Clarity shines in sequence and grammar, with strong verbs and specific nouns; opening anchors voice, final line recharges motifs. Minor register drift in elevated diction like "harmonic tide" slightly jars in one spot, but no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose has high density with vivid images like "mournful fireflies," but figurative overload in peak beats mixes metaphors (e.g., "sunrise on a blackened sea") and creates minor opacity; rhythm varies, yet paraphrase loops like repeated "shimmer" dull momentum without payoff, though clarity holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose has high density and rhythmic variety, with strong verbs like "skittered" advancing atmosphere, but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating hush vibrancy) and mixed metaphors (captive constellations to miniature comets) dull some beats. Clarity is maintained, though figurative overload in the sparks cascade touches momentum without harming closure. No major artifacts in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose advances atmosphere through dense, purposeful imagery like "winking hush" and "phosphorescent pulse," with varied rhythm and high density, but occasional overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., fireflies, constellations, moss) muddles peak beats without payoff. No major loops or artifacts obscure closure, though synonym churn in "quiet intrigue" repetitions dulls momentum slightly. Clarity strong, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like violet ribbons, but repetitive phrasing ("lingering promise" in multiple sentences) creates minor paraphrase loops that dull momentum without obscuring closure.

No major artifacts touch the final image, keeping propulsion strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves high density with sentences advancing atmosphere and theme, varying rhythm naturally in storm descriptions without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like clouds churning as ink on parchment is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the timer's ring. Minor synonym churn in scar metaphors noted, but propulsion remains clear with strong verbs and concise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose features high figurative density with mixed metaphors like "constellations on a midnight map" and "vector for the forthcoming fence," creating some muddle in peak beats without pattern payoff, triggering a -0.6 deduction; paraphrase loops appear in repetitive stems around "hidden overture" and "dignified chaos," dulling momentum but not obscuring closure. Rhythm varies with purposeful paragraphing, and sentences propel via image accumulation, but synonym churn (e.g., "fence diplomatically fierce") and template cadence in duel descriptions reduce density. Opening anchors voice strongly, but final line resolves generically without recharging motifs sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose propels with high density in metaphors like "veins of light" and varied rhythm, avoiding loops; sentences advance atmosphere and theme without scaffold. Figurative language is coherent but dense in peak beats, occasionally muddling clarity without harming closure. No major artifacts, though some synonym churn in "rusted" repetitions feels slightly templated.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose has rhythmic variety and density, with lines like "leaves shimmering like silver rain" advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "broken anniversary clock" descriptions) and template cadence in ascent beats dull momentum without payoff. Figurative language muddles in peak moments, like "tide of clouds swelled" mixing metaphors without clarity harm at closure. Information propulsion strong in imagery, but minor scaffold in redundant "flickering compasses" echoes triggers artifact penalty. Quick test fails: loops present, though density high and no muddle in final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is concise with high density, sentences advancing atmosphere and character through vivid images like lanterns flickering like questions; rhythm varies naturally, though some figurative density in dream fragments borders on overwriting without muddle. No loops or scaffolds, with strong verbs and specific nouns propelling momentum; final line resolves by recharging the seed motif effectively. Minor register drift in phrases like "empirically whimsical mind" slightly jars but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, like repeated "tides of remembrance" and "rhythmically placid," dulling momentum without propulsion; figurative density muddles peak moments, such as the compass's glow, triggering artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences multi-task—description nudges motive, motion cues emotion. Density high, loops rare (“whispered” appears twice, quickly forgiven). Final cadence—door “dissolved into a ripple of air”—is clean, memorable. No muddled metaphors or paraphrase loops. One micro-repeat (“fables of absence” phrase) nudges from flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with the cavern soundscape; sentences expand and contract without filler. Occasional stacked modifiers “gently luminous glow that spread like a calm tide” verge on lush but pay off in closure imagery. No redundancies, zero filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates without template echo; parallel tactile verbs (“echoed,” “shivered,” “sang”) serve patterned musicality rather than loop. High density lines—“spiral of crystal that rose into clouds. Each step resonated with a note of memory…”—advance goal, memory, theme simultaneously. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. One slipped abstract compound “future stretched like endless circuitry” slips under the elegance ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is luminous, propulsive, varied sentence length under music. Zero loop or synonym stall; each phrase advances image or pressure. Occasional ornate phrasing (“eloquently silent”) repeated deliberately to thematic purpose. No clarity break at closure; diction supports intensifying beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and purposeful; nearly no loops. Minor overwritten lines near the frost-kiss cost a hair: “stitched the night into a tapestry” is one mixed thread shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose ear test passes: rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings switch. A few adjacent lines share syntactic templates (“when,” “as”) flagged under template-cadence, yet the effect reads intentional musical recursion rather than unconscious loop—score dock stays within bounds. Figurative language dense but purposeful; no mixed metaphors at closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density, zero loops. Figurative language is selective—“shattered marquee flapped like a tired animal” earns its keep. Syntax accelerates during ladder climb, breathes during ledger reveal. No mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “weightless burden” repeated twice could trim once.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Paragraph rhythms vary, sentences carry double duty (e.g., “Basilica quivers… aligning like constellations”). Figurative language patterned, minor over-densities (“luminous torment” reused twice) do not cloud closure. No scaffold loops detected; props track cleanly. Punctuation consistent, syntax clear under pressure. No homophone errors.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm controlled via breath-length sentences and caesura; zero scaffolding, vivid verb-noun pairings “circuit breakers hissed like dying beasts” drive momentum. Metaphoric density never occludes causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)

    Prose is dense and poetic; occasional stacked metaphors (“chorus of old testimonies,” “tide of remorse”) risk overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; rhythm serves the elegiac tone.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is compressed, atmospheric, rhythm varied, if occasionally velveted: “storm-worn, windblown” feels stacked but earns its cadence. “Furrowed hush” returns thrice—not lazily, each instance recharged. Minor figurative muddle (“moon marked schedule”) but never at closure. Near-zero scaffolding; density high.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“pen across paper,” “liquid glass”) risk overwriting yet stay legible. No loops or scaffold; momentum sustained. One mixed metaphor—“regrets dissolve into light”—is borderline but occurs in a reflective beat, not peak action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers scent, light, and emotion. One minor loop—“luminous grove… luminous canopy”—is the only detectable repetition. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. Closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is musical and information-dense, yet figurative layering sometimes obscures action (“velvet”/“silk”/“nebula” in three sentences). No paraphrase loops, but stacked metaphors in peak beats dull clarity. Rhythm modulates well with emotional crests.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; metaphors cohere (tear as needle, veil as fabric). No loops or scaffold detected. A few near-abstractions—“impossible physics whispered through her bones”—are earned by context. Final image is crystalline and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“smoldering amber,” “velvet black,” “midnight oil”) flirt with overwriting but serve the Accumulative mode. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Strong verbs and sensory nouns keep momentum; final image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-zero scaffolding; "fractured beams highlighting slow decay" compresses setting/theme. Minor abstraction in "kindled humility" (word 150) is redeemed by embodied context. Final line’s cadence ("scarred yet hopeful, mirrored her own journey") avoids cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "scorched testament" metaphor evolves meaningfully. Deduction for "drifting resonance" repetition (4x), muddying peak beats. Final line ("glimmered like molten glass") avoids overwriting—textural specificity elevates without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "crimson for fear, azure for longing" serves multiple functions; final beat ("tune... lingered") maintains clarity while charging closure with poetic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with varied sentence rhythms, but "chased stillness" repeats identically at 60% and 80% marks. Minor paraphrase loop ("impossible spaces") prevents 9.0 despite exceptional density in light-pulse sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold: "gently persistent" label repeats without showing tradeoffs (Q9D). "Amplified quiet" overused (6x), bordering on template cadence. Final line's "faded into memory" slightly muddles closure image, but lyrical density and clean syntax elevate execution despite artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops with high density ("chest expand like a lantern" fuses physiology/theme), but minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("silver pollen" slightly decorative); no artifacts dull closure's "foggy lucidity" charge.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("vaporous threads that stitched the present to the past"). Figurative language ("Möbius strip of foliage") enhances clarity without muddle. Final line ("endless discovery") recharges opening motifs flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "rusted cathedral" and "forged from unexpected tools" achieve crystalline density. Final line "sowing resilience where only dust had lived" recharges motif with propulsion, no figurative muddle even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "ashen forge emitted sparks that fell like rain" achieves high density without muddle. Minor register drift in "resonant reconfiguration" metaphor but stays voice-coherent. Final line’s "soft crack of trust rejoined" avoids cliché through precise sonic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    Adjacent paraphrase loops: "painting the sky in whispers" followed by "moved like liquid dusk" restates atmosphere. Template cadence in high-pressure beats ("Lira gently pressed... Lira felt... Lira arranged"). Overwritten metaphors ("moonbeams that danced like liquid silver ribbons. Each photon seemed to remember...") blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong textural specificity ("creases catching a sliver of sunrise") but scaffold issues: "weighty lightness" repeats 4x, and template cadence in task narration ("I lift... I breathe...") creates minor loops. No figurative muddle in peak beats, though "frozen veins opened like veins of glass" strains cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dense figurative language ("spilling a single silver thread that unspooled into a scroll") muddles the pivotal decoding sequence, triggering tightened penalties for coherence in a high-pressure beat despite strong opening texture.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero closure artifacts but mid-story paraphrase loops ("gale curled... rattling battlements" then "storm intensified... rain lashing") and one strained metaphor ("whispering equations"). Prevents 9+ eligibility per global rules.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor scaffold in "remarkably composed" repetition and slight overwriting ("pale shards of light") prevent 9.0. But "each droplet fell like a tiny comet" exemplifies high-density propulsion, and the final chime image avoids closure muddle with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose flows with high density, but adjacent synonym loops ("ambiguously clear" ×5) and stock metaphors ("sigh of a city") trigger −0.4 penalty; final image remains clear despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor scaffold in high-pressure beats: "The act was not mere cleaning but a ritual..." states when showing suffices. Figurative density ("blooming withering symphony") risks muddle but pays off in closure. Strong propulsion otherwise—sentences vary rhythm to match polishing cadence without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong rhythm in climax ("amber arcs... illuminating chambers") but synonym loops ("soft, otherworldly glow" → "soft glow" later) and repetitive "subdued awakenings" reduce density. "Mechanically warm" lacks functional connection to lever mechanics. Final image clarity preserved despite minor scaffold in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "water ripples on the floor responded" avoids filter verbs while advancing plot. Minor density dip in opening ("trembling" x2) deducts 0.3, but payoff justifies it—climax avoids figurative muddle with visceral clarity ("lanterns steadied, their light no longer trembling").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; “peripherally aware” slightly jars as corporate diction but fits oracle POV. Final beat (“weight seemed to lift”) achieves high density without muddle, though “swaying certainties” repetition edges toward scaffold in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Minor scaffold in synonym loops ("drowsy alertness" variations) and mixed metaphor ("frozen syllables" vs. "emotional tonnage") reduce clarity in peak beats. No closure-damaging artifacts, but filter-verb stacks ("feeling the pulse," "letting quiet settle") impede propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("silence grew louder, regenerative and warm") slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short phrases during descent: "He burrowed deeper"). Final line’s "promise kept" avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops and high density propel the prose, yet "cautious exuberance" recurs with near-synonym phrasing ("mixture of awe," "trembling smiles"), creating subtle scaffold in peak beats that prevents 9+ despite lyrical control.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion; minor scaffold in "breathing in the smell... feeling the page tremble" slightly dilutes momentum. Final line crystallizes theme without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Overwritten cadence ("spycraft microdot film specs, the tiny reels of captured reality") creates synonym loops in peak beats; final paragraph’s stacked modifiers ("inexplicable feeling... subtly rewired") dull closure’s propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold in adjacent metaphors ("rhetorical devices that dripped like honey," "each phrase was a mirror") slightly muddles high-pressure beats. Otherwise, vivid propulsion: "sound looped back upon itself" crystallizes tension with zero redundancy in closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("wave travelled through glass, ice, lake" does triple duty). "Upended hush" repetition triggers -0.2 paraphrase loop penalty. Final beat crystalline: "shimmering with color, each ripple a note" avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Near-paraphrase loop in climax ("darkening brightness... somber sunrise, the darkening brightness") triggers -0.4 artifact penalty. Otherwise strong propulsion: "tablet dissolved into particles of light" avoids thematic echo through concrete image. No metaphoric muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "invisible ribbons" metaphor sustains without muddling. Every sentence propels: "pressure pressed against filament, stretching it like taut rope of feeling." Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete action ("rewound and healed").

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsion but "layered tranquility" repetition creates subtle synonym loop. "Pulse in her own chest" metaphor borders on cliché yet avoids full artifact penalty through context.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush yet controlled ("vapor curled around dead petals, filament catching UV glow"), but "collage of moments" phrasing risks thematic echo. Near-closure density stumbles: "delicate dance of memory and scent" verges on cliché, slightly dulling the final image’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose achieves high density with lyrical propulsion ("shadows painted ancient murals"), but stacked metaphors in peak beats ("soft, grainy, humming with residual energy") slightly blur causality. Final image avoids scaffold, though minor synonym churn ("passionate subtlety"/"ethically playful") lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion but "soft" modifier overused ("softly," "soft sigh," "soft as a seed"). No loops or scaffold; final line ("act of unbinding silence") echoes earlier phrase purposefully. Figurative language never muddles closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-zero loops with high density, but "static seemed to taste of old rain" risks mixed metaphor (tactile/static vs. gustatory), and "scent of the petal lingering on her skin like a secret promise" leans toward cliché; final image retains clarity despite minor figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose soars in atmospheric moments ("constellations twinkled like lanterns"), but "cautious exuberance" scaffold loops in high-pressure beats (climax) dull immediacy despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density with strategic telling (e.g., compressed backstory on tag legend), but "luminescent ache" repetition (4x) creates synonym churn in peak beats. Opening scaffold ("perched at the edge") slightly dulls momentum, yet no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line's "rewrite the language of belonging" verges on abstraction but offset by preceding concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in high-pressure beat: "His purpose was gently inventive, a delicate dance..." tells rather than shows motivation. Otherwise, exceptional density ("polished ivory gleaming as if they held a secret heartbeat"). Rhythm varies naturally; no figurative muddle despite lush imagery. Final line achieves resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Sapphire hush" repeats 4× with diminishing returns, triggering paraphrase-loop penalty (-0.3). Otherwise pristine propulsion: "pulsed faintly when brushed" merges action/image. Final line’s "lingering shadows" avoids cliché through concrete antecedent ("flickering streetlights").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Most lines achieve high density, but final paragraph's template cadence ("He felt... He built... He introduced...") triggers loop penalty, dulling closure propulsion per Q7 artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops and high density, but "haggard awe" risks label-only feeling; elevated diction ("serpentine path," "unearthed convergence") stays within POV lexicon without muddling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Synonym loops ("steady hum"/"steady unpredictability") and redundant "bright darkness" repetitions in final beats reduce density; "warm shawl" metaphor slightly strains physical logic of darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence ("Days turned into weeks... each morning... each new sound") triggers -0.4; mixed metaphor ("brass chamber sang a complex melody") violates physical logic. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ despite otherwise vivid texture and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose density falters in climax: "trembling certainty" repeats verbatim (loop), and "whispered a promise to unseen architects" uses template cadence; otherwise strong specificity ("phantom energy seeped into lock’s mechanisms") avoids purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    No paraphrase loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("numbers glowed faintly, aligning into a forgotten prime sequence"), though "soundless music" slightly muddles metaphor in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; high density: "cursed fragment, glowing green against violet walls" does triple duty. Figurative language coherent even in climax ("dust sparkled, each particle a tiny echo"). Minor deduction for "magnetic resonance" vagueness in corridor description.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with vivid propulsion, but "liquid light, spreading like veins of gold" edges into overwriting; no loops in closure beat preserves momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-loop in "refract/refracted" repetition and scaffold ("he was earnestly studious") slightly dull momentum, but closure beat ("lamp’s ghost would hum") maintains crystalline clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in "each piece a layer... each snippet layered" creates synonym loop; otherwise, propulsion is masterful with "cold filament that tingled" offering textural specificity without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose loops mar momentum: "resonant hums" repeats identically across beats, and "gloomy cheerfulness" appears 4x with minimal variation. Strong textural specificity ("colors shifting like sunrise on a stormy sea") is undermined by paraphrase cycles in the cello’s description.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion with concrete verbs ("sprayed coded silhouettes"), but synonym churn ("relentless wonder"/"restless soul") and template cadence ("Every night... while...") dull immediacy in mid-beats. No closure artifacts preserve impact.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "pale plume of vapor rising like a ghost" exemplifies high-density prose doing triple duty (image/action/theme) without muddle; final line’s heartbeat echo achieves propulsion and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Minor density slip: "magnetic calm" repetition slightly blurs focus in the climax beat. Otherwise, propulsion is flawless—e.g., "vapor had turned ordinary illumination into a precise measuring tool" compresses setting/theme. Closure image ("drone’s tiny propellers whispered in sync with distant clatter") avoids muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor density issues ("worrying tranquility settle over her" slightly overwritten) but zero loops; final line’s cadence shift ("ice sang, and the world listened") achieves high-propulsion closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose excels in texture ("churned silver to calm amber hush") but has a paraphrase loop: "gathered hush" repeats identically in consecutive sentences near climax, slightly dulling closure propulsion. No figurative muddle, though "lonesome splendor" recurs without sufficient variation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Overwriting weakens peak beats: "stone walls breathing salty wind like an old sermon" muddles metaphor. "Copperlight repose" repeats 4x without pattern-teaching; final image ("beacon of truth") is clean but preceded by density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("coaxed dormant roots," "soil drank"). Figurative language maintains coherence ("liquid amber"), though high-density metaphors in early beats risk ornamental dilution without full payoff in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("each brushstroke seemed to sing a hauntingly optimistic lullaby" compresses action/theme). But "orchid" repetition verges on ornamental—three adjacent "orchid" references in final paragraph dull closure propulsion. No figurative muddle; cadence shifts with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Two paraphrase loops ("purposeful wandering," "cautious enchantment") dull momentum; "pale rivers of memory" overwrites tension. Final paragraph’s "stitching fragmented faiths" risks sentimentality but avoids fatal artifacts. Propulsion strong except mid-scene reflection on grandparents.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters in climax with back-to-back figurative language ("vibrated, edges shimmering with meaning... pulse of encoded hope"), creating minor scaffold that dulls closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Density suffers from mixed metaphor ("echoed silence pressed on ears") and "adjacent possibilities" loops. Strong final line offsets earlier scaffold, but synonym churn in conspiracy descriptions ("conspiratorial lines," "expose," "bribes") dulls momentum in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with clear propulsion, but adjacent metaphors ("living hymn"/"whispered verses") create subtle scaffold. "Fierce tenderness" recurs 4×, bordering on loop; final-third repetition caps Q7 below 8.8 despite lyrical control.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Overwriting dilutes climax: "twilight mist deepening into a dream-like veil that wrapped the translator in a lotus-hearted ache" stacks modifiers; template cadence ("She lifted... placed... When...") dulls closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "exposed film of ancient pigment hovered" demonstrates high density, though "trembling like chandeliers" risks mixed metaphor and "mist kiss her cheeks" edges toward cliché in final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor simultaneity error ("cascade of miniature auroras that painted") and template-like "nested awakenings" repetition; otherwise high density with no closure-obscuring artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    High density undermined by overwriting: "candidly cryptic verses" feels forced, paraphrase loops ("converging chaos" x2), and template cadence ("He whispered... He scattered..."). Final beat artifacts ("thriving chaos... spark safe") dull closure image, triggering -0.7 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line propulsion falters in "hearts gathered each sorrow like a slow-growing coral" (overwritten metaphor); "photosynthesize pain into beauty" edges toward thematic echo. Yet final line’s "reef-shadow joy, blooming eternally" achieves crystalline density with zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "refracting into a soft chorus of luminescence" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("foxglove regret") avoids muddle by tying to embodied sensation. Minor overwriting risk in "deserted marvels" offset by payoff in closure’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters with paraphrase loop: "cautious exuberance" repeats verbatim; "carefully reckless" label lacks embodied contradiction, diluting propulsion in climax beat despite otherwise vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor sensory repetition ("stone walls trembled"/"tremble into silence") creates a 0.2 loop deduction. Otherwise high density with propulsion: "rustled links singing," "ash particles aligning like ancient score" avoid muddle. Final line’s "ongoing encrypted compassion" achieves clarity without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with resonant phrases ("fractured hush"), yet "featherly determined" repetition and copper-wood vibration description risk overwriting in corridor discovery beat without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Template cadence cripples propulsion: 10 consecutive "She [verb]" openings in first 200 words. Mixed metaphor ("ash-black tip still humming") creates figurative muddle in pivotal feather placement beat.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stunning imagery suffers from density overload—"transliterates emotions," "fragile tide," and color metaphors repeat without pattern-teaching; minor loops in seed/glass descriptions dull closure momentum despite strong opening/closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose lush but scaffold in high-pressure beats: "calculated wilderness" repeats mechanically, and "twin guardians of chance" stacks abstraction. Final image suffers slight muddle from "faint imprint of a bishop’s crown" after physical wash.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor synonym churn ("obsidian grace" repetition) and density spike in "swallowing darkness" beat; no closure-dulling artifacts but prevents 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful rhythm, but "clear complexity" and "noctilucent reckonings" verge on stock metaphor strings in high-pressure beats. No closure-dulling artifacts, though repetitive abstract phrasing limits propulsion near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops and high density ("pine needles like distant applause"), yet "stars twirling in patient arcs that seemed to echo the beats of her own heart" edges into overwriting, dulling momentum in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density blurs cause/effect in climax ("needle dancing to cadence of decorative patterns"); "serene upheaval" synonym loops in final beats trigger -0.4 artifact penalty. Opening line’s stacked modifiers reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level propulsion stumbles in two spots: "wilted leaves" simile followed by "ghostly silhouettes" creates subtle synonym churn, and "rain-kissed lullabies" leans toward purple prose; otherwise, density and rhythm serve accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting in climax: 12+ metaphors in 80 words ("choir of tiny glass singers," "invisible ribbons of hope") create density muddle; template cadence ("He moved...", "The hush...") triggers -0.6 loop penalty in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor scaffold in paragraph 2 ("The map... traced... He had learned...") and three consecutive "He [verb]" stems weaken propulsion. No closure-impacting artifacts, but prevents 9.0+ with slight cadence rigidity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Overwriting in high-pressure sequence: "thousand tiny suns trapped within glass" and "scent of unresolved poems" blur action during thread-untangling. Template cadence ("She approached... She traced...") dulls immediacy near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "ribbons of starlight" avoids cliché by connecting to earlier comet simile. Deduction for paraphrase loop—adjacent beats repeat "uncommonly serene" without added pressure—dulling immediacy slightly in high-pressure revelation moment, but closure image remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting in final beat: 5 consecutive metaphorical phrases ("soft glow," "lingering knot," "dewy poetry") trigger density penalty. Paraphrase loops ("blushing stillness" x3) dull closure's momentum per Text-Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with propulsion ("cascade of tones spelling forgotten names"), but "snowmelt ardor" repetition creates minor scaffold. No loops in peak beats; final line ("past melt into present") resolves with resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    "Ethereal grit seep into her bones" triggers therapy-speak label penalty. Template cadence in bunker descriptions (-0.4) and synonym churn ("mournful yet mischievously hopeful") dull closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops ("empirically ironic" x3 with near-identical phrasing) and stacked modifiers ("soft violet glow rose, forming a bridge of light") obscure closure. Template cadence ("He worked... He set out... He returned") dulls ritual climax, violating Overwriting Checks.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor synonym loops (“shifting grace” repeated without pattern payoff) and slight overwriting (“living tapestry of soft, invisible currents”) but no closure artifacts. Propulsion excels (“Mara slipped the box... waiting”) with strong textural specificity. Density remains high without muddling peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative muddle in climax ("crystal facets reflecting orchard’s ghostly silhouettes like glass mountains") violates physical logic; paraphrase loops ("breath turning to crystal as the world held its breath") dull immediacy in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with propulsion, but minor scaffold in light descriptions ("filtered gold through stained glass" then "sunrise painted rafters amber"). No figurative muddle in peak beats—final line’s "accidental wisdom settled like dust" crystallizes theme with textural precision.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold in climax; "void inside surged" delivers high density. Slight paraphrase redundancy in bathroom sequence ("experienced philosophical breakthroughs... illuminating a different strand") prevents 9.3+, but closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.7)
    Line-level propulsion flawless: "stone cathedral" opening anchors voice/stakes; zero synonym loops. Figurative language never muddles ("whispered name" motif builds to "silence into song"). Final line recharges symphony motif with crystalline clarity despite high density.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    Severe paraphrase loops: "unkindled solace" repeated 5x with identical phrasing; "memories alter" echoed verbatim. Mixed metaphor ("rust of light") contradicts physical rules. Artifacts infect closure beat ("weight and release of unkindled solace now finally kindled"), disallowing 9+ globally. Template cadence ("She [verb]ed...") in carousel sequence triggers -0.6 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("latent enchantment awaken beneath her fingertips") propels momentum. Minor register drift in "fables of absence-stories" (hyphen error), but figurative language serves pressure without muddle. Final line’s "listened, content" resolves with textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold: "He began his work by examining..." followed immediately by action description. No loops, but "gently luminous" repetition (stone/aura) edges toward thematic echo. Final image ("caves breathed a steady lull") avoids muddle with high propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with near-zero loops, but "thin ribbon of light unfurls" risks purple prose in a high-pressure beat. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently, though "my motivation is simple yet stubborn" tells rather than shows, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Synonym loops ('solid fog... translucent slab... pale marble') and template cadence ('He began... He moved... He recorded') dull momentum in critical beats. Strength: 'stormlit hall seemed to inhale the clouds' shows textural specificity. Weakness: 'deepening hush settled like dust' muddles closure metaphor. Text-artifact penalty (-0.7) applied for final-third density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stunning imagery marred by late-third artifacts: "cascade of colored ribbons that spiraled like the kerosene rag knot itself" features mixed metaphor and synonym churn, dulling closure per Text-Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Minimal scaffold: "she was warmly observant" tells where showing would deepen pressure. No closure-impairing loops; lyrical density serves accumulation ("each ripple became a clue, each shimmer a sentence"). Final line’s "next ripple" recharges opening with zero muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stunning imagery marred by closure-beat loop: "filaments dissolved... leaving behind only lingering scent" followed by "retrieved the doll, now warm"—redundant phrasing dulls cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion but "in the quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo" repeats verbatim—minor scaffold loop preventing 9+. Final paragraph ("Dreams lingered") achieves perfect textural specificity. No figurative muddle; "prism facets catching light like fractured lullabies" integrates metaphor with action.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    Figurative muddle in peak beats: "forge a bridge of fire" clashes with digital motifs ("pixelated rain," "data trees"). Template cadence in action sequences ("She sallyed... She commenced..."). Final line’s "circuitry across the horizon" feels clichéd. No loops in closure beat, but density issues dim momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.7)
    Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to inhale," "sensed an audience") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; paraphrase loops ("burned bridges carefully" x2) trigger -0.5 penalty in climax sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    No loops or scaffold; "phosphorescent spores" to "luminescent spores" shows purposeful recurrence. Final paragraph's "abstract weight into literal sparkle" slightly over-tells. Zero figurative muddle despite dense imagery ("seam of light thin as a thought").

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    "Breathed a hush that felt eloquently silent" creates contradictory abstraction, while "ribbons of light" mixes sensory domains. Template cadence ("He realized...") near climax triggers -0.4 artifact penalty; prose remains lyrical but occasionally obscures cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless density: "pages curled like wilted petals" does triple duty (image/theme/motif); minor overwriting in "breath rang with promise of futures" redeemed by concrete "iron and jasmine" scent; zero loops or scaffold even in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("unfurling like a silent flag" → "unfurl another tale") and borderline cliché ("trembling like hope") reduce propulsion. No fatal artifacts, but syntactic monotony in final paragraph dulls closure's emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with "salvaged phone booth key—still warm" doing triple duty, but "phantom fireflies" edges stock metaphor. Zero loops; final third ("glittering waves") avoids overwriting through motif cohesion. "Liquid memory" metaphor sustains physical logic without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops but minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("silence, each breath a filament of color stretched taut"); density peaks during prophecy dissolution slightly blur causality without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Paraphrase loops weaken climax: "leaves formed luminous script... letters glowed"; "miniature altars" → "tiny tower" → "central tower" repetition; strong opening rhythm degrades in final third; no figurative muddle but scaffold reduces density.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero paraphrase loops; "drip-drip rhythm" slightly cliché but redeemed by "silver dust" and "ozone smell" specificity. Final line’s "swirl of hidden currents" avoids abstraction, charging closure with textural precision.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with zero loops in climax, yet "luminous regret" repetition (glowed with purpose → softened into gratitude) creates subtle synonym churn. Final line’s "droplet reminder" achieves textural precision but earlier "factual harmony with unseen ledger" risks abstract diction.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion: sentences vary rhythm (short staccato for action, flowing for reflection), but "luminous ache" appears twice in adjacent beats, creating a minor paraphrase loop. Zero figurative muddle; "sunrise glass" and "fireflies" metaphors stay coherent. Final line’s "symphony of light and ache" avoids overwriting through specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she braced") cluster in pivotal beats like the crystal roots revelation, dulling immediacy; otherwise lush prose with rhythmic control earns points but caps high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor overwriting ("breath for the living") and repetitive "elusively tangible" usage; high density maintained but slight figurative muddle in high-pressure alignment beat reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold. Every sentence multiplies purpose: "shattered marquee flapped like tired animal" establishes mood + decay. Final line's rhythm ("stars blinking to ticking heart") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor figurative muddle in peak beats ("shards scattering like rain" redundant with "shards fell"), but zero loops/scaffold. Final line ("clouds whispered back") resonant yet borders on cliché, avoiding closure harm.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops with high density ("silver rain" refracting history), but "burnished sorrow" appears 4x in final third bordering on scaffold; final line "humming a lullaby" risks sentimentality yet stays voice-coherent with "defunct rebellion" context.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence in high-pressure beat ("He circled... humming... for he knew...") triggers -0.4 penalty. Stock phrases ("garden of iron vines," "luminescence rose") clutter the midnight escalation, dulling immediacy despite lyrical strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "water trembling in the dark" exemplifies triple-duty prose. Final line ("ready to delve deeper") recharges "delve" with new meaning. Only hairline slip: "psychometry read those fragments" slightly abstract but redeemed by "sigh of tectonic plates."

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose excels with "weathered throat" metaphors and purposeful fragments, but "turbine-hum reverie" repeats verbatim three times, creating paraphrase loops that dull closure momentum despite strong cadence elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold in closure beats; "rivulets glittered like silver threads" paraphrase loop in mid-scene triggers −0.2. High density ("umbral tenderness of the moment wrapping") avoids purple prose through concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsion and textural specificity, yet filter-verb stacks ("Mara felt the weight") in the final third dull closure's immediacy, triggering a -0.5 artifact penalty and capping high-band eligibility per rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose soars in specificity ("cracked jars refilled with ideas"), yet paraphrase loops emerge in revival sequence: "lanterns reflected new households" followed by "soft glow testament to recalled intention" restates without advancing momentum. Figurative muddle in "fragile glass of remembered desire" strains closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "needle scraped a cracked groove, a thin thread of sound unfurled" avoids loops. Minor "rust" repetition (steel/wax) serves texture, not scaffold. Final line’s lyricism charges closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose achieves rhythmic control with varied syntax ("She lifted... placed it"), but high-pressure vortex scenes risk overwriting—"shards of time like crystal snowflakes" creates mild metaphorical muddle that dilutes causal clarity in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "humming veil" metaphor coheres with microclimate logic. Final line ("carrying the story to ears yet untrained") charges closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose sings with "amber hue spilled like molten sunrise" yet falters in "primal elegance settled" abstraction; template cadence ("The world's clamor faded, and...") dulls the closure beat's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "kaleidoscope of colors" achieves high density without muddle, though "memory of honey no longer sweet" slightly overwrites a high-pressure beat with redundant abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with clear propulsion, but figurative muddle in climax ("air grew suddenly timeless... strands shimmering with stories") risks obscuring cause/effect. No loops, though "silver sand" constellations slightly overwrites the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Severe overwriting: "woven dawns" (5x), "burnished hush" (3x) create synonym churn. Mixed metaphors ("kite string snaps... sending ripples") violate physical logic. Final image saved by "feather floating like solitary star" propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold with high density ("chlorophyll clouds from entwined roots"), though "bruised amber" sun and "petrified trees" risk mixed metaphors; final line's rhythmic control elevates closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion but "bronze quiet" repetition (4x) risks tic; final paragraph's "promise that home could be rebuilt" slightly overwrites the earned image, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with propulsion, but "dry husks unfurled like pale scrolls, each whispering a forgotten promise" risks overwritten abstraction in a pivotal beat, slightly muddling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero closure-impacting artifacts. Minor synonym loop: "tinting the revelations with violet hues" / "each hue a story." High density throughout, though "copper veins" repetition slightly dilutes propulsion in payoff beat.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold/loops; "smear of violet and ash" and "pulse like a heartbeat" achieve high density without figurative muddle; minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing barely touches closure’s lyrical propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but "glittering monolith" opener veers into cliché; no fatal loops though "sacredly playful" repetition slightly dilutes peak-beat density during final queen swap.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "secret script written on the world" charges closure without muddle. Minor deduction for dual "benevolently ruthless" repetition slightly diluting peak-beat immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; "vellum that pulsed with thunder" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "buried talents" (abstract phrasing) but redeemed by immediate concrete action ("pressed the feather deeper").

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density falters with scaffold phrases ("He remembered the day...") and near-duplicate sensory descriptions ("woven hush" repetition); propulsion slows in reflective blocks, though closure imagery ("platinum walls turning a softer hue") remains vivid and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery ("shards of secret confession"), but "refracted" repeats 8x, risking synonym churn in high-pressure beats. No scaffold loops, though final lines ("beacon for all who dared to repent") edge toward sentimentality. Opening anchors voice effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each line propels atmosphere ("acid-etched horizon" conveys stakes in three words). Figurative language ("uncertainty melted like frost under a furnace") remains coherent in peak beats, with final image ("sea’s surface reflected the sunrise") crystalline and resonant—no muddle near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwritten descriptions ("shafts of golden light, a pool of crystal water reflected...") create density muddle; synonym churn ("linger longer," "dissolve with the next sunrise") in high-pressure beats obscures causal flow.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor synonym loops ("softest whisper"/"gentle vibration") and elevated diction ("screaming tenderness") in high-pressure beats trigger −0.4; otherwise high density with resonant final image ("beam slicing the brightening horizon").

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    No scaffold loops or figurative muddle; sentences like "lanterns flickering like the censer foot’s patina" achieve high density. Minor cliché ("cracked hush") prevents 9-band but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion but "fractured grace" repetition and slight overwriting ("broken cathedral of fruit") create minor loops. No artifacts in closure beat, though "old sorrow" risks abstract label-speak near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops with high density, but "invisible ink" metaphor slightly muddles closure beat; strategic lyricism serves Accumulative lens without obscuring cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    "Lingering promise tighten around his chest like a rope" mixes metaphor and physicality, dulling closure beat; paraphrase loop in cataloguing new routes ("annotated with tiny chip that glimmered") triggers -1.5 accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Beautiful imagery diluted by scaffold: "bleeding starlight" recurs 4× without deepening, and verbatim "shared exhale" repetition in climax creates text loop that dulls immediacy without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural specificity ("nautilus shell columella curl," "whisper of sunrise") but suffers from template cadence ("He described... He explained...") and filter-verb stacks in para 5. Final line slightly overwrites ("night air hummed with possibilities"), though closure remains clear and propulsion adequate for length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose glimmers with textural precision ("pine scented air thin against the cracked window"), yet dense lyrical clusters in the dream sequence risk overwriting without clear pattern-teaching in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dangerous overwriting in closure beat: "trembling calm" appears thrice, creating paraphrase loops that dull the final image’s charge. Otherwise, exquisite density ("occluded views turned every object into a whispered silhouette" does triple duty).

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("saturated hush" repetition) and slight overwriting in high-pressure beats ("suspended breath of floating rock"), but no artifacts dull closure's luminous runes image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "induced currents" repetition (5x in climax) risks density overload; otherwise crystalline propulsion with textural specificity ("dusted relics can conduct grace") avoiding purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    "Resounding hush" paraphrase loop (3x in key beats) and "journeying inward" cadence rigidity dull immediacy. Beautiful texture but scaffolded phrases ("quiet paradox," "tangled narratives") reduce density; final image escapes artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Template cadence in counting beats ("each reversal a note... each pulse sent") creates scaffold loops; filter-verb stack in epiphany ("he realized... understood") dulls immediacy. No closure artifacts, but density issues in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.7)
    Overwriting in peak beats: "quiet surge, like embers sparking under ash" strains metaphor. Syntactic monotony in storm resolution ("The permeable barriers flexed...") and thematic echo in final paragraph trigger artifact deductions. Momentum loss from scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor scaffold in tunnel scene ("phosphorescent symbols formed a map... each intersection corresponded") bloats momentum. No closure artifacts, but "cryptic scrawls" overuse and purple prose ("veins of possibility") dilute density in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density falters with near-synonym loops: "ghostly glow" (booth) and "ghostly arpeggios" (disc) strain coherence. Final line ("promise etched into walls") avoids muddle, but "mournful glide" and "melodically haunted" risk figurative redundancy in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density marred by scaffolding: "perfume of salt and memory" redundantly follows "steep the sighs of sea." Template cadence in "He moved... each step..." dulls immediacy, though closure image ("dew on soul") remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "ivy fell back like curtains" merges action/image. Minor overwriting in "captive star" metaphor, but density soars in closure—"sun slipped behind ivy-clad arches" recharges the opening with zero scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Template cadence in "Each step... Each new phrase" creates paraphrase loop. Worst flaw: final "map of her soul" is therapy-speak label that dulls closure image, applying -0.5 artifact penalty in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "pen... inhale the altered history" (action/image/theme in one stroke). Minor purple prose in "luminescent buds that glowed with corrected data" costs 0.2. Final line propulsion flawless with "quiet rebellion against chaos."

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Overwritten cadence ("each ripple a silver sigh," "frozen memories") creates drumbeat rhythm in high-pressure beats. Template phrasing ("Arlen... Arlen... Arlen") triggers -0.4 loop penalty, muddling closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong density in opening, but "volcanic tenderness" repetition creates paraphrase loop (3x), and "fierce love tempered by gentle heat" mixes incompatible metaphors. Closure beat weakened by figurative muddle despite vivid phrasing like "murals spread like lava."

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops in closure beats ("night after night... each shimmering ripple... each drumbeat") dull immediacy. Otherwise high density with strategic telling; no figurative muddle, but cadence shifts lack variation in pivotal drumming sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong rhythm and specificity ("hiss of geomagnetic storm," "moth’s wing" voice) marred by minor artifacts: "calculated spontaneity" is clinical phrasing, and final "labyrinth breathe with his rhythm" borders on purple prose despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "spiralingly calm" repetition and "stillwater tension" echoes create subtle synonym loops in closure beats. Figurative language ("lattice of light unfurled") remains coherent without muddle, though "secret fireflies" verges on sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong propulsion with clean grammar but scaffolded abstractions ("forest of second thoughts") and one paraphrase loop ("quiet revolution"/"quiet storm") dull closure's charge. Final paragraph's thematic echo narrowly avoids severe penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but "combative tenderness" repetition (4x) borders template cadence in final third. Salt spray forming "vortex that lifted Mara's boots" exemplifies high-density imagery without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops in final third ("remade hush" repeated with minimal variation) and slight overwriting ("soft pulse of a remade hush") dull closure's edge. Figurative language remains coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle despite high density in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level propulsion falters with paraphrase loops ("tremor of certainty" x4); "watercolor of doubts" strains metaphor coherence, yet final image ("verse hangs like frost") achieves crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold/loops, but "bruised with orange and violet" creates subtle metaphor clash (bruises imply pain, beauty blooms from ruin) muddling clarity in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion ("room filled with low hum" → "cascade of synaptic sparks"), but scaffold appears in "powerfully gentle in their touch" (telling vs. showing) and "texture of connection" phrase risks thematic echo in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("genuinely artificial" repetition) and template cadence in middle beats, but no closure artifacts; high density maintained through resonant image compression.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor overwriting in "symbols that whispered of forgotten economies" dilutes momentum; otherwise, high-density prose ("tape snapped gently at critical juncture") drives propulsion without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density but "prismatic shards" repetition creates synonym churn; "smiled through tears" cliché dulls closure image. No artifacts in final beat, avoiding severe penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    Repetitive "luminous regret" and "softly deliberate" loops dull closure beat; otherwise strong rhythm, but text artifacts in final third disallow 9.0+ per penalty rules.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold loops ("shimmering stillness" ×3) and mixed metaphor ("convictions wobble like a candle... tugging like a taut string") dilute closure's impact; otherwise exemplary rhythm and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("frosted hourglass" described twice as "clouded"/"winter trapped") but high density otherwise. Final line’s "meteor hush radiance" crystallizes motif without muddle. No closure-tainting artifacts; propulsion maintained through sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose mostly lean but "spatially imaginative labyrinth" is label-only scaffolding. Near-closure risks therapy-speak ("empty chambers she had always sensed"). Final image propulsion strong yet minor synonym loops ("whispered/soft syllables") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal loops; "traced... traced" repetition in climax serves accumulation purpose. Final image ("crack in the night") avoids figurative muddle. Weakness: "roaring chorus" edges toward cliché in otherwise precise prose, slightly dulling closure's uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured lullaby" repetition is pattern-taught and reweighted meaningfully. High density ("lattice of wave functions charming existence") risks muddle but remains legible within the established lexicon, with final lines charging closure through concrete action ("sparks fell like rain").

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)
    Repetitive phrasing ("hum of insight" x4) creates paraphrase loops, especially in high-pressure beats ("surged," "amplify"). Overwritten density in climax dulls immediacy, though vivid verbs ("unfurling like birds") and purposeful fragments ("Each step echoed...") sustain propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Severe artifact penalty: "ticket punch with star stamp" repeats verbatim 5 times, creating synonym churn (stamp/punch) and template cadence in closure beats. Final-third prose muddle ("rows of faded letters that formed a map") dulls the chest-opening climax’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Color metaphor stack ("bruised sapphire"/"amber"/"copper") in high-pressure beat dulls closure image. "Frostbitten hope" synonym churn triggers -0.4 artifact penalty. Strong verbs ("pulsed," "glinting") offset density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "ink spread like a slow tide" avoids cliché while advancing plot. Final line "turned treachery into dust" crystallizes theme with high density. No figurative muddle in peak beats—collapse sequence uses concrete verbs ("spidered," "bowed," "mourned") without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops with high density, but "periodically eternal" repeats as ungrounded abstraction in emotional peaks, slightly muddling the coral epiphany. Final line’s "compass waiting to be recalibrated" achieves crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Loops undermine propulsion: "rusted" appears 4x in opening 70 words, "hum" 6x in climax. Filter-verb stack ("she remembered... she whispered... she felt") dulls immediacy during key stone interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    No fatal artifacts, but "amber cracked, a golden light spilled" suffers from sequential simultaneity error; high density in ritual beats compensates for isolated scaffold phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("wind tugged a pine needle across her cheek" embodies tension), though "pearl of stillness" risks metaphorical muddle if over-abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Overwriting in climax: "luminescent ache" appears four times within 150 words, violating density rules. Template cadence ("He lifted... He spread... He arranged") dulls immediacy in redesign sequence, with filter-verb stacks compounding momentum loss in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong density in desert descriptions, but adjacent synonym loops ("ephemeral patterns... ghostly tide") and overwriting ("serene anger melt into purpose, a fire") in final beat. Artifacts don’t touch closure but dull momentum (-0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Overwriting in peak beats: "contraband truths spread like frost on glass" followed by "reaching archivists... who had never dared to question" creates paraphrase-loop redundancy; template cadence ("each unlocking... each voice") dulls closure momentum in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe paraphrase loops ("stitching hope," "weaving continuity") and stacked metaphors ("calm fire ignite," "amber fire") obscure momentum; filter-verb clusters ("she felt," "she noticed") in high-pressure moments dull immediacy without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.3)
    Severe overwriting: 15+ stacked metaphors in climax ("wounded bird," "silver tide," "fireflies in dusk"). Template cadence in pressure beats ("He felt... He knew... He lifted"). Filter-verb stack ("He sensed the echo was not...") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with purposeful metaphors ("floating thought, solemn yet playful"), but minor muddiness in mid-beats (e.g., "orbits of regret" description strains coherence). Zero loops or scaffold in closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor overwriting in "meteor hush settled like stardust" slightly muddles closure’s clarity; otherwise, high density and propulsion prevail, though one near-synonym loop ("thrummed"/"breathed") in the final paragraph prevents 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stunning lyrical density marred by paraphrase loops ("each line was a question, each curve a tentative answer" adjacent to "forming a dialogue"); "as if the hush itself spoke" weakens metaphor in high-pressure climax.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with vivid propulsion ("cascade of light stitched the broken sky"), but "retrocognitively trapped" constitutes overwriting in high-pressure beat. Final thematic near-echo ("compassion could be engineered") risks dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose dazzles with textural density ("leaves whispering in synesthetic harmony") but "liquid violet" verges on overwriting. Zero loops; final image’s "luminous chime" propels closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor scaffold in "convinced that hidden geometry could translate..." slightly dulls propulsion, but high density dominates: "mapping each flash onto her own skin" does triple duty. No closure-tainting loops; final line's "fractally precise secrets" avoids sentimentality through concrete texture.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Factually mystical" register drift in high-stakes ritual beat triggers -0.4 penalty; otherwise zero loops with exceptional textural specificity in heat-mapping descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyrical prose suffers from overwriting: figurative language saturates high-pressure beats ("echo gathered the grains like memory"), with template cadence ("Mara believed... Mara set...") in the climax. Final-third synonym churn ("quietly inspired anew") triggers -0.7 penalty, disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in reflection ("He remembered the day...") slightly dulls momentum, but zero loops in closure beats; "phoenix" light metaphor avoids muddle by charging the valley’s healing with precise textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor synonym loop: "percolate through every breath" then "thoughts percolate into the mist" dulls immediacy. Otherwise stellar propulsion—sentences vary from fragments ("He began to stitch invisible threads") to flowing cadences. Final image ("surface smooth as a finished stitch") crystallizes without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "scattering it like gentle rain" risks purple prose but earns resonance via kindness motif; final line’s "faint thrum drifts outward" propels closure without muddle, though "sharp gentleness" repetition nears redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "moonbeams with rhythm of oars" integrates action/image without muddle. Minor overwriting in opener ("silver ribbons dancing") deducts 0.3, but peak beats ("hands moved in circles... vines responded") achieve high density. Final line resonates without telling.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative muddle in "atomically reflective" repetition (4x) and "sea of ink" metaphor dilutes closure impact. No loops in final beat, but density issues in high-pressure moments prevent 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Opening ("pale sunrise hovering on calm water") and closing ("harmonious chorus of prismatic quiet") recharge motif. But high-pressure beats risk muddle: "cascade of silver light" tracing "invisible thread" strains physical logic. Figurative density high ("sequined ribbons," "hush of centuries") yet closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density shines in "collective breath of a campus learning to listen," but synonym loops ("cautiously hopeful" x3) and mixed metaphor ("lighthouse... casting ethereal grit") dilute peak beats. Final image remains clear despite minor scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose dazzles with "blossoming map" and "luminescent fungi," but "heart beat prudently adventurous" is label-speak, and compass/key repetitions risk synonym churn in high-stakes beats without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; "thin line of blood" metaphor sustains without muddle. Final line ("silence forever altered") recharges "furrowed hush" with precision. One borderline abstraction ("strange alchemy") in peak beat prevents 9.2, but propulsion remains flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("spongey dread" x3) and template cadence ("She descended... each step echoed") in mid-section; high density maintained but "nervously confident" label weakens specificity during pivotal retrieval moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    No loops or scaffold; "trembling map" metaphor accumulates meaning without muddle; minor overwriting ("luminous disbelief" repetition) avoided cost in closure beat though "muted squares" phrasing edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "dusky harmony" repetition slightly dulls momentum, but zero figurative muddle in peak beats. Propulsion stays strong: "He placed a crisp franc on the first car..." uses concrete action to advance theme. Final line’s specificity ("measured hope") avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "midnight solace" appears three times with near-identical phrasing (paragraphs 3,5,6), dulling closure impact. Strong verbs ("humming with residue", "flickered acknowledging") offset occasional elevated diction ("lucid dream chronicler"). Final line avoids cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Figurative muddle in "sword unsheathed in peace" (9.3%) and paraphrase loop ("swirling orchard vortex"/"radiant garden of possibility") dulls closure. Strong propulsion in chant sequence but "hungry green glow" stock phrasing triggers -0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Template cadence ("She recalled... She understood... She reached") triggers −0.4 loop penalty; "luminous threads of hope" verges on cliché. Strength in "cool weight of centuries pressing into fingertips," but synonym churn ("anxious elation rose... rose to a roar") dulls closure beat momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-duplicate scaffold in "feeling the chill of centuries seep into her skin" slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise high density ("ash dissolved into a bright thread of amber" does triple duty) with no closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "corrugated walls humming with distant grind" achieves triple duty. Figurative language precise ("dust rose like slow sunrise") without muddle. Final line recharges "after the applause" motif cleanly—propulsion maintained even in lyrical density ("mind, confidently uncertain...").

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops in closure beats, but template cadence in "She had spent decades... Now, with the spirit..." and "She remembered... Now, the ladder..." slightly dulls momentum in reflection block.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with zero scaffold, but "silver water lapped against marble arches" borders on decorative. Final image ("beacon for wonder in the mundane") achieves crystalline propulsion, though two adjacent "glow" metaphors dilute peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    Template cadence in confession sequence ("The first confession... With each confession...") creates synonym churn. Final paragraph’s "vowed to spread the method" tells rather than shows, dulling momentum despite otherwise vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-perfect propulsion with purposeful fragments ("a sigh that resonated with the river’s own murmur"), but adjacent synonym loops ("daringly methodical" x3) and "crooked lines, as if the wall itself were a compass" slightly dilute density in mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor loops ("cyclically reversed" x4, "propagation delays" restated) dull momentum without harming closure. High density in peak beats but no figurative muddle; final line's scent/chime fusion demonstrates propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-zero loops with high density, but paraphrase redundancy in "propagate hope by reading... interpreting curling shadows" dulls immediacy; no figurative muddle in closure beat preserves momentum despite minor scaffold in mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-perfect density but "lucidly watchful" repetition creates minor scaffold; "radiant hush" risks becoming stock phrasing despite purposeful use. No loops in peak beats, though aurora descriptions edge toward overwriting without compromising closure’s clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative muddle in climax ("fermented grapes that lingered like a quiet hymn" conflates scent/sound) disrupts density. Template cadence ("She recalled... She took... She descended") in reflection beats dulls momentum despite otherwise vivid propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with strategic figurative language ("cloak of doubt," "prism of possibility"), but minor scaffold in "Mara, who was sincerely insincere..." dilutes immediacy; no closure-impairing artifacts yet slight overwriting in dawn descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion overall, but "sycamore" loops (4x) and mixed metaphor "age peeled away in reverse" muddy peak beats; final line's slight awkwardness ("teach the vanishing to appear") avoids major closure impact but caps high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor overwriting ("pulse left wandering between shadow and stone" strains metaphor); otherwise clean propulsion with zero loops, though one cliché ("dust on shoulders") dulls closure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "painting the world in a brilliant dimness that felt both hopeful and mournful" exemplifies high-density propulsion where metaphor clarifies emotional stakes without muddling closure’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=10.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture: "pages turning without wind, each leaf emitting a faint hue that seemed to vibrate in rhythm with his heartbeat" does triple duty (atmosphere, character state, theme). Final line’s "deepest ocean of forgotten libraries" recharges the opening motif with crystalline clarity. No figurative muddle—teal hue "pulsing like a heartbeat" avoids cliché while heightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    "Whispers of dying light" and "murmurs of ancient metal" form a paraphrase loop in high-pressure beats; elevated diction ("stellar doubt," "resonant reconfiguration") occasionally drifts from Silas’s implied lexicon during tension.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("dripping with the sighs of unkept promises" conveys emotion, setting, backstory). Figurative language serves pressure ("terror pulse like a second heart") without muddle. Minor abstraction in "resonance that bound the living to the dead" redeemed by later concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "rivulet of water traced the viaduct's stones" simultaneously advances setting, atmosphere, and dripping-rate motif—but "frozen river of light" risks stock metaphor in opening, narrowly avoiding figurative muddle under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level propulsion falters slightly in ritual climax: "phosphorescent snow" and "feathered scripts" risk density overload, though final pulse description ("gentle pulse radiated outward") maintains clarity. No loops, but near-synonym chains ("shimmered with vapor," "ancient freshness") dilute momentum in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Confetti" simile slightly overwrites during high-pressure revision beat; minor scaffold in "recalling...remembering" repetition, but propulsion remains strong through concrete verbs like "tightened," "slipped," "vanished."

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "slicing through pretense" phrase recurs with purposeful variation. Minor synonym churn ("luminous fluid" → "luminous fluid") in awakening beat costs 0.2, but peak beats maintain crystalline clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loop: brook "sang a low melody" then "rhythm mirrored ticking" restates atmosphere. "Orthogonal approaches" creates slight register drift. Otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully ("petals unfurled like a map of constellations"), and closure image avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "maculate" (Q9E) should be "macerate"—semantic error in pivotal verb triggers -0.5 penalty; otherwise, high density ("gusts to macerate stagnant air and reshape it into trembling chorus") fuels propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose dazzles with "frost-bitten volumes" and "veil of sleep," but stacked modifiers ("mist-shrouded," "frost-soft lucidity") in high-pressure beats slightly obscure causality; final image remains crystalline despite minor overwriting in the pendant approach sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym churn in "frozen bloom" repetitions; filter verbs ("he sensed") justified by contemplative mood. Zero loops in closure beat; final line avoids overwriting with concrete propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor density risk: "discarding assumptions about linear time and linear signal" slightly overwrites core idea. "Serenely electric" repetition functional as motif (3x) but borders scaffold in tuning beat. No closure artifacts; final line’s "catalogue the next hush" propels forward. Strong verbs ("cables humming," "spiral stairwell spiraling") avoid purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Overwriting in climax: "lattice of sound that glimmered like phosphorescent threads" violates density rule with stacked metaphors. Template cadence ("Lio [action], [consequence]") triggers -0.6 artifact penalty in high-pressure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero loops with high density, but "soft, golden rain" → "delicate strands that stitched ground to sky" borders purple prose in climax. Overwritten modifiers slightly dull closure's immediacy despite strong propulsion elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical density serves propulsion ("hull reflecting alien glyphs"). Figurative language avoids muddle: "anchor link’s weight shifted center of mass" concretely ties physics to thematic balance in the peak test-vessel beat.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with propulsion: "circuitry humming like a dying heart" compresses image/emotion. One paraphrase loop ("faint tremor... faint pulse") in opening beat. No figurative muddle in closure—light cascade crystallizes stakes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high-density lines like "droplets fall in chaotic streams that formed fleeting sigils" propel momentum without muddle, and final image ("rhythm of her heart align") crystallizes with absolute clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with minimal loops, but minor overwriting in "flawed diamond rumored to be cursed" (redundant "rumored"/"legends"). Final beat strong ("shadows whispered the same song"), though "audible sculpture" slightly strains metaphor. No closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("gravitational pull tugged at very air") with clear propulsion. Slight cadence template in final paragraph ("I walked... emerged... felt") prevents 9.0, but no figurative muddle—phosphorescent moss and draining phone battery create crystalline imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; high density ("vibrating with cadence of his heart, a signal meant to uproot fear" compresses action/theme). Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" near climax slightly dulls immediacy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("clinking token" anchors scene economically). Metaphors coherent ("storm erupted in flash that blinded optics"), final line recharges motif without muddle. Propulsion flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    High textural density but suffers paraphrase loops: "misting hush" repeats 5x with minimal variation, and "whispering gleam" cadence becomes mechanical (e.g., "breathed in the whispering gleam... pulse with train’s heartbeat"). Final paragraph’s "soft tide" borders on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("rustle of vellum and electronic sighs"). Minor deduction for "observed solitude" scaffold (label reused line 24/42 without deepening), bordering paraphrase loop. No figurative muddle; final line’s "soft sigh of pages turning" crystallizes closure without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("sunrays trembled over the reef") advances atmosphere without muddle. Final line ("scent of jasmine answer the unanswered questions") avoids cliché through concrete specificity, satisfying 9+ quick test with flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("disorienting him with every stride. Each step echoed...") but zero closure artifacts. High density with clear propulsion; "doubts sway and dissolve" avoids cliché. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with zero loops; "crisp nostalgia" charges closure, but near-duplicate phrasing ("broken and rearranged," "scattered like driftwood") in high-pressure beat slightly dulls propulsion without harming causality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Near-cliché "breathed a sigh of relief" in final paragraph triggers -0.3 deduction. Otherwise strong propulsion with purposeful compression ("vaulted ceiling lifting like a chest relieved of a long-held breath"), though "geometry of tea leaves" borders on thesaurus-itis without sufficient payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose loops weaken closure: "radiant hush" repeated 3x in final paragraph. "Succor" synonym-churn (4 uses) creates scaffold without pressure. Final line summary ("hope blossomed anew") dulls the earned image of glyph-imprinted rain.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density with propulsion ("Each knot was a memory, and each memory was a restless spirit"), though "a lucid unrest, a calm yet uneasy feeling" borders on looped abstraction. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; final image ("stars above traced new patterns") charges closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.8)
    No loops or scaffold; "pallid white drizzle that seemed to wash away the edges" achieves high density without muddle. Final line’s "rewrote the borders" recharges "stone echo" with conceptual precision.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Severe overwriting in high-pressure beats: "frozen flakes that swirled like memory," "pulse of light to travel," and "melancholic tone reminded him of the world above" create figurative muddle. Template cadence in wire-untangling sequence dulls immediacy despite lyrical intent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops with strong propulsion, yet "tinkersong wonder that stitched sky to earth" suffers mixed metaphor in climax. Technical terms ("fragmented consciousness") blur clarity where concrete sensory detail would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting dominates peak beats: "prismatic shards that danced" and "thrums with a low, melodic hum" stack metaphors without pattern-teaching; template cadence ("He lifted... He read... He returned") triggers -0.6 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Adjacent paraphrase loops ("stitched together the spooled wholeness"/"looping back into a tapestry") and therapy-speak ("even absence can echo") in high-pressure beats undermine momentum; final line’s lyricism salvages closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion stumbles in high-pressure beats: "each particle placed with a fractally precise hand that seemed to echo the coin’s tiny grooves" stacks redundant modifiers, dulling the climax’s immediacy despite otherwise vivid rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("humming grew steadier" repeated) and three consecutive "she" openings in climax prevent 9+, but propulsion remains strong with no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold, with high density ("filament of light that curled like a whisper"), but "hauntingly bright" appears 3x with minimal variation, creating a near-synonym churn in the climax; no figurative muddle, though "trembling like sea-foam" slightly strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush yet occasionally overwrought ("brambled hope" repeated without evolution). Minor paraphrase loop in final paragraph ("forever strange yet trusted, sowing messages..."). Zero artifacts in closure beat, but "strangely trustworthy" is label-only in high-pressure context.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Zero loops but "bruised awe" paraphrase cluster (3x in 150 words) and "like a promise" simile in peak action violate density rules; "glowing with quiet fire" rescues closure image from overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; "fruit to ash" to "ash on tongue" reprises with cost, but "jagged elegance that feels like a wound" risks stock metaphor—elevated by context yet slightly overwrought in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "frosted the canyon with foam that rose and fell in rhythmic arches" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting in DNA simile ("twisting like intertwined strands") but redeemed by later specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "spilling silver onto floating aisles" to "inked floor with silver letters" shows purposeful recurrence. Minor density issue in "mindfully scattered" repetition. Final beat's "cool silver thread weaving" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose dazzles with textural density ("walls seemed to weep tiny droplets of brine"), but "sandpaper rough memories" creates a mixed metaphor (abrasive vs. smoothing) that muddles physical logic in a pivotal beat, slightly dulling closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("borrowed starlight" repeats without evolution). Overwritten phrases like "soft sunrise captured in amber" dilute momentum. Final line’s "breathed as one" compensates with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Synonym churn on "synaptic plasticity" (3x repetition) and "quaking reverie" creates density loops. Stacked metaphors ("liquid quartz" tools, "dormant dreams" wind) blur causality in setup. Final beat clean but earlier artifacts dull closure’s immediacy—text loops cap high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong propulsion early, but inversion scene suffers from stacked metaphors (“water swirled upward glittering in reverse”) and paraphrase loops—“latent blaze” repeats 4x without evolution. Final line (“quiet hum of new luminous lamps”) resolves with textural specificity, yet density issues in peak beats prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong textural specificity ("crystal-clear echo," "glass harp") but figurative muddle in high-pressure beats ("vibration traces the crack’s lineage"); template cadence ("He believed... so he began... Auris placed") dulls immediacy without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Minor scaffold in "whispered to the stone... stone responded" (adjacent paraphrase loop) triggers -0.2. Otherwise flawless propulsion: "magnetic currents waned, but the stone’s dent glowed" compresses consequence without redundancy. Figurative language serves momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    Overwriting in peak beats ("walls expanding like lungs prepared for a collective exhale") creates mixed metaphor; scaffold phrasing ("moved with theatrical sincerity, bowing...") dulls immediacy. No closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose loops ("wildflower hush" x4, synonym churn for serenity) and template cadence ("Lira moved... slipped... planted") accumulate in final third, dulling closure. Filter-verb stacks undermine sensory immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density multiplies jobs per line ("river ran upward, its current defying expectation"). Final image avoids abstraction through sensory "humming," though "murmurs of past pilots" edges cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Red needle trembling like a nervous heart" introduces cliché in high-pressure beat; otherwise, lyrical density ("tapestry of future movement") avoids scaffold with purposeful rhythm shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Figurative density risks overwriting ("tide of luminous chords," "brushstroke that opened fissures") but avoids closure-dulling; minor synonym loops ("colors of the aurora" repetitions) limit higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops; every line propels atmosphere or character. "Avalanchingly quiet" avoids cliché through precise integration. Minor deduction: "promise a song that could open seams" slightly tells rather than shows in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    "Lucid turbulence" repeats without evolution (paraphrase loop), and "mathematics of emotion" drifts into abstraction; final "universe’s equation unfold" edges toward thematic echo but avoids outright moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "ribbons of dancing light" shows textural specificity. Final "humming light" recharges opening shard motif. Hairline slip: "sunrise-kissed leaves" borders cliché but redeemed by context. Propulsion flawless—every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but "shifted hush" repetition creates paraphrase loops (4x). "Truthful lie" phrasing borders on template cadence. Final line’s "loss and gain" abstraction slightly dulls closure image. No critical artifacts, yet density falters in peak beats with mixed metaphor ("pulse of grief that seemed to belong to a traveler").

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Stoically sparkling" repetition forms paraphrase loops in high-pressure beats (climax), muddling immediacy; otherwise strong density and rhythm, though final line's ornamental reuse triggers artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("quietly determined" re: hammer/smile) and overwrought density ("twin horizon of hope and doubt") cause slight momentum drag. No closure-dulling artifacts, but "rubble pulse like heartbeats" repeats earlier metaphor, violating high-band line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density ("sensory maps pulsed stronger here, each line now a bridge" advances plot/theme). Figurative language avoids muddle even in climax ("walls dissolved into a cascade of light"), with final line recharging shard motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "luminescent ache" in peak beats risks overwritten abstraction; no loops, yet "ghostly light"/"faint echo" proximity edges toward cliché without sufficient textural distinction in high-pressure lamp-out sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure-beat artifacts: "Lira, now a conduit... lifted a cup" uses passive voice and stacked filter verbs. "Quietly explosive" repeats 4x with synonym churn ("soft silver," "thin sun trails"), muddling peak imagery while obscuring closure's causal charge.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal scaffolding—"lattice of sorrow" immediately operationalized as humming filaments. Avoids peak-beat overwriting but "wisps of smoke" adjacent to "half-remembered songs" risks paraphrase loop (-0.2). Final line ("lingering glow... waiting to be measured") delivers propulsion without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density overwhelms closure beat: "ribbons of light seeped into soil" + "vines of silver bark rose" + "darkness pulling back" creates muddle. Template cadence in "Lira felt... Lira raised... Lira whispered" triggers -0.4 loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong rhythm and specificity marred by minor synonym loops ("humming with hidden dialogues"/"volumes humming with riddles") and two "enlarged tranquility" repetitions diluting climax.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops with high density ("crumbs fell onto tea leaves like tiny punctuation marks"), but "uncloak its hidden purpose" and "heuristically gentle" constitute elevated diction clashing with POV lexicon in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("quartz hush settled like snowfall on her shoulders" echoes earlier descriptions) dulls closure's edge. Otherwise, propulsion is flawless: "shedding shards of silver that pierced the library's ceiling like needles of revelation" does triple duty advancing plot, atmosphere, and theme without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion; minor scaffold in "comforting unease" repetitions. "Brittle note that once echoed" shows textural density without muddle, final image crystallizes closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft dazzles with "lavender scent curled like soft binary code" and rhythmic propulsion, but minor synonym loops appear: "luminous skeptic" echoes "skin glowed faintly" within 3 lines, and "sweet metallic note" recapitulates earlier "metallic tang," slightly muddying peak-beat density.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "trembling care"/"inescapable calling" phrasing; otherwise, zero loops and high density ("shards shifted, aligning spontaneously") propel closure without muddying the vial’s release.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "whispered a simple truth" weakens pressure in peak beat via passive verb, costing 0.1 from 8.8 ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.3)
    Severe figurative overload: "glisten" repeated 6x with near-identical phrasing ("glisten brighter," "glisten of ice"), creating synonym churn. Closure beat ("kinetic sculpture still moves, a slow heartbeat...") suffers template cadence and mixed metaphor. Artifact in final third disallows 9+ globally per Q7 rules.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    Repetitive "sandstorm calm" (5x) and "led through following" create text loops; thematic echo in final paragraph triggers -1.1 artifact penalty, dulling closure's resonance despite lyrical strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting plagues closure: "encoded whispers" and "web of solidarity" stack mixed metaphors; "spider spins its web" simile recurs mechanically, dulling the final image's causal clarity per Text-Artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "pockets of gravity fluctuated... pulling at boots" then "feeling pockets shift" dulls mid-scene immediacy. Otherwise high density—no figurative muddle—but artifact caps 9+ globally per policy.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("smoothed hush" variants) and "tranquil blaze" repetitions dull precision in high-pressure beats. Otherwise stellar propulsion: "paper feathers fluttering without wind" exemplifies textural density. No closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with zero scaffold but "murmurs embedded in brick" risks abstraction in high-pressure beat. Final line’s "speak to us without secrecy" crystallizes propulsion. Near-miss figurative muddle in "stitch the night’s fleeting light into brick’s silent grammar" limits score.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.7)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "tragically radiant" (x3) and "resonance structures" (x5) form synonym loops; lyrical density obscures causality though final image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "calibrated treason against the pure lineage of calligraphy, a subtle rebellion inked in blood" strains metaphor coherence. Template cadence ("each night... each stroke... each line") dulls immediacy near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density with vivid "quartz light" imagery, but stacked modifiers ("trembling chord," "luminous threads") in climax risk figurative muddle. No scaffold loops, though "serpentine nexus" feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "amber glow" to "beacon" reprise avoids overwriting, but "filaments" metaphor slightly strains when applied to both ice and memory in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Template cadence ("He [verb], his [noun] [verb]-ing") repeats in final third ("He walked...," "He arrived..."). Filter-verb stack ("felt the weight," "felt patterns settle") dulls immediacy. Gorgeous imagery undermined by scaffold in closure beats, disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("shredded letters, torn from old corporate memos") with concrete propulsion. Minor deduction: "pulse in the air" borders cliché but redeemed by immediate physical consequence ("world held its breath").

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dense figurative language in climax ("heart a steady drum of gritty whimsy") triggers overwriting penalties in final third. Paraphrase loops on "variant allegiance" and "ancient shadows" dull immediacy. Strong opening/final lines anchor momentum, but template cadence in mirror-arrangement beats impedes propulsion. Artifacts prevent 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with minimal scaffold; 'sweeten' repetition serves motif not loop. Final 'redemption' line skirts sentimentality but remains earned. No figurative muddle in peak beats despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density falters with minor scaffold ("noted the note hovered") and borderline purple prose ("fleshly ethereal glow"), but propulsion remains clean; no closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    "Reverberate" repeats verbatim three times creating paraphrase loops; "entangled memories" synonym churn in opening paragraph dulls immediacy, though final image's "lullaby" achieves high density without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    "Vibrant hush" scaffold loop appears in climax ("shop seemed to hold its breath again, vibrant and hushed"), dulling closure image. Template cadence ("By the way light breaks") triggers -1.7 penalty as artifact touches final beat, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("glowed like phantom breadcrumbs," "resurrected log singing echoes"). Final line crystallizes theme without telling. Figurative language serves pressure: "hum of forgotten data like distant choir" establishes tone without muddling causality in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with purposeful imagery, but figurative strings risk muddle in restoration beat ("scattering into a thousand specks... mirrors sighed"). Template cadence in mirror descriptions ("Another mirror showed...") triggers minor momentum drag without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong density but subtle scaffold: "trawling for supplies, for stories, for elusive cadence" risks template cadence. Final paragraph slightly overwritten ("journals pages fluttered like the wind"). Zero fatal artifacts; avoids filter-verb stacks. Costly loop penalty avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.1)
    Severe template cadence: "by drawing parallels" repeats 4× consecutively in climax with identical structure. "Amber" overuse (7×) and synonym churn ("patient cool"/"stubborn mismatches") dull closure momentum despite lyrical highs.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats but "conjured clearing" repetition (4x in 80 words) triggers −0.3 loop penalty. Textural specificity triumphs ("whisperfield calm", "violet robes"), yet synonym churn on "peripheral awareness" dulls closure's final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops; "vines climb" repetition is pattern-taught. Minor overwriting in "pulsed with the collective heartbeat of the village" risks purple prose, but density remains high. Final line’s "timeless canvas" elegantly recharges lavender/rust motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet precise ("marble floor," "oak table"), but "sonically reflective" recurs like a scaffold loop in key beats (dawn light, crystal tones, lullaby), diluting momentum; no fatal artifacts, yet minor overwriting in the climax ("chorus of quiet tones") blurs immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with zero scaffold—every line advances atmosphere or character (e.g., "chalk dust on weathered slab" conveys impermanence). Minor loop: "echoes" repeated 5x in final paragraph slightly dulls closure’s charge. No figurative muddle; "faint resonance rose like a ghost ship’s horn" avoids cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion but "luminous ache" repetition (5x) risks synonym churn; "changelessly constant" stated without embodied demonstration in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    High density with lyrical propulsion, but figurative language overloads peak beats (e.g., "kite catching first wind of dawn" during death). No loops, yet "decisively kind" repetition and template cadence in final paragraph slightly obscure closure’s emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("quietly deliberate" repetition); "thrummed with the heartbeat" borders cliché but final beat remains clear—no figurative muddle in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density weakens climax: "glowing point of possibility," "melody of repair," and "embryonic galaxy" stack without pattern-teaching. No closure artifacts, but synonym churn in "shrewdly innocent" repetitions dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    No scaffold loops, but "reflectively vibrant" repetition (3x) and near-strained metaphor "glass sang a soft zephyr bloom" create minor density artifacts in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose loops ("each step measured, each breath a promise") and template cadence in climax ("She placed... She felt... She solemnize") dull immediacy. Seashell's "quiet song" metaphor strains coherence, though final line's reprise ("compass toward unseen stories") redeems density.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with minor redundancy ("golden threads... spinning golden stories"). No closure-dulling artifacts, but "forest seemed to smile" edges toward cliché, slightly diluting final image. Propulsion strong through varied syntax and purposeful concrete nouns ("brass instrument," "glowing pollen").

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Near-flawless propulsion: 'cascade of quiet fire' binds action/image without overwriting. Minor density risk in 'luminous veins' metaphor but payoff in heartbeat mapping justifies it. 'Moving stillness' repetition functions as intentional lyric motif, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Beautiful rhythm but paraphrase loops: "peripherally focused/peripherally aware," "ripple outward like a tide of whispers/chorus of stored wonder." Filter-verb cluster ("sensed... decided... set up") dulls the crystal-insertion climax.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    Severe overwriting: 72% of high-pressure beats deploy stacked metaphors ("eyes braided with patterns of light," "dreamlike fog of memory"), triggering -0.7 penalty. "Shingled hush" repetition (5x) crosses into scaffold without sufficient pattern payoff, dulling closure's emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; "rust-hued peace holding the world in a single breath" compresses time/space/emotion. "Tiny metronomes" replaces abstract time with concrete image. Near-flawless density but "hauntingly practical" slightly elevated for POV lexicon in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor paraphrase looping ("each shard sharpened her resolve"/"each regret added weight") slightly dulls momentum, but high density prevails—every sentence advances atmosphere or character, and the final image ("world breathe as one") avoids cliché with precise textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold: "echo of departing carnival lights" paraphrased later as "carnival's departure emptied the town." No closure artifacts; high density in conduit rerouting beats sustains propulsion without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Severe paraphrase loops (identical rain-memory passage) and "excruciatingly gentle" overuse in the closure beat create scaffold that dulls the final pulse image; filter-verb stacks cluster in reflection sections.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    Template cadence in pivotal lock scene ("He drew... He lifted... He moved... He realized") triggers -0.6 artifact penalty; "thoughtfully clear" synonym churn obscures closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally per rubric rules.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence ("He was... He knelt... He traced") triggers -0.5 penalty; otherwise vivid propulsion, but figurative density ("breath held by sea") occasionally obscures tactile immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats, but "sigh of rustling leaves" and "lonesome splendor" verge on cliché; high density falters in mid-scene where "projected his presence" lacks concrete mechanics, slightly dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Severe figurative muddle in climax: "burst of feathered light erupted, scattering... igniting pistons with song of wind" obscures cause/effect. "Bitterly sweet" label appears 3x as empty repetition; final thematic statement triggers -0.8 artifact penalty in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Severe overwriting in high-pressure beats: "sang a faint, resonant tone, as if the scar of the sand itself were humming" mixes contradictory metaphors (scar/humming), muddling causality; figurative density obscures the graft’s physical action, dulling closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-redundancy in "resonated with a defiant hush, as if the city held its breath" slightly dulls momentum. Otherwise pristine: high density ("spilling cascade of tiny lights"), no loops, and final line’s "newly awakened heart" avoids cliché. One scaffold phrase blocks 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density with propulsion ("released a soft pulse. The pulse traveled outward...") but adjacent lines risk synonym loops ("falling petals drifted like paper lanterns... petals fell in slow, mournful tides"). Figurative language dominates key beats without pattern-teaching, dulling closure’s immediacy despite lyrical beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose achieves high density with near-zero scaffolding, though "quiet, thundering calm" repetition risks slight cadence rigidity in high-pressure beats. No fatal artifacts—figurative language consistently serves accumulation without muddling closure's visceral charge.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting cripples momentum: "splintered by years of salt, each fragment etched with tiny inscriptions carved" exemplifies paraphrase loops. Final beat's "chorus of countless souls" is thematic echo, while filter verbs ("Mara felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments, disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "groundedly imaginative" repetition; otherwise clean propulsion. Final line ("bright horizon of a transformed people") recharges motifs without muddle, but "blank page bounded by ice" slightly echoes earlier phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but scaffold issues: redundant "calm precision"/"thistled calm" and three consecutive "she" stems in transcription beat. No closure artifacts, but loops prevent higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    No loops or scaffold; high density ("powder's glittering veil" → "delicate lattice"). Slight overwriting in "frozen breaths of lost time" but pattern-taught and payoff justified in crystallization imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold loops; "cog placed at the page’s edge" charges closure with crystalline specificity. Minor register drift in "nurturing a chorus of truths" risks thesaurus-itis but stays voice-coherent; propulsion flawless through concrete verbs like "sift" and "churn."

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Near-zero loops with high density ("zither’s rosette glowed brighter with each passing phrase" does triple duty), but "traveled stillness" repetition creates a minor scaffold. Final line’s slight sentimentality ("blossomed anew within every heart") avoids purple prose through concrete antecedents.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high density in "vines responded to rising hum, unfurling leaves that seemed to pulse." But "synaptic pathways of plants’ nervous filaments" introduces clinical diction jarring with lyrical voice during critical seed-planting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold in closure beats, but "nectar dusk" slightly risks purple prose in high-pressure moment. Final line's "wonder would never again be dimmed by routine" leans toward thematic echo despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops in closure beat, but "hushed blaze" repetition (opening/closing) creates paraphrase scaffold. Overwritten phrases ("amber halos stretching like lazy thoughts") slightly blur immediacy during shard discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density and propulsion marred by adjacent paraphrase loops ("threaded a filament... traced a thread") and minor synonym churn; no artifacts touch the closure beat, but scaffolding slightly dulls mid-scene momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops in closure beat; high density ("deliberate imbalance that paradoxically stabilized"). Synonym loop in "whisper of kinetic potential"/"metaphor for boundless confinement" loses 0.3. Final image crystallizes with clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Overwriting in "bristles forged from silvered sap that seemed to capture the moon itself" dilutes momentum; paraphrase loop ("methodically hopeful"/"worked methodically") triggers -0.3, but propulsion recovers before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    No loops or scaffold; "anxiety melting like frost" shows rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in "emerald-tinted lens caught a flash of emerald light," but density serves Accumulative lens without muddling closure’s "prism of hope" image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density but "latent radiance" repetition creates scaffold in high-pressure beats. Final line ("rewriting fate") avoids overwriting, though "dying star" metaphor borders on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Metaphor clash in climax ("shudder rippled... unspooling shadows like ribbons") obscures causality. Final third artifacts ("repulsive allure" repetition) block 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or action ("fractal patterns exploded outward, sending ripples of sound"). High density without muddle—"battered xylophone mallet, its wooden head worn smooth"—avoids purple prose while charging closure with "wood warm with memory." Minor "restless euphony" repetition stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-loop in "spiral-shell cartographer whose maps spiraled" but purposeful. High density maintained; final line’s "horizon that no longer seemed unknowable" avoids abstraction. Slight scaffold in exposition prevents 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with dual-purpose prose ("glass fragments of fractured memories" merges setting and theme), but slight overwriting in "silver ink swirling like moonlit water" risks muddling the high-pressure beat. Zero loops or scaffold; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. Final image clarity remains uncompromised, though one elevated phrase nudges register beyond strict POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Minor scaffold in reflective sections ("cataloguing ghosts of structures left to rot") and redundant "interlaced absence" repetitions (4x) dull momentum. Strong concrete verbs ("wrest," "waded") counterbalance, but figurative muddle ("hushed blaze") lingers in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "dappled resolve" and "reclaimed stillness" recur with purposeful specificity (lantern light → buoy glow). Final line’s "chronicle the next chapter" avoids closure muddle, but "mournful sigh" slightly risks sentimental phrasing without deeper embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting check fails: figurative language saturates climax ("origami cranes now swirl among stars... sorrow turned into hope") without pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphor: "glass envelope thin as a sigh" then "light ripple like water" violates physical logic. Template cadence in para 3 ("He works... He lifts... He watches...") triggers -0.6 penalty. Final third artifacts disallow 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("valves hissing like dying beasts" → "thrusted his palm"). "Intangibly tangible" avoids abstraction through physicality ("air feel heavier than stone"), though one borderline label instance prevents 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in "perpetually surprised" repetitions dulls momentum. Otherwise, high density ("crystal prism shimmer like distant sunrise trapped inside stone") avoids muddle, though "last sigh of day" borders on stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion overall, but "sieved hush" repetition risks synonym churn (three near-identical uses), and "metronome of redemption" slightly muddles metaphor—mechanical precision clashes with organic redemption—though neither artifact dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose sings with rhythmic control ('moon, veiled behind clouds, marked the schedule'), yet synonym loops ('weather-worn resolve'/ 'storm-worn, windblown parapet') and triple 'furrowed hush' repetitions slightly muddle momentum in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Template cadence ("He lifted... He set... He felt...") triggers -0.4 penalty; otherwise high density with "liquid glass" specificity, though "doubts melt into vapor" slightly overwrites emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Filter-verb stacks ("I learned," "I recognized," "I felt") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; otherwise vivid prose with strong cadence, but scaffold prevents 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops ("paradoxically steady" reused), template cadence in ritual sequence, and mixed metaphors ("space thinned to filament of shared breath") dull closure image; artifacts pervasive in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mixed metaphor ("choking beauty that wrapped the soul in velvet") violates physical logic, and paraphrase loop ("spilling tiny shards that sang... shards that sang") triggers -0.4 deduction, but closure remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Gravitationally lighter" phrasing ("impossible physics whispered through her bones") uses abstract label instead of concrete sensation in high-pressure beat, triggering -0.4 loop penalty. Otherwise strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwritten density in peak beats: "whispering hush that seemed to hum with unseen currents" compounds sonic metaphors. Template cadence ("Mara believed... Mara recalled... Mara lifted") dulls immediacy during prophecy reflection, violating propulsion standards for Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Severe template cadence ("his eyes scanning... his curiosity turned") and synonym loops ("calmly inventive precision"/"calmly inventive yet urgent") in high-pressure beats. Filter-verb stacks in closure ("Kael placed... device emitted") dull the revolution's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Severe overwriting in climax: "violet flame rose like second sunrise" + "tide seemed to pause, listening" + "borrowed dawn sharing its light" creates figurative muddle. Template cadence in rock-placing sequence ("She [verb], [verb]...") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "lightning etched silver veins" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "furiously tranquil" repetition (3x) approaching template cadence in high-pressure beats, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Minor scaffold loops ("hidden overture" → "overt theme") and "dignified chaos" repetition dull immediacy. High density compensates, though "mechanized arm whirring down like a sigh" risks purple prose without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative overload dilutes tension: “shelves into an altar,” “mosaic of green light,” “voice a trembling candle” in high-pressure scenes. Template cadence runs (“Lira... Rook...”) across discovery beat. Filter-verb stacks (“Lira, now wearing...”) dull immediacy where momentum matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    No paraphrase loops, but "flickering compasses" density in high-pressure beats borders on overwriting. Final image ("taste of steel and longing") edges toward overwritten lyricism without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor paraphrase loop in dream translations ("jade vine became... orchid's pulse became...") triggers -0.3 deduction; otherwise crystalline density ("leaves shimmering like silvered pages") with purposeful cadence shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Overwriting in climax: "cerulean regret" and "rhythmically placid" repeat like a mantra, diluting impact. The compass’s "soft glow" bathes the scene in vague abstraction rather than concrete sensory propulsion, muddying closure’s emotional charge.
